IN'DUSTRIAL SCHOOLS BILL.
Sir S. NORTHCOTE moved the second reading of this Bill.
iMr. ALCOCK moved, as an amendment, that the Bill be read a second time that day sixn months. In his opinion the Bill was superfluous, because, as the law now stood, it was the duty and practice of the police to take and see properly provided for any destitute children wandering about without the means of subsistence. Within the last few years there had been established district schools, not only for maintaining and clothing children, but also for the puxpose of teaching them some trade, by which they might earn a livelihood. Some of the children were trained up in agricultural pursuits. These schools were of a superior kind, many of them having cost 30,0001. or 40,000oo, and they were well looked after by Government inspectors. Such care did the guardisns bestow upon the establishments in question that the average expense for the children per head per week was 8s. Sd.; and now the non. baronet suggested by his Bil a cheaper method, and put, as the basis of his plan, the average cost per head per week at 3s. If schools were established under the present Bill, what would be the course pursued by the guardians of the district schools, now payiug an average cost per week of Ss. Sd. for the children? Was it reasonable to suppose that they would continue to pay that sum when they would have the opportunity, if the present Bill passed, of sending their destitute children to these new schools for :s. a-week each ? It was assumed, he imagined, that some charitable contributions would be made to the schools, or otherwise they could not be supported at the rate he had mentioned. As far as concerned vagrant children, there were reformatory prisons already in existence, and a Bill had also been proposed by the Rome Secretary for facilitating the establishment of reformatory schools. Therefore the measure would be a superInous piece of legislation; but his chief objection to it w;asthat it seemed to have the effect of raising ragged schools (a term in itself disgraceful) into a position of importance And permanence. He was ready to give full cred,t to Lord ShRftesbury and other benevolent persons who had established ragged schools. lt was quite ght to promote them come 20 years ago, when the subject of education in this country was in a transiion state;* but it was most unwise h attempt to place the ragged school system on a permanent basis. He feared that the scheme embodied in the present Bill would be one of rivalry to the existing system of eiucation,which he approved in the main, though he thought it required some modifications, and that a larger grant sbould be made from the public funds. He did not know whether it was the wish of the hon. baronet the promoter o' the Bill to compel every child throughout the country to b3 educated, with or without the consent of the parents - b ut that was a course which could not possibly be pursued in this frec country. It was quite right to endeavour to induce parents to give to their children the blessings of education, but compulsion could not be ado d ted. The parents of the children educated and maintained at these proposed industrial schools were to be compelled to reimburse the expense at the rate of 3s. a-week per head, when, perhaps, they were unwilling to pay even one penny a-week for each child educated at a superior school under the Priy Council system. The proposition was altogether preposterous, and reimbursement was utterly hopeless. If the measure should be acted on, the result would be that the working man might say he would leave this desrotic country and go to the United States or Australia. In tha% cuse, if he left his children behind the State would be obliged to provide for them, without having an opportunity to demand reimbursement.
sr. HADFIELD seconded the amendment. He said that he did not like those constant attemptS to coUect a tax for the purpose of education. To tax. other people was a very cheap mode of being charitable. He was of opinion that the advocates of compulsory education were producing evils of the most serious character, and he expressed his cnviction that great advantages were already secured in tSe matter of education by the voluntary efforts of benevolent p ople.
Mr. BAIN-ES regretted that the hon. member for Surrey opposed the principle of the Bill. Its details were no doubt open to a good deal of criticism, but, on the part of himself and also of the Government, he cordially approved its principle. (Hlear, hear.) When its machinery was altered it would prove to be a very useful measure. The objections of the hon. member for Sheffield applied to the Bill which stood next on the paper (Sir J. Pakilgton's Education Bill), rather than to that under consideration. Everybody knew that in our large towns there were many children who wandered about the streets destitute and uncared for. He had the honour of presiding over a committee which sat three years ago upon this subject, and before which it was clearly proved that there was an appalling number of destitute and criminal children in this country. He would advise the hon. member for Surrey to read the evidence given before that committee. One of the witnesses (Mr. Thompson, a magistrate of the county of Aberdeen) stated to the committee that a plan was adopted in Aberdeen in 1845 substantially the same as that contained in this Bill, and that it had produced tho most beneficial results. The same plan had been adopted with a like success in Glasgow. Mr. Ingersol, who was at that time the representative of the United States of America, informed the comimittee that there were houses of refuge in Philadelphia such as those contemplated by the hon. baronet (Sir S. Northcote.) The hon. member for Greenock had carried a Bill with regard to the class of chldren which was mentioned in the 5th section of this Bill, and he (Mr. Baines) had his authority for stating that it had been put into operation, and that the results were most satisfactory. Parliament had upon more than one occasion sanctioned the principle of this Bil. He believed that the hon. baronet was ready at the proper time to give a candid consideration to any suggestion for the improvemuent of its details, and he therefore hoped that the House would unanimously agree to its being read a second time.
Mr. BAXTER, in supporting the second reading, referred to the working of the industrial schools in Dundee and Arbroath. Dundee, he said, contained nearly 100,000 inhabitants. A few years ago it wvas impossible to walk along its streets without being importuned for ahns by juvenile beggars of both sexes and a,l ages, shivering in rags, degraded in appearance, bearing overy feature of suffering and neglect. In the year 1846 no fewer than 212 children under 14 years of age were apprehended by the police, having been gilty of cnmue; i 1847, foUowing the example of Aberdeen, a ow benevolent gentlemen in Dundee formed an industrial school; the following year IfOchildren assembled within its walls, and julvenile crime immediately began to decrease. A-t the end of l851 the superintendent of police wrote to the secretary as follows:
'The return, as you will observe, shows a most gratifying result in the diminution of juvenile delinquency as compared with former years. It wrill be eseen that the number of juvenile offenders during the past 12 months is enly as one to four compared with fhe number in 1846, heinF the year in which the fndustrial School in Dundee was mnstituted. On former oCCasiOnS, when called upon to make a return of this kind, I invariably took an opportunity of stating my conviction of the great good that had been effeeted by the institution in saving many wretched chilidren from beggary and crime, teaching them useful knowledge, and training them to habits of industry. I have much epoleabsure in; retpeaating that my opinlion remains unaltered on this subject." ~ ~ ~ t
Aind how st4od the case now ? Wy, at the close of 1&55 the number of juvenile criminals had decreased from 212 to 72, and this in a town rapidly increasing in sire ; and, what was still more remarkable, the number of scholars in the 3ntitttion had fallen off from 150 to II6, without there beingtheleastpereptibleinceaso inthe number of vgrants
on the streets, proving that this voluntary soiety had ade-
quatelymetthew antgof thepopulation. Dale stteetIn al
chool in Arbroath,atown about a fourthaslarge as Dundee, presented similar results. The only difficultyexperienced an enabling tbe managers of these institutions to meet the
wants of society was the absence of any power on the part of a nagistrate to send vagrant children to the schools. Tis power was iver n by an Act carried by his hoeL friend
themember for <iceenock. It bad been found to work well; and they were nowadked tooxteudits provisions to England. That he understood to be tho object of the hon. baronet's BNill He (M4r. Baxter) wished to imapress uapon gentlemen interested in these institutions the importance of economy. Parents or vnions might be called upon by this Bill to pay 3s. a-week for the maintnauce of a child in the schooL Some of the schools already established In England

belp thinking, therefore, that his southern friends rnight learn a leson from the north in the matter hf economy. He hoped that the Bill would be passed inte law, as. it would extend a system which promised to render brighter the future of this country by stemmhing near its fountain head the alarming stream of crime. (Hear, hear.)
Lord STANLEY thought that the principle of the Bill was thoroughly sound. and would fully accomplish the
r.aiseworthy object of the hon. baronet (Sir S. Northcote).
ould not help thiinking that part of the observationis of the hon. member for Sheffield lad been prematurely delivered, and had had more reference to the general scheme of education proposed by the right hon. baronet (Sir J. Palington) thban to the special provisions of this measure. (Hear.) Be did not think thatthe defenceOof this Billrequired comparisons between a voluntary and a State supported system of education. The hon. mnember for Sbeffield had spoken of the hardship of throwing the cost of maintainin'
these children on the public ; but he seemed to forget that lesson which we had learnt by bitter experience, tbat, with regard to vagrant criminal children, it was cheaper, to pay for prevention than for subsequent punishment. (Hear.) The hon. member for Surrey had pointed to the danger of parents being permitted by this lill to abandon their children, with the view of havingthem maintained in industrial schools. That danger certainly required serious consideration, but how stood the case ? If the parent was a resident, part of the cost of maintaining his child could be recovered from him by the operation of this Bill. If the parent was a pauper, wahy then the public would of course have, in any case, to maintain the child. If the parent belonged to the criminal class he would be more disposed to prevent h!is child from entering an industrial school
cause it was unfortumately a matter of notoriety that the children of criminal parents were employed to plunder for the support of their parents. But, said one hon. member, "This Bill wil complicate the law with regard to reformatory schools." Now, it was precisely because they had legislated on the subject of reformatory schools that a stronger reason existed for this kind of legislation. The great difliculty with regard to reformatory schools, and one which weighed much upon bis mind, was this, that the Legislature as yet seemed to give to criminal children advantages which they withheld from those who had not been convicted of crime. (Hear, hear.) This Bill
however, proposed to give to children who bad not been convicted, but who, from their circumstances, were liable to fall into crininal habits, the same advantages, but with better results, as were given to those children who had already been placed at a bar of justice. As to the objection that thia Bill might interfere with the operation of the reformatory schools, he was sorry that as yet there were not many such schools in existence. (Hear, hear.) The Reformatory School Act was a merely permissive and not a compulsory measure. He thought, then, that the House ought to encourage the worthy boronet (Sir S. Northeote) in his laudable endeavour. He should, however, object, when the House went into committee, to that clause of the Bill which would authorize the apprehension of such children as were suspected of associating with criminals and their lodgment in an industrial school, because a stigma would be cast upon the child thus apprehended and sent to an industrial school. (Hear.) With that single exception, and such modifications as might seem desirable in committee, he should be prepared to give his most cordial support to the Bill.
Mrx. GORDON contributed to the detailed statement already made by one of the previous speakers (Mr. Baxter) with regard to the salutary effects consequent upon the establishment of industrial schools in Aberdeen, and eartily wished success to the attempt of the hon. baronet to multiply the number of such schools throughout the country.
Mr. NEWDEGATE strongly objectedi to that part of the Bill which authorized the sending of any of the children taken off the streets to a reformatory school if they should be thought not fit for an industrial school.
Mr. BOWYER said that the objeot of the framers of this Bill was no doubt a useful and ial audable one, but there were so maany objections both to the principles and to the details of this mieasure that he could not consent to its second reading. The police were to have power to take into custodycall children wandering about the streets after 9 o'clook at night, and although this was guarded by Iany restrictions, yet as these children would have no one to speak for them, their parents being poor and afraid to interfere with the police, nio doubt mnany would be dealt with under this Bil whom its framers did not intend to subject to its operation. It was true that by the lith clause it was provided that the parent might, under certain conditions, have theo child sent to the school which he approved; h ut, as he maust prove that the managers of some such school were wiling to receive his child, and must give security for the payment of any expenses which might be caused by his objection to the school selected` by the magistrates, this provision wouldl in nine caes out of ten be inoperative. The practical effect of the Bill would he that large numbers of Irisbh Ioman Catholic children wouldl be sent to industrial schools where they would be unfairly poeyid. This objection would apply with increased force to ino sending of a child to a reformatory school, where it would have fixed upon it the indelible stain of having been classed by authority with the crimninal and dangerous population. Thle present mnoment was not favourable to the considerationx of such a measure. The Ministers had run their heads against the great wail of China, and had endorsed the bill of Dr. Bowring, which had on the previous night been dishonoured. As a result of this, the mnembers of that House had beern told that they were to be sent to their constituents;- and ho thought that it would be better to leave this miatter to be dealt with by the new Parliament. For thes reasons he should certainly divide the House against the Bill.
Mr. A.DDERLEY thought that if this Parliament was about to expire it was Peculiarly desirable that it should complete th; work of establishing and encouraging these schools, which it comnmenced three Years ago. The hon. member for North Warwiokshdire (Mr. Newdegate) had opposed this BUIl because he saw that it constituted vagrancy an offence, and sought to place vagrant children in industrial schools which did not exist. Both these objections were unfounded. Vagrancy was already an offence by statute, and by this Bill it was for the first time proposed that vagrant children should no longer be treated as crimiinals. Industrial schools did exist, andl the hon. mnember ought to k-now thAt.nteprnia town of the county which he repreetdteews perhaps, the beat of such schoolsintekgdm (Blear, hear.)

How many district schools were there? The Act under whichl they were formed had beena in qperation 13 years, and there were now hut eight district schoaols in existence, of wvhich three were in the mnetropolis. The reason of this was that the Act could niot be worked. Youi had to get the unanLimous consent of the hoard of guardiam, and after you had worked a whole year for that a new board was elected, and you had all the work to do over again. The best district school in the kcingdom was that establishied by Mx.Woohridge Whitmore; and the efetothsBlwod be toencourage those very exertionswhickMir.rphitmorehad made with so mnuch success. In the objections raised by the hen, miember to raggedi schools he concurred, but under thisi Bill these schools would be merged in these which were contemplated by it. It had also been said that no one would paLy 3s. a-week to send his child to one of these schools when he could send them to a national school for a penny a-week. How could the Bill act better than by induceing a parent to get into an independent position to send his child to a national school? The hon, maember for Dun. dalk (Mr. Bowyer) hadl said that the Bill wouldl have a proselytizing effect. If he read the Bill he would find that th~gets aehdbeitle to prevent this; and it was a fmcttht terewa noclas f cildenin our large towns lookd ateras hos ofRomn Cthoies Hehoped
Mr. A. BLACK bore testimony to the success of thein dustrial schools introduced into Edinburgh by Dr. G4uthrie, the effect of which had been to reduce the numnber of juxvenile delinquents to one-third of its pr-evious amount, He thought that the country was mauch indebted to the hon. baronet (Sir S. Northeote) for introducing this Bill, and pro. mnised it his miost cordial support.

Sir J. PAXINGTON declined to be drawn by what had fallen from tho hon. baronet who bad spoken last into a premature discussion of the general question of edacation. The voluntary rinciPle, of which tbo hon. baronet was so enamoure , had not prevented our great towns from swarming with thosc destitute and vagr.nt children wbose miserable position rendered necessary some legislation hke that aimed at by his hon. friend the member for Dudley. Tire hon. baronet opposite seemed prepared ti leave this flagrant evil wholly unchecked, and to allow these unfortunate children to goon swelling our criminal population until they reached the lowest depths of vice and infamy. (Hear, hear.) The Bill before the House, however, was directed to one of tie most interesting portions of the greatest social questions of the day-a question which was gradually forcing itself on public attention, and one with which Parliament must sooner or later deal. Indeed, if the Legislature had grappled with national education in irs various branches before, the present necessityforpartial measures would have been obviated. Things must, however, be taken as we found them; and, though this measure was not entirely free from objection, tbat was no reason why they should not support Ats pinciple by agreeing to the second reading. The bill as it stood woald bring under thie jurisdiction of the magistrates a class of the youth of this country who oughtrathertobethe inmates of national schools, if any cound system of national education really existed. The policy of his hon. friend, in seeking to establish three different kinds of schools, was a doubtful one. First, he proposed national schools for all untainted children; secondly, reformatory schools for our criminal population; and tbirdly, industrial schools, to be intermediate between the first two descriptions of institu-- tions. Now, it was desirable that every well-regulated school for tlre working classes should bean ndustrial school. and under a sound system of national education every girl ought to be taught to sew, and every boy trained in the elements of some useful trade. (Hear, hear.) Again, they must carefully guard against mixing up poverty and crime by any such scheme as the present. At the same time it should be remembered that this Bill avowedly dealt with a class who had contravened the laws of the land-viz, " children found begging about the street," and who were therefore committing a breach of the Vagrancy Acts. The enactments of the measure were, however, susceptible of simplification. They encroached, on the one hand, on what ought to be the province of the national education, and, on the other, pn what should be the province of the Poor Law. But undoubtedly some means should be taken to deal with the youthfal population midway between the honest poor and the convicted criminal, and who constituted what had been aptly designated "the perishing and dangerous classes." These children had not actually violated the law, but were just on the point of doing so; and, as the main object of this Bill was to snatch them in time from the vortex of ruin, he should cordially support its second reading. In this matter we were only copying the example set by our enlightened neighbours in Scotland, who, with a sagacity and a benevolence which put us im England to the blush, had taken the lead in too many of these social questions. They had been foremost in the cause of national education, in which we were too slow to follow them. They also led the way in the establishment of reformatories for the guilt; and again, by the adoption of the Act of the hon member for Greenock; (Mr. Dunlop) they had leen pioneers to us in reclaiming theneglectedintermediate class in whose behalf this Bill had been introduced. (Hear, hear.) Thanking the hon. member for Dudley moet heartily for his praiseworthyexertions on this subjecthewishedhimeverysuccess, and was sure that when the measure went into committee he would be ready to consider every suggestion that had beer made for its improvement. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. E. BALL, in supporting the second reading, denied that the operation of the measure would be oppressve and burdensome to the agricultural districts. He contended, on the contrary, that it was much cheaper to prevent crime than to punish it, and arged that by cultivating the morals of these destitute children the cost of their prosecution and their maintenance in gaol would be saved to the country.
Mr. HENLEY said, it afforded him great pleasure to be able to support the principle of this Bill. (Hear hear.) The measure ought to be regarded as a necessary supplement to the reformatory system. No doubt the reformatory system had certain defects which must be narrowly watched and vigilantly guarded against. Those defects had been ably indicated bythe noble lord the member for Rine's Lynn. The main difficulty was to prevent a temptation from being held out to parents to get their children into these institutions instead of looking after them themselves. It was a mistake to say that this Bill sanctioned the principle of an educational rate. (Hear, hear.) Had it done that, or even paved the way for such a result, it should have received his most strenuous opposition. (Hear, hear.) The measure professed to deal with a class who had made themselves amenable to the law-viz., the vagrant class; and when it went into committee he should be disposed to confine its provisions almost exclusively to that category of children. That, however, was but a point of detaiL No good objection had yet been stated to the principle of the bill. The hon. member for Devonshire (Mr. Palk) had, indeed expressed some alarm as to Its effect on the agricultural distncts. In that alarm he did not share. Tne amounts to be paid would be determined by the discretion of the magistrates after full consideration of the means of the parties, The whole of the great educational schemes proposed in that House had hitherto omitted t' deal with wlat was denominated our "Arab population." None of them had condescended to go down so low as to reach this unfortunate class; and the great merit of this
ill was that it, at all events, attempted to reach them. (Hear, hear.) If the number of this class could be in any way diminished the rest might more easily be absorbed into the national schools, which at present were totaly unable to receive them. The hon. baronet deserved great credit for his attempt to deal with this hitherto neglected class, and he wished him every success. (Hear, hear.) Whatever objections there were to the details of the Bil might easily be amended in committeo, and he should therefore give his cordial vote for its second reading.
Mir. BARROW, said he felt as strongly as any one the moral duty of sweeping the streets of this class of juvenile vagabonds, but it ought to be carried out by voluntary efforts, and not by taxing men who had already enough to do tosupport their own families. His great objection to this Bil was that it was compulsory both as to the manner in which the funds were to be raised, and also as to the withdrawing of children from parental controL (Hear.) It was contrary to all precedent that a single magistrate should have the power of taxing the ratepayers for the maintenance and education of these children, and it was even more objectionable that a single magistrate should have the power of sending to one of these establshments for an unlimited period-for there was no limit in the Bil except the age of 15
years-a child who had been guilty of no criminal offence. 'whatever. It was said that society ought not to give these children a bad character, which would stick to them for life, by sending them to prison; but what difference was there between sending them to prison and to one of these places 9 They wereto be committed, too, to the charge, not of responsible officials appointed by the State, but of any r- sons wsho might have established one of these schools. This wlas a breach of the constitution to which he could not give
hs assent. The Bill was a superfluous piece of legislation, for at present children who had commnitted any offence against the Vagrant. Laws might he sent to the reformatory
Sir S. NORTHCOTE said, his share of the merit of bringing forward this measure was exceedingly smalL Ho had only endeavonred by it to call the attention of Parliament to the efforts of other persons of much greater weight than himself, many of whose labours had already become part of the law of the land. His object had been to present the subject in such a shape to the House as would be most convenient for raising all the various questions which were involved in it. Though there was nore rinciple containedcin the Bill whichbad notalready receive the assent of Parliament, he was by no means prepared to say that every rovision of it was the best which could possibly be framed, and he should be very glad to receive and adopt, if possible, any suggestions which might be made in committee for its improvement. The hon. member for East Surrey maintained that the police had at present the power, and that it was their practice, to arrest all these young vagrants and send them to the workhouse. He doubted very muceh both the power and the practice ; but, even if the hon. mnember were right, it was imnpossible that the workhouse could accommodate them all. The Bill introduced into the other House by Lord Shaftesbury in 1853 on this subject, which was confined to the metropolis, and which provided that vagrant juveniles should be sent to the workhouse, broke down on the ground, that the workhouse could not receive them. The hon. member's next objection was that the Bill was superfluous, because there were already reformatories for the reception of these children;- hut he lost sight entirely of the fact that it was intended to mneet the ease of an intermediate class of vagrants, for whom, in some way or other, an intermediate class of establishments between the reformatories and national schools must be provided.' The national schools could not deal with them, as was abundantly shown in the reports of the school inspectors, and as for the reformatories ever chld ent her cot th pulicpurse 7s. a-week, whic wasfarmorethanthecostwoul beaccordinag to the alcuatins wichhad een edein teseindustrial

As regarded education or rather tuition, the Bill was founded on strictly voluntary prin.riples. The expense of teaching reading, writing, arithmetic, and so on, wo.id be defrasyed out of voluntary subscriptions; hut these children needed-more than thiat. They needed to be diZscinined, to have their moral perceptions awakrened, and t b taught habits of order and of labour; and to dlo that it would be mecessary to find them food and, in most eases, lodging. TheL expenses mulst he borne by the State, for it ear. tahly would be a gret temptation to parents to abandon their .children if they knew that they would be immnediately taken C,LVe of by priVAte charity. Thre State would have the power of saddling the Parents, In cases where the" ere able to pay, wit,'i wha~t proprly belonged to them-thre mainte.. niance of theier Own chilren, and, in cases where the could not pay, by th,s commzon law the child was entltlodto a maintenance Dsit of the poor-rates ; Eo that, in. fact, no additional expenise was caused to the public by these3 instiftu.icns, Cowpplivqnts ha been made the. this Bill
infringed on the liberty of the sabject, but this was not the first by rery many cases in which the law infringed on the
hiberty of the subject where there was reason to apprehend i that harm would ensue without interference. On the whole, he was very well satisfied with the discussion which had taken place, xnd he had every confidence that it would do
much to advanc3 the object which he had so much at 1 heart.
hir. DiNLOP expressed his gratitude for the manner in which his efforts in connexion with the Industrial Schools Act had been spoken of. The sbare which he had taken in promoting the establishment of those schools in Scotland wonld be the act to which he should look back with moss
pleasure in his Parliamentary career. I
Mr. LIDDELL observed that the almost unanimous feeling of the House seemed to be in favour of the principle of the Bil, and he thought the objections to its details m,ight be most conveniently considered in committee. It was, in his opinion, most important that they should avoid affording any ground for the idea that the plan was proposed with the slightest view to proselytism.
Mr. FORTESCUE would support the second reading of the Bill, reserving to himself the right of proposing any alterations in committee which he thonzht necemssry to remove the slightest imputation of proselitizing intentions.
Mr. Serjeant SEIEE would like the Billa great deal better if it frankly proposed that the schools to be established should be Church of England schools. There could not be the least doubt that most of them would be Church of England schools, and so he thought they onght to be, because the majority of ratepayers in this oountry, or at all events those who paid the largest amount of rates, were members of. that churcb. If the children received into these schools were not instructed in religion they would leave the schools in a worst state than when they entered them, and he wouid much rather that they should be taught the religion of theChurch of England than that they should receive mo religios instruction at all (Hear, hear.) If it was declared that the religion of the Church of England should be taught in the schools arrangements riDht be made by other religious bodies for affording instrn'ction to the children of persons professing their respective creeds.
Mr. WARNER apprehended, under the provisions of the Bill, that it wvould be competent to persons of any religious denomination to establish schools of this description.
Mr. AlCOCK withdrew his amendment, and the Bill was read a second time.
EDUCATION (CITIES AND BOROUGHS) BILL
On the order of the day for the second reading of this Bill
Mr. COBDEN asked whether at that late hour (4o'clock) the right hon. member for Droitwich thought it Advisable to press the Bill ?
Sir J. PAXINGTON said, he had fully intended proceeding with the Bill that day, bat under a11 the circumstances of the present time he thought it was not desirable that he should now move the second reading.
Mr. HADFIELD presented petitions against the Bill from Manchester, from an association in London, and two from Sheffield. The hon. member moved that three of the petitions be read by the clerk at the table.
The clerk accordingly read the petition from Manchester
which was of some length. He Was proceeding to read ; second petition when
Mr. ADDERLEY rose and asked the Speaker whether it was competent to a member to move that any number of petitions he might present should be read at the table l (Hear, hear.)
The SPEAER replied that, according to the standing orders, there could be no doubt any member presenting a petition might, if he desired it, have it read by the clerk at the table. It was of course left to the discretion of hon. members whether they thought it right to occupy the attention of the House in such a manner. (Laughter.) If hon members were to insist upon the right of having the petitions they presented read at the table, unless those petitions relatea to very exciting or important questions, the whole time of the House might be occupied m listening to them. (Renewed laughter.)
Mr. HADFIELD had made the proposal because he was anxious that the House should hear the sentiments of the petitioners.
The SPEAKER.-Does the hon. member wish the clerk to read any more petitions ?
Mr. HADFIELD. -Oh, no. (Laughter.)
Mr. MIALL presented a petition from the Baptist Union. of Great Britain and Ireland against the Bill.
Slr J. PAXI GTON, in moving the postponement of the order to Wednesday next, said that copies of some of the petitions against the Bill had been forwarded to him, and he thought that he would be able to show that they were not entitled to the weight which was attached to them by some hon. gentlemen.
Mr. HADFIELD observed that there was a very strong feeling in the country against the measure, which was con sidered to involve such an affront to the religious sentiments of the community as had not been offered in modern times.
In reply to Mr. HENLxy,
Sir J. PAKNGTON said, he could not state positively whether he would proceed with the Bil next Wednesday or not, but he would give fair notice of the time at which it would be brought before the House.
The motion for the postponement of the order to Wednesday, March U, was then agreed to.
COURT OF CHANCERY, IRELAND (TITLES OF
PURCHASERS) BILL.
&r. WRITESIDE, in moving the second reading of this Bill, said, its objec' was to secure the title of purchasers of estates under judiial sales of the Court of Chancery in Ireland. Parliament had established the principle of confirming the title to estates sold under the Encber Estates Court in that country. A Bill had been introduced in 1853 with the object of engrafting the same princple upon the Court of Chancery in Ireland, but it was oplosed by the Government. Subsequently the subect was inquired into by a commission composed of very eminent persons, who reported their opiion that an indefeasible title should be given under judical sales in the Court of Chncery. At present the Court had power to decree land tobesold and conveyed, but had not the power to give what was caUed a Parliamentary title. Many estates were sold in the Court of Chancery which could not be sold in the Encumbered Estates Court, and he did not see on what principle tbey could refuse to a Court which had the authonty to decree a sale the power of affording a purchaser the same indefeasible title which was given nuder the Encumbered Estates Act. He hoped, therefore, the House would read the Bill a second time.
Mr. J. D. FITZGERALD opposed the Bill, on the ground that it was calculated to undermine one of the most beneficial institutions which that House had ever conferred upon Ireland. Six or seven yea-s ago the Encumbered Estates Court was established in that country, and had worked wel. The hon. and learned gentleman (Mr. WVhiteside) had, he believed, never been friendly to the system then established. That hon. member proposed in 1863 to confer certain powers of this nature upon the Court of Chanoery in Ireland but they were powers very far short of those possessed by the Encnmberea Estates Court. He (Mr. Fitzgerald) thought they might dispense with the Encumbered Etates Court - but great caution would be required in determining to what tribunal the authority of sellngenenmbered and unencumbered estates should be committed, and in his opinion the Court of Chancery ought not to be intrasted with that power unti it had been completely reformed. By the ACt of last session the Court of Chanoery in Ireland had no th.e power to reform itself. [Mr. Whiteside.- Which it nas never done.] The Act had only been in operation two months, so that there had not yet been time to carry out the reforms which the court had obtained the power to make. It remained to be seen whether the Court of Chancery would exercise that power; and if it did not reform itself, then it would be the duty of Parliament to do it. The proposition of the hon. and learned member for Enniskillen was to take from the Encumbered Estates Court the largest portion of its business-that which aroseon the petition of encumbrancers-and give it to the Court of Chancery. He opposed that proposition. The Bill of his hon. friend would perpetuate the Masters in Chancery, whose continuancehad been almost universally condemned; and it would devolve the responsibility of the judge in very important matters on some conveyancing counseL He would not divide the House on the second reading of the Bil, ashe was unwillingto doso in existingeircumstances, but if his hon. and learned friend proceeded with the measure he would oppose it on the next stage.
Mr. G. BUTTJ supported 'the BiU as a benefcial piece of legislation, and contended that, should the Court of Chancery in L-eland reform itself, those reforms could be grafted upon it.
* Mr. MACARTNEY supported the Bill. Pending the reform of the Court of (:hancery, he wished to see that court possessed of the power of giving a Parliamentary title.
Sir E. PERRY objected to the Bill being read a second time now, as it might preclude the discussion hereafter of the important questions which had ist year been under the consideration of the committee. He moved that the Bill be read a second time that day six months.
Mr. WHITESIDE hoped that the hon. and learned member for Devonport would not press his motion. The discussion on the principle of the Bill might be resumed at a futare stage.
Mr. J. D. FITZGERALD also trmted that no further opposition would be given to the second reading of the Bill. He would take care, on some other occasion, to afford the hon. and leamed member for Devonport an opportunity of recording his vote against the measure.
Mete. . t IThGe ,and thougl t they ber o greatly indebted to the hoA. and learned metuber for Enniskrgen for
ir:roducing this BilL It was absolutely necessary that E;necourt in Ireland should have the power of giving an indefeasibletitle to unencumbered property. There were some portions of the Bill which m ight be amended; but in so far as it would enable unencumbered property to be bought and sold with the same facility as encumbered estates he thought it was deserving the support of the House.
Sir B. PERRY then witdrew his anmendment, and the Bill was read a second time.
FOREIGN MIITARY EDUCATION.
A motion by Mr. 3 ACAsTxE y (in the absence of Colonel Dunne) for a copy of the report on foreip military educa. tion drawn up by a commission appointed by the Secretary of State for Wr was agreed to.

The deaths in London have exhibited a slow but constaut decrease during the four weeks of February. ID tho week that ended last Saturday the total number registered wa
1,216. In tho ten years 1847-46 the average numter of ecaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,1U8. But the deaths now returned occurred in an increasod population, and for comparison with tho averago tho ltter should be raised proportionately to the increase, in which case it vill become 1,2fi3. The resalt of tho comparison is a difference of 47, showing that the rate of mortatity last week was ratber below the average.
Tho 7.ymotic class of diseases was fatal last wvoek in 197 cases; the corrected average is 243. These figuros indicato a very favourable condition of hoalth, especially among young persons, who aro chiefly liablo to many of the diseases included under this head. Hooping-cough is still the most fatal of tbo zymotic complaints, but it shows a decrease on previous returit% the weelzly deaths from it in Februaryhaving been 61, 70, 74, and 53. Of 45 deaths from typhus and commnon fever only 6 occurred in tbo southern districts, although in the five divisions of tho metropolis the south contains the largest population. Tho central districts a1soappear to have been comparatively free from fever, onedeath in that division having been from scarlatina, and 4 from typhus. A vomran died in Longs,-court, ia the Charing-crors sub-district, from cholera, after 48 hours' ill-
-ess. Mr. Leonard, who attended her daring tho latter stage of the disease, states that it bore a close roeemblan-,& to the Asiatic type.
The deaths from pulmonary diseases were last week 304
whilo the corrected average of corresponding woeks is 2'6. The excess is not vcry considerablo, and arises from bron. chitis, which was fatal in 166 cases (the averago being 134), a numbor greater by 75 than that referrod to pneumonia. Fhthisis, which stands in tho tubercular c! carried off 142 persons. Two persons diod of carbuncle ; three of iatemperanoo; a boy, 9 years of age, diod under chloroform administered with a view to an operation. Only two aonagenarians, both widows, and the oldest 91 years of age,. are recorded in the returns.
Last week the births of 925 boys and 896 girls, in all 1,821 children, were registered in London. in the ten corresponding weeks of the years l847-4 the average number was 1,631.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, thec mean height. of the barometer in the week was 30-214 inches. The mean. reading was above 30 inches on every day from Wednesday, the 18th ult., to the end of the month. The barometer ro,eso high as 30-40 inches on Saturday. The saean tempera. ture of the week was 41-2 deg., and was 19 deg. above tho average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Ir. Glaisher). The highest temperature occurred on Saturday, and was 5639 deg. ; the lowest oocurred on Wednesday, and was 249 deg. The range of the week was 32deg. The meat dew-point temperature was 36-9 deg., and tho differ. ence between this and the mean teinperature of the air wa% 4-3 deg. The air was frequently calm; tho wind was very variable; at the beginning and end of the week it was in the soath-west. There was no rain, except a little, not meascr. able by the gauge, on Wednesday.
The Central American Treaties.
TITE OEZgTRAL AAfERlIqA TBEATIE&
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Great confusion seems to exist in the mind of a considerable portion of the public in respect to the recently, conclnded Central American treaties, the conventions vith Honduras being confounded with the treaty with the United States. Similar confusion existed in the mind of Lord Derby, as evinced in his remarks on the Queen's Speec. until he was set right by Lord Clarendon, who said *-
" Your lordships will fnd that all the engagements whiclz we are bonnd to maintain wll be maintained, while all therights which Honduras possesses will be secured to that State. Tho two treaties are in no way connected with each other. That with the United States merely has reference to the dispute with respect to the protection of the lfos-
'ito Territory. Ruatan, whilh vwas supposed to belong toor,duras, we have made over to uat State for th. purpose of increasing the facilities for the construction of a railroad, which, I believe, will be the best mode of establishing a communication between the two oceans. On both sides of the Isthmus there arc two magnificent harbours, and, no doubt, all the Powers who would avail themselves of this communication vwould have taken exception to any arrangement by which in island almost at the entrance to it should have been left in the hands of any one Power. It has been placed under the suzerainty of Honduras, without her having the power to give it up to any other Govemment. I beheve, therefore, that. these treaties will be found fully to answer the purposes which the Governments of England and tho United States had in view, and that they wiJl prevent any future misunderstandings on this question. I will only add on this point, that I agree with the noble earl opposite that we have no interest in Central America beyond that oE possessing a free transit across the Isthmus, and I cannot see any reason why upon that question there shouldin futuroa arise any difficulty between us and the United States."
The clause " relating to slavery," which many suppose to bo one of the objections urged by tho Senato of tho United States against the Clarendon-DaUas Treaty, forns no part of that document, and is in no way legitimately before that body for consideration. It constitutes part of a convention with Honduras, and is altogether a matter between that sovereign Republic and Her Majesty's Government, and is as follows
" The republic also engages not to erect nor permit to be erected any fortification on the said islands, or any other islands in the Bay of Honduras, nor to code such islands, or any of them, or the right of sovereignty over such islands,. or any part of such sovereigTnty, to any nation or Stato whatever.
" And whereas slavery has not existed in the said islandi, the Republic of HIonduras hereby engages that slavery shbai not any time horeafter be permitted to exist therein."
The most that can be said against this clause is, that it' introduction -was unnecesaary, sinceo slavery does not exist in Hondaras, and there is not the slighest probability of its introduction. It may be questioned how far it was noco.- sary or politic to introduce the clause, and thus ronse projadices which otherwiso would have lain dormant. On the other hand, tho right and competenco of Honduras and Great Britain to treat on this or any other matter, as bet-ween themselves, is undoubted; nor is their action a subject for revision or review by the Senato of the United States. The slavery propagandists in that body will pro' bably find work enongh to do to keep similar clauses from being introduced in the constitutions of all new States which may hereafter apply for admission into tho Union, without extending their parental care to tho rolations whioh m,y be established between foreign and independent Governments.
The English public may be sure of ono thing, that no opposition to the Central American adjustment in tho United States will gain any strength in the Senato or before the countryj by calling up the " slavery issue" in connexiocx with it; and that if the Clarendon-Dallas Treaty fails it will bo upon other and more tenable grounds than this clauso in the Honduras Conventioni

THE UNITED STATES.
(ISOM OU ONVN 0ORRXsPONDMqT. I
NEW YORK, FEB. 18.
Another stage in the process of creating a President has been completed at Washington. It is the last form preliminary to the inauguration, which
takes place on the 4th of March. On the 11th inst., the Senate and House of Representatives met as a joint convention in the hall of the latter body to count the votes given by the several electoral
nolleges in December last for the President and Vice- e President of the United States. The votes, duly Eigned and sealed, were transmitted to Washington -early in the month of January. The procesi of opening and counting them is very simple; the Senators and Representatives meet as one assembly, and tellers are appointed, who read the certificate and de<clare the vote given by each State. Thus the proceedings are merely formaL But on the present occasion 4some lively discussion arose out of a nice legal point which, though not of the slightest practical import. ance as far as this election is concerned, may, it is thought, in some possible contingency affect a return, and has therefore to be settled by some decision. The constitution fixes the 3d of December as the day on which the colleges of every State shall meet and make the election; but the elements cannot be bound by clauses and sections -of any enactment, and a heavy snowstorm prevented the members of the electoral college -of the State of Wisconsin from assembling on the legal 3d of the month. Neither of the four ,electors _o compose the Wisconsin CoUege arrived at the pflre of meeting till the day following that fixed by law; and then, on the illegal 4th, it came -together and completed its task. Hence arises the -doubt-is the ?ivote of Wisconsin valid? And an-other doubt, more dreadful than the first, growing -out of it-is not the whole election vitiated by the failure of that single State to comply with the provision of the constitution on the legally appointed -day? Supposing the votes of the States equaly -divided between two candidates, and the issue depending on the vote of a single State, say Wisconsin, and that is given on the wrong daycould it be received as turning the scale? The question was not decided. When the vote of Wisconsin was read an objection to receiving it was made; but Senator Mason, the presiding 'officer of the joint convention of the Senate and Representatives, declared they had only to receive the votes and announce them. The count was then re-sumnedandcompleted. The tellers reported that all the returns were regular and the votes cast on the proper day, with the one exception stated; and the Chairman, ignoring that exception, declared Mr. James Buchanan and Mr. Breckenridge duly elected President and Vice-President of the United States for the term-prescribed by the constitution, commencing on the 4th of March next. The final official ntatement of the number of votes is :-For Buchanan, 174; Fremont, 114; Fillmore, 8.
An animated discussion ensued as to whether the vote of Wisconsin, so liable to challenge, ought to be received at all, several members of the convention, Senators and Representatives opposing it, as it -wotld be a bad precedent; permitting the day of -election to be changed might admit great abuses hereafter. Bnt the Chairman overruled aU dis-cussion on the point, the constitution authorized -the joint convention to do nothing beyond counting the votes and declaring them, the tellers had done their duty, he had done his, and there was nothing -more before them. There was considerable confusion, and half a dozen members rose to speak -together, so the Senate cut short the discussion by rising and, with their Chairman at their head, leaving the hall for their own house. One repre-entative, with a grand idea of the power of the popular branch, proposed to send the Sergeant-at-Arms after the Senate to bring it back, but this bold suggestion was not acted on. After the Senate retired the debate was continued by the Lower House, but without any definite result. On arriving again within their own precincts the Senate also renewed the discussion, but adjourned, leaving the point undecided. The question was revived on the foUowing day (the 12th) by the submission of a resolution in both Houses to the effect that the -vote of Wisconsin, not having been taken on the day fixed by law, ought not to have been <-ounted ; but in the Senate the resolution was lost, and in the Lower House was declared by the Speaker to be out of order. The point, therefore, ;remains to be decided if the difficulty should ever occur again. It requires a century at least to furnish a respectable book of precedents, and the past affords little guidance in the matter. In 1821 something of the kind occurred with the vote of 'Missouri on the re-election to the Presidency of Mr. Monroe. It was doubted whether Missouri was ¶egally a State or not when the 'rote was given, and it was counted both ways, including the doubtful vote and omitting it. In both cases Mr. Monroe was declared duly elected. In this instance the vote has been received, leaving the doubt of its legality undetermined. A joint committee of both Houses haa been appointed to inform Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Breckenridge of their election, those gentlemen being supposed to be still (officially) ignorant of -the good fortune that has befallen them.
The Senate has again discussed the Dallas-Claren-don Treaty. It had been referred back to the Comsnittee on Foreign Relations on amendment, and the committee had adopted some modifications suggested by Mr. Marcy. Had they been accepted by the Senate it is presumed they would have been sent in the form of further instructions to the American Minister in London, to be submitted to the British Government. But the hostility of the -dominant party in the Senate is not to be appeased by mere amendments; its opposition to the treaty goes deeper, and denounces the principle 'of the whole arrangement, refusing to recognize any convention that binds the United States in anything affecting the future destiny of Central America. The stipulation of the English treaty with Honduras that slavery is to remain prohibited in that State is especially obnoxious. Slavery has grown from the tolerated evil of the early days of the Republic to be a sacred institution; political patriotism has gone over to it; the power of the Democratic party is based upon and in close alliance with it. If American Senators run the risk of -assassination for denouncing it, it is useless to expect that a treaty with another Power "limiting its area" will be accepted. The result of the second
discussion is, that the treaty is taken altogether out -of the hands of the present Administration. It is held over tiU the 5th of March, and all future official action upon it will proceed from the Cabinet of Mr. Buchanan. That he is hostile to it is well known; the work of arrangement has all to be done over .again.
The prospects of the Atlantic Telegraph Company, in reference to the assistance it expected from the American Goverment, have become doubtful. When the aid to be given was embodied in the -clauses of a Bill objections arose. It was thought unjust to bind the United States, who wiU have comparatively so little business to transact with it, to givy for 25 years the same subsidy as the British GovFrnment, which has so many colonies and governors on this side the ocean. Any present help in laying down the cable and a fair payment for all messages sent by it afterwards will be freely granted; but more than this seemed in excess of
-what the equity of the case required. The BiU i3 lost for this session, as it has been referred back to -the Committee on Post-offices. The only chance for it is, tht it may be rushed through in the get
scramble of legislation expected on the night of the ed of March.
The committee of inquiry into the charges of bribery and corruption among certain members of the Legislature has closed its labours, and the report is ready for publication; but it has been deferred for a day or two. It is stated that it will recommend the expulsion of three or four representatives against wvhom direct proof of having sold their votes and iniluence has been obtained. And, as a reward for bringing these malpractices under public notice, the correspondent of the New York Times, having been kept in custody three weeks, is to be deprived of the privilege of admission to the body of the House.
It has been announced here that Mexico has obtained from the United States a loan of $15,000,000, the security for which is a grant to the United States of 15 per cent. of the Mexican Customs' duties. $3,000,000 of the loan are to be retained in liquidation of unsettled American claims. Some of the present restrictions on commercial intercourse are to be removed by the Mexican Government, and a new postal treaty will be negotiated between the two countries.
Letters received from Cuba yesterday state that Dr. Kane, the Arctic explorer, was so ill that there were no hopes of his recovery.
The Irish labourers employed, on the. Erie Railroad tunnel works, near Jersey city, have this week indulged in a more than usually fierce faction fight -Munster against Connaught. Between 400 and 500 men and women were engaged in it, and it wai was not stopped till the Jersey Militia -turned out and made a large number of prisoners; somn shanties were burnt down, and the Court-house at Jersey is now full of wounded. The old hatred broke out under the influence of pay-day and the whisky shops; but no reliable evidence has been obtained of the immediate cause of the fight.
A person named Edward David, charged with being an accomplice of Carpentier, Grelet, and Balot in the French Railway fraud, has been arrested. He has been concealed in New York for some months. It is believed that a writ authorizing the delivery of the prisoners to the French authorities will be granted in a few days.
The last mail from California brings no news of importance. The Governor of the State, in his anu nual message, denounces repudiation, and recommends the assumption and payment of the illegally contracted public debt.
The coroner's inquest in the ease of the Bondstreet assassination has closed, having been carried through 14 days. The woman Cunningham, the tenant of Dr. Burdell's house, who claims to be his widow, and Eckel the lodger are committed for trial on the charge of murder, and the second lodger, Snodgrass, as an accessory to the crime. The mass of evidence taken is enormous; the case is now being examined by the grand jury, and it is reported that some additional evidence, kept back from the inquest by parties who declined to be treated as criminals because they could throw some light on the mystery, has been obtained. The coroner still holds some of the witnesses under lock and key; in fact, the treatment of some of the witnesses has been rather Russian, and calculated to teach an indigent person the wisdom of being a Know-nothing with regard to any evidence he may be able to give. Though the testimony creates a strong case of suspicion against the inmates of the house, there is very little direct proof of their having committed the deed. Their motive is established, but not the act. The audacity of the plot, the personation of the victim in a false marriage, and the skill with which the scheme was carried out for months up to the catastrophe have invested this murder with an interest not exceeded by that of any case in the fearful volumes of Feuerbach and Pitaval. The victim at last seemed to feel there was a net thrown round him, and he made some struggles against the influence. He perceived he was watched by day and night, and it is proved that his keys were taken, his papers searched, and some of them abstracted. In the last week of his life he expressed to a friend the terror in wllich he stood of the woman, and on the day of the murder asked him to stay that night at his rooms, as if he had a presentiment of his fate. On the day following he was to have executed a lease of the house to other parties, having procured from his tenant (and intended widow) a written agreement to give it up in May. To prevent the execution of this lease it is now supposed the murder was hastened. Thus the case stands at present, with more prospect of an acquittal of the parties than their conviction. It has, however, already had one good result. It has shown that the law and practice of the State of New York in regard to the celebration of marriage are open to great abuse, and a Bill has been introduced into the State Li gislature to regulate them. At present the system is very lax; clergymen marry, any magistrate marries, an alderman of the city can marry, and they all marry any persons applying to them without notice or inquiry. The parties are not required to sign any register; a certificate is filUed up with any names given, the fee is paid, and there is an end of the matter. Under such a system the bold fraud of personating anybody and procuring a certificate in his name, as in the Burdell case, is easy; had the double of Dr. Burdell been required to sign the name himself he might have hesitated at leaving behind a direct proof of forgery. Rad the victim been quietly buried the certificate of the pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church would have been perfectly valid as proof of a marriage against the next of kin of the deceased man; and on the knowledge of this fact the assassination appears to have been planned.
The occasional revelations of the state of things in the domains of law and police are startling; but the lessons are wholesome. Incidents are not uncommon that seem to belong to another age. This case recalls old London and the abuses of the notorious " Fleet marriages ;" and now and then we got glimpses of a police system too much resembling that which produced a Jonathan Wild. The community seems to have grown so rapidly that the mechanism of social life has been left unimproved. Allowing for some inevitable differences, and such modern things as gas and telegraphs, New York seems to be in something the same condition as the English metropolis in the last cen-
tury, or even later, extending and increasing daily, badly regulated, with an inefficient police, but gradualy gaining a sense of the necessity of a tighter hand and a firmer discipline. Instead of wondering at the prevalence of crime in New York, considering the opportunities of committing it and its chances of escape afterwards, it is a marvel there is not much more. Society prospers on this enormous continent under evils which in a more circumscribed territory would peril its very existence. There is the boundless interior for the unsettled, California for the adventiurous, and Nicaragua to expend the dissipated rascality of the seaboard cities by yellow fever at the rate of 300 a month. With a wide level of wealth and comfort, and many outlets for the enterprising, the unsettled, and even the desperate, society bears up well under abuses the mere specification of which is calculated to make older communities stand aghast.
Mr. Peabody, the London banker, has given the city of Baltimore $300,000 f or the establishment of an institution which is to include a free library, a musical academy, and a picture gallery. The gift is hereafter to be inereased to $500,000. Mr. Peabody descends on the American towns and cities in showers of gold.

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MOKZY-MABKBJTand CITYINTELLIGEN C.
Wednedy Evening.
The announcement of the defeat of the Government on the Chinese question was received this morning with universal surprise and almost with universal regret and dissatisfaction. Scarcely on any political point within modem experience has the feeling of the commercial community been expressed with such general unanimity. The English funds, which left off yesterday with a buoyant appearance, o°ened at a decline of a quarter per cent., and subsequently experienced a further depression, from which there was no recovery. Bat for the intelligence of the treaty of peace having been signed with Persia, coupled with a more easy state of the money-market, the adverse movement would apparently have been greater. Consols, which closed last evening at 93~ to 94, were first quoted 93e to i, and the final transactions were at 93i to ,s for money, and 941 to j for the 8th of April. Bank Stock left off at 220 to 222; Reduced, 931 to i ; New Three per Cents., 94 to i; India Stock, 221 to 223; India Bouds, 4s. discount to par; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to i; and Exchequer-bills (June), IA. discount to 2s. premium.
This being the 4th of March the payments falling due were exceedingly heavy, but they were wel met in all quarters, and in the discount-market there was a tendency to relaxation.
Foreign securities were heavy, and prices generally experienced a reaction. More steadiness, however, was apparent towards the close. The principal business was in Turk-ish and Mexican. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated for money at 97i, and fot the account at 97k, i, 97, 96k, and 97i. Operations took place in the Four per Cents. Guaranteed at 101# and i; Mexican was dealt in at 22k, i, 2 , x , and i for the account. The general transacthions comprised-Buenos Ayres, 84k; Peruivian Four-a4d-a-Half per Cents., 79k; Russian Five per Cents., 107A ; Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 40-i; and the Certificates, 6g and J.
The corn-market this morning was without alteration.
The Paris Bourse opened with firmness this morning, but experienced a reaction in consequence of the vote last night in the House of Commons. The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. were 70f. S0c. for money and 71f. 20c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of a quarter per cent.
The total brought by the Orinoco to-day from the West Indies and Mexico is 195,0001. Her Majesty's ship Trincomalee, although due at Panama since the middle of January, with specie from the Mexican coast, had not arrived when the Orinoco sailed.
Intelligence has been received of the concession of the National Bank of Turkey to the London capitalists, mentioned on the 14th of January last, having been ratified. The precise details of the conditions finally adopted have not transpired, but they are believed to be of the solid and favourable character already described. The Bank, it is said, are to be alowed a maximum note circulation of 15,000,0001. on condition of a reserve being held o' one-third in gold. The withdrawal of the existing currency is to be effected gradually. That portion of the paper which bears interest (about 2,000,0001.) is to be first redeemed, and 18 months ara to be allowed for calling in the residue. For the amount of this operation the Bank- are to receive Government bonds bearing 6 per cent. interest secured on some of the leading branches of revenue. They are to have the Government account, and their capital is to be 10,000,0001. ; but it is estimated that only QUffourth wil be called up at the commencement. With regard to management, it is understood that the proceedings are to be carried on in entire conformity with the judgment of a London board.
The advices from Mexico by the West India mail to-day throw no additional light on the rnmoured intention of the American Government to grant a loan of 3,000,0001. or 5,000,0001. to that republic. According to some representations a portion of any sum that may be received is to be applied to the claims of the English bondholders, but this statement is perhaps circulated merely to lull their vigilance and prevent opposition. The movements of the clerical party against the Government continued, and as President Comonfort is endeavouring to pursue a middle couirse, his tenure of power is extremely precarious. M. Sorela, the Spanish Charg6 d' Affaires, had finaUy broken off aU relations with the country, and had sailed for Havannah, where the greatest excitement prevailed from the expectation that a fleet would be immediately despatched thence to commence hostilities. The outrages lately committed by the followers of Alivarez against the Spanish residents in Mexico and the alleged desire of the Government to screen the offenders are described to have been the proximate causes of this step; but there were previously some angry questions pending, and it is believed that the Mdadrid Cabinet, acting under inspirations from Rome, have for some time past determined to interfere forcibly to promote the re-establishment of a reactionary Govermnent. Meanwhile, although the improbable report brought by the last mail of a new outbreak having occurred at Puebla has been shown to be erroneous, the country was suffering from serious disturbances in other districts. At San Luis the insurgents and Government forces remained in sight of each other without either side apparently being willing to risk an attack, and at Tepic disturbances had broken out which threatened to increase the general embarrassment. In connexion with the San Luis movement the British Chargd d'Affaires had found it necessary to make representations, which had thus far been unsatisfactorily met. The revolutionists at that place on the 1st of January broke into the residence of the British Consul, and aossessed themselves of 48,0001. in silver deposit there for safety by its owners. The reply of the Mexican Government to the claim for restitution instead of being a prompt and unequivocal recogmtion of liability, was merely to the effect that they would place an embargo on the property of the chief, M. Samamego, by whose instructions the robbery had been committed. The English Government will therefore receive a despatch from their Minister by this packet, asking to be allowed to insist on the repayment -within a specified time of the sum stolen, with compensation for all damages. At the present moment, however, there seems little encouragement to defend the interests of our merchants in foreign countries.
The following is from the Committee of Mexican Bondholders:-
" The committee have received advices from Mr. Whitehead, dated the 1st it., transmitting a decree signed by the President on the 23d, and published in the official Gazeuc of Mexico on the 29th of January, which embodies an agreement negotiated by Mr. Whitehead with the late Minister of Finance, Senor Lerdo, for carrying into effect the third article of the decree of the 14th of October, 1850. The committee have also received this decree officially througgh the hands of the Mexican financial agency here. & transla. tion of it will he sent to-morrow. It is verv valuable as a distinct recognition of the port agents of the bondholders in Mexico as collectors and receivers of the revenues assed for the payment of interest on the debt, and islikely to result in greater security for the future. But, though the new decree came into force on the day of itz- publication, it wil practiciuy remain Inoperative for some time yet as regards n increase of remittances, because the Mexican Government has enncmbered the revenures fom the Custo2msbyoorders and anticipations to the amount of some
"There was a rumour that the Mexican Government would
rec efrom j othat ofihoe U nitoed Sotoatesa pecuniary supply of fom $0,00,000to 15,00,00, whch he publihc connected with some alleged arrangement aboout the Tehuantepee route.
"The packet brings no remittance for the dividend fund, but $,8,000 have been sent by the agents at Mazatlan by Her Mlajesty's ship Trincomalee to Panama.
" San Luis de Potosi had been evacuated by the insurgents, hut Tampico continued to refuse admission to tho governor appointed by Government, and the Spxnish Legation had eft Mexico in consequence of the alleged inactivity of the Government in brinkging to justice the murdlerers of the Spanards near Cuernavaca.

"The United Mexican Mining Association have received further and important advices from Mexico by the Orinoco, T brapo date Guapnaxuato, the 26th and 29th of January.

The frente of San Pantaleon, 223 varas below the level of the surface or mouth of the shaft, and 40 varas advanced to the north of it, is in good fruits ; the width of ore in the vein at this point is not less than three varas and the work reaches six varas in height. the ore being disseminated throughout, and of very good appearance. The level of San Maximo, 12 varas below chat
of San Pantaleon, and 16 varAs further advanced in the

'with to be made to prove the practicability of the, line being completed for ],200,0001., for which purpose a sum of 12,0001. has been voted. The colonial
Government are also to have the privilege of taking e shares in the company to the amount of 50,000L, to i enable them to nominate a director in addition to i the official director. They are likewise to be allowed to take one-half of any capital beyond 800,000l. which may be raised, and on which the lower guarantee of 5 per cent. will be payable, the guarantee on the 800,0001. being 6 per cent. 8,000L is to be granted to the company for sums expended before the present agreement was made.
It is stated from Flushing that the whole of the silver and a quantity of other valuable property have been recovered from the steamer Ravenabourne, lately sunk at the entrance to that harbour.

Passports At Paris.
PASSPORTS AT PABIS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIIS Sir,-I noticed in 27he Times of to-day a letter from "Vagabundus," alluding to an imposition practised at malta by the French authorities relative to passports.
Now, if you consider the matter worthy of insertion, I can mention what may be reaUy called a " dodge," pA.c tised not so far off as MIalta, but at Paris; and byw whch you may be fleeced of 10f. instead of 5f.
On taking my passport to the Pr6fecture de Police, a few
months simce, for the purpose of getting it signed, after the F needful had been done at the British Ambassador's, I handed I it over to the clerk, who, after the usual ceremony, gave it baCk to me, telling me that 1 must go the Foreign-office to get the risi of the Foreign Minister I said that I thought there must be some mistake, as I had never had to do so before. The official, however, assured me that now it must be done in order that the passport be parfaittment cn r-igle. As I thought it would be but a little walk, I went to the Foreign-offlce, and delivered the passport to the proper person, to whom I observed that, instead of relieving us from inconvenience with respect to passports, they were increasig it by giving us the additional trouble of coming
there. The reply he made was, that it was quite usuail F I said I never was there for such a purpose. He ssked me if I bad ever been before in Paris; if so, I must have been there. I replied I had been to Paris 18 times, but never was at that office before. Ho merely shrmgged his sboulders, returned me the passport, and, as I was about to depart with it, quietly said "Dix francs, M3onsieur." This added fnel to the fire. I little thought I should have to pay anything in addition to the trouble. However, it was of no avail muttering anythiDg about " imposition," &c., I therefore paid the money and left the office. On examining the passport afterwvards I could not find any
"appreciable iference."
I mentioned these circumstances, on the way to Boulogne, to some fellow-travellers, and learnt that they had been requested to pursue the same course as I did, but that they had taen no heed of such order, and when we arrived at ortlogne I sawv them go on board the vessel for London without any more dificulty than IE myself experienced. One French gentleman, to whom I mentioned this matter at Bonlogne, laughed outright at the idea of my pa3ing any a-tention to this " trick."
Yonr travelling readers will from this, I hope, know how to act when attacked with this mode of "obtaining money under false pretences." And, by the way, let them, for their general guidance, remember that France is now now, .par czclienct, the polite and complaisant nation that it was 30 years since.

Railway And Mining Shares.
RAILWAY AND MINING SHABRES.
Wednesday Evoulag.
The railwayrniarket experienced a reaction thLis morning, and sales caused a decline in several cases rangimg from 15s. to 25s. per share. Indian were Eteady, but French and colonial were rather lower. In some quiarters it is believed that the arrangement between the Central of France and the Orleans is completed, bywhich the line becomes the property of thelatter company, theygiving2 13 Obligationafor each share. There was a heavy tendency in the other departments, but quotations were less weak in the later hours. Bank-, land, and mining shares showed diminished buoyancy, with the exception of Canada Land, which were negotiated at 144 and 145, and closed 145 to 150. Riga Railway shares left off at the improved price of 2 to; Punjab, i to pm.; and Northern of Bengal, par to i pn.

Daring Escape And Savage Resistance Of A
DARLNo ESCAPE AND SAVAGE REslv.sTAwCF OF A TsisF..-A stalwart, well-dressed young fellow, who gavo his name as Thomas Wright, was brought Up before tho county magistrates sitting at Bath on Tuesday, charged with stealing a gold watch, and also with savagely assaulting Superintendent Wright, of the Chippenham police, under the following circumstances :-It -,peared that on Monday there was a pigeon shooting mnatch i a fiold near the Folly 1 avern, which is situate between Bath Lnd the vilago of Bathampton. A largo number of people were in attendance, and after the inatch tbo prisoner and xeveral others, all of them strangers to Bath, collected a crowd around theni. Presently tho prisoner snatched a gold %ratch fromn tho pocket of Mr Green, of the Bxcter Inn, Bath, but was immediately keided and throNva down, apon which he handed the watch to another party, and it was returned to the owner. Tbo prisoner then, by the aid of his frionds, one of whom handed hiin a largo
-naife, ecaped through the crowd, and, being pursued, made bis way to tho river Avon, into which he plunged, und swam to the opposite bank. Hero, however, by a lucky accident he was brought to bay. Superintendent Wright, of the Chippenham police, happened to be driving along the London-road, and, having a view of what was going on upon the opposite side of the river, he alighted and ran downa fi*l , arriving just in time to meet the prisoner as le emerged from the water. Though almost exhausted, and shiver-ng with cold, the prisoner made a desperato resistanoe against the atttmpts of the superintendent and aeveral labourers whom he had called to his assistance to captiur him. The knife fortunately was knocked from his band, upon which he closed with the officer, aud bit him in the arm and face in the most savago manner, tearing tho 'desh of ono cheek so badly that the officer was afterwards obliged to go to the hospital to hav, it dressed. The pritoner was ultimately, wtth auch difficultv, secured, and, tied hand and foot, was conveyed to the Bith police station. As Superintendent 'Wright was unablo to appear against him oin Tueday, the prisoner, Who is unknown in Bath, was remanxded.

LOWDON, THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1857.
In the House of Commons yesterday, on the order for the second reading of the Industrial Schools Bill,
Mr. ALCOCK moved to defer the second reading for six months, the Bill being, in his opinion, superfluous. District schools had been established of late years for maintaining, clothing, and teaching children trades, which were well looked after by Government Inspectors, and with which this BiU would interfere. Reformatory prisons and schools also existed for vagrant children. Be objected to the measure likewise because it raised ragged schools into undue importance, and because it was compulsory.
The amendment was seconded by Mr. HMDFIELD. Mr. B.AINS, on the part of the Goverment, supported the principle of the Bill, the details of which he admitted were open to criticism. In large towns many children wandered about destitute, and Parliament had more than once sanctioned the principle of such a measure.
Mr. BAXTER supported the second reading, obs rving that the Industrial schools in Scotland had succeeded in diminishing the amount of juvenile vagrancy and delinquency.
Lord STANLEY considered the principle of the Bill a wound one, and, as to the objection that the measure would complicate the law with respect to Reformatory schools, it was because Parliament had legislated on the subject of those schools that this kind of legislation was required. This BiU gave to children who had not been convicted, but who were liable to faU Into crininaljhabits, the same advantages as juvenile delinquents.
Mr. GOBDOX confirmed the statement of Mr.
as to the salutary effects of Industrial schools in Scotland.
Mr. NEWDEGATE objected to some of the details of the Bill.
Mr. BOwYER had so many objections to the principle as wel as the details of the Bill that he could not consent to the second reading. Its practical effect would be, he said, to send Irish Roman Catholics to schools where they would be unfairly proselytized.
Mr. ADDERLEY defended the Bill, the effect of VWch would be, he said, to encourage district *chools. The greatest care had been taken to preye-t unfair proselytizing of Romn= Catholic ohil-
ffi. BrACs added his testimony to the eucceu of e zdustrial schools in Bdinburgh.
3r. SPoowrEB supported the Bldl, which, however, inl bis9pinion, required alteratiomis.
U. PLsL objected to the topplicition of the BiU to agriqulttral districts with limited resources.
Sir G4 STRICKLxD was frienidly to Indusria
schools supported by voluntary contributions, but objected to the principle of a rate, and he opposed the second reading.
Sir J. PAnGTrox said, the Bill was directed to a portion of the greatest social question of the day, and,although it was not entirely free from objection, that was no reason why its principle should not be assented to. He agreed that the mixing of poverty and crime must be guarded against; but this Bill dealt avowedly with a class of offenders against the law-namely, " children found begging."
Mr. E. BALL supported the second readiug; as did Mr. HENLzy, who regarded the measure as a necessary supplement to the Reformatory system. It was a mistake to say that the Bill sanctioned the principle of a compulsory educational rate. He did not participate in the alarm felt by Mr. PALK aS to its effect in the agricultural districts.
Mr. BARROW, feeling, strongly the moral duty of clearing the streets of juvenile vagabonds, objected to a measure whicb, he said, was compulsory both as to the manner in which the funds were raised, and as to the withdrawing of children from parental control. fle objected to the Bill likewise because it was superfluous legislation.
Sir S. NoRTIcoTE replied to the objections offered to the Bill, and after some further discussion, M4r. A*cocx withdrew his amendment, and the Bill was read a second time.
Mr. WErrESiDE moved the second reading of the Court of Chancery, Ireland (Titles of Purchasers), Bill, explaining its object.
Mr. J. D. FITZGERALD opposed the Bill so far as it interfered with the working of the Encumbered Estates Court; but he did not oppose the second reading.
After a short debate, carried on by Mr. G. BurT, Mr. MACARTNEY, and Sir E. PERRY, the Bil was read a second time.
The House adjourned at half-past 5 o'clock.
Had it been possible to make an immediate appeal
Had it been possible to make an immediate appeal to the country on the result of the Division yesterday morning HIR MAjxsTvS Ministers would only have met in Cabinet to resolve on a course so evidently to their advantage. They would not have given an hour's opportunity to the political sections who have just made the discovery that union is force. As we have it on the authority of one of their chiefs that " England does not love " Coalitions," the sooner England is invited to express her feelings on the character of the present extraordinary specimen the better. A dissolution is not, however, possible at this moment. Parliament could not reassemble before the expiry of the Mutiny Act in April, and HER MAJESTY would then be left witlhout money and men for the service and defence of the State. To-day, therefore, the PRBBiIER will propose such temporary arrangements as will allow time for an appeal to the constituencies. A Three Months' Mutiny Act, instead of the usual one for a year, and the necessary votes for the same period, would answer this purpose, and unless the three branches of the Coalition wish to add to the existing difficulties they will throw no obstacle in the way. No doubt there are people who look on such an interval as a sort of Saturn alia, when, like shipwrecked sailors rushing to the liquor, they may indulge in any proceedings, however factious and futile. It is not on behalf of the Goverrnent that we deprecate any course of simple annoyance. The new Coalition has a character to make, and it will not do that by throwing everything into confusion, as well at home as abroad. We believe that Government has no other wish than to take the opinion of the country on the question raised by its opponents, and so far
carry out their wishes. It will, on its side, abstain I from all new measures, only going on with those on which Parliament has fully declared itself. The remission of the " War Ninepence," and, we presume, too, the other parts of the new Budget, will be proceeded with; and if the House of Commons, under its new inspiration, should think fit to recede froni its present decision on those points, it will have the opportunity of doing so. Under these arrangements it is evident that a dissolution may be expected in the course of the present month, and a new Parliament in May.
The constitutional ceremony we are about to go through is, in fact, a trial of HEun MAJEsTis
advisers at the bar of the people. The House of Commons does but perform the part of a Grand Jury, and, as it has not thrown out the bill of indictment preferred by the triple accuser, that bill goes at once to the jury of the nation. When that nation, however, hears of the task which devolves upon it, we are inclined to think it will be rather at a loss to know the precise question to be answered. What is the offence ? What is the substance of the solemn interrogatory, " Guilty or not guilty ?" put to the Government now at the bar of public opinion ? The question is an extraordinary one, and we doubt if the like was ever put to the British people before. It is simply this,' Has Lord PALMIEESTON'S Cabinet forfeited the confidence of the people, on account of a series of acts committed on the other side of the world six weeks before they were here even beard of, and by public servants appointed under a former Administration ? The present Cabinet neither appointed the men nor advised the measures, nor had anything whatever to do with them. At Christmas, when al the world was in the country, Ministers went down among the rest, and there read in the papers, some hours later than the London, and Birmingham, and Manchester world, that an unfortunate dispute had broken out at Canton. The greater part of the proceedings that have occupied the attention of Parliament during the last ten days had occurred several weeks before the least inkling of them could come to this country; and, from first to last, including the firing of a riverside suburb of Canton to prevent its being a perpetual ambuscade, everything took place long before the arrival in China of a despatch from the Government at home. In fact, had the scene of the narrative been the Moon, or had it been a chapter from the Arabian Nfigts, the present Cabinet could not have had less to do with it. it did not even appoint the men, for they were bequests from a former Cabinet, and stand upon their own merits, in which they can well bear all the scrutiny the public choose to require. Here, then, is the question which the people of England are caUed on to answer:Is Lord PALMERsTON's Administration to be condemned and displaced for what it never did and could not do ;-for what it only heard of when everybody else heard of it ;-for what was done by men whom it did not appoint, and with whom it has not yet been able to hold any communication ? We have only heard of one question at all like it, though hardly so foolish a one, and it was put by certain persons who made a great pretence of religion and justice,-" Did this man sin, or his father, "that he was born blind ?T
Of course, it will be said that as Government accepts the issue, declining to agree in the condemnation of these proceedings and the consequent surrender of their authors, it is responsible for them. Strictly and constitutionally Government is responsible for everything that is done by its servants, even if it be in fact wholly beyond ita control, or even its knowledge. They, however, who have carried this doctrine to the theoretical perfection exhibited by yesterday's vote must have borrowed a hint from the system of that Celestial Empire which they have taken under their patronage. We read in Mr. MnADows's work:-" One of the prin"cipal defects of the polity of the Chinese Empire "is the existence and operation of numerous "provisions in the code entitled ' Code of the "'Board of Civil Office for the Punishment of "'the Mandarins$' whereby the mandarins are
"made responsible for a vast number of things cc over which they cannot poasibly exercise any "control, and in which punishments, more or "less severe, are laid down for them in "the case of failure." But we need not travel out of the very case before us for a parallel, only not quite so unreasonable as the new English practice. One of Yam's pretences for seizing the crew of the Arrow was that there was an old man on board whose son was a pirate, and, as the son could not be caught, the old man's head was waanted instead of his son's. Certainly a father may in some sense be held accountable for a son. But according to the Code of our threatened rulers at home a Cabinet is to be held responsible for the appointments of its predecessors, and for the acts of the officers so appointed. This is to hold the son accountable for the father, over whom he can have no control. It is true that Government does refuse to remove or censure the alleged offenders, and does accept their acts. We too, we believe, should have done the same in their case. We are persuaded there was no other altermative, and when the whole story is before the world England will think so too. We shal not at present drag our readers over the ground they have so often traversed during the last week. We may say that, assailed with deliberate outrage by one of the greatest miscreants ever heard of, threatened with more, denied reparation or, what was more important, any guarantee for the future, in the very presence of daily atrocities, and with a fanatic population ever ready to rise up against them, HJI
MAJESTnJS servants in this trying situation acted according to their discretion for the honour of the British flag, the observance of treaties, the interests of their country, and the cause of civilization. No doubt, beset with horrors, and latterly assailed with poison, assassination, and every form of villany, they had a trying timne of it. Yet they did their duty to the best of their knowledge, and we shaU require better and less factious arguments to convince us that they were wrong. It is, then, for not joining in the censure and abandonment of these men that the British people are invited to expel the Government which, among other services, has brought the war with Russia and now that with Persia to an honourable termination, and, with the exception of China,-and must we add Naples ?-has not a single quarrel with any other Government in the world.
Whatever may be the results of the late
Whatever may be the results of the late Division in the House of Commons, there is no doubt that the Government of Lord PAMLrP.STON has passed through a complete phase of its existence. There is a kind of dramatic unity in its rise, its popularity, and its defeat within the space of two years. The Ministry which concluded the war has not been able to control the factions to which the peace it conquered has given the opportunity of displaying their animosity. The work of the PALMEBSTOw Administration has essentially been to rescue this country from sudden degradation, and to place it in a position as proud as has ever been occupied by an European State. The present First Minister took office amid the calamities and terrors of the Crimean Campaign; he suffers his great defeat on the very day that the Persian Var, the pendant to the contest with Russia, is brought to an honourable conclusion. The history of the Administration up to this time is full of incident, and, what is more, exhibits the attainment of long cherished hopes and the success of a great national policy. The first check to the march of Russian aggression, and the first rolling back of that slow but never-resting wave, have marked the period of Lord PALME:RSTON'S power. This is certainly sufficient to illustrate brightly a tenure of office which falls short of two years' duration.
We cannot wonder that the three parties represented by Mr. DisBAxIZ, Mfr. GLADSTONE, and Mr. CoBDEN should be found united against the Ministry, for the Ministry was called into existence by the shortcomings, blunders, aud weaknesses of all three. If the Czar NliCHOLAS defied Europe through a conviction that this country was afraid to brave his power, or wa-s halfconverted to his principles, he certainly owed no little of this delusion to the tone of the Conservative orators for several years before 1853. Among these Mfr. DISRAELI Was conspicuous. The unhappy events of 1848 and the intervention of the Russian EnfPERoR in the affairs of Central Europe were the subjects of his eloquence more than once, and, whenever the meddling Iiberalism of a Whig Cabinet was to be contrasted with somethirg grand, stable, and highminded, the speaker was ready with his model monarch and statesman, the noble and disinterested champion of order-His Miajesty the Emperor of RussiA. The Ministry of Lord DERBY was not long enough in power to do much harm, but the Foreign Secretary of the time took advantage of the only diplomatic question that arose to compromise this country by a policy in accordance with the tastes of St. Petersburg. Europe is even now endeavouring to find some solution of the Neuchatel question, in which the Protocol of London pledged this country to guarantee the absurd rights of the Kn;G of PRUSSIA. Surely, if ever a bold and experienced statesman was required for the conduct of a nation's affairs, it was after they had been mismanaged during the better part of a year through the incapacity of a clique of third-rate politicians.
Next came the Government of L-ord AnERDEEN, with its two diverse and unmingling elements. Had peace continued this Ministry might have continued in office, for nearly all its members were able men of administrative experience, and fairly adapted to their various posts. But war and calamity tried the metal of the men. The proof was too rude for statesmen of such temper as Mr. GLADsToX and his friends. It cannot be doubted that they quailed at the moment when nerve was most required, when the heart should have been bold and the hand steady. Cleverness is very well; refinement, education, and blameless character are worthy of all respect; but all these are useless without that courage and vigour of will which alone can avail in the hour of danger. A country like this, which has rivals and enemies in every part of the globe-which may any day be brought into conflict with some great Power, or some coalition of great Powers-requires something more than a fair-weather statesman. The collapse of Mr. GDSrO;TNF and the Peelites, even more than the failure of the Derbyite recruits, proved the necessityof recurring to a statesman of courage and experience. Of the Manchester section we shall say little. They are in one respect more estimable than their allies, inasmuch as they urge their principles, such as theyare, without anyprivatsinterest. They are independent members, such they have always been, and such they always will be. But we cannot refrain from declaring that, in our opinion, their unmanly and anti-national doctrines, and their habit of opposing all Governments on all occasions, are productive of greater evils than the factiousness of the other two parties. Surely a set of men who inveigh against the maintenance of English honour abroad, and do little bat embarrass Parliamentary government at home, cannot be excused from blame, however disinterested and honest rmay be their public lives.
We believe that to the politicians of all these
three parties the country id two years go, and has tiUl, a strong dislike. The distrust which they inspired was the cause of Lord PALMZnsToN's aocession to power, and of the necessity he was under of choosing his colleagues from a narrow circle. Whatever may be the ability of some of them, there can be no doubt that his Mlinistry has been successful beyond all hope, and has established high claims to the gratitude of the country. Lord P c,xxpzTo-. found himself in the spring of 1855 Prime Minister without any of the usual supports of power. He had to renew a destroyed army, to satisfy an indignant people, to deal with incapable Generals, quarrelsome Admirals, disorganized departments. Three-fourths of the so-called eminent politicians of the country were in opposition, open or concealed. Some thought we ought not to have begun the war, some that 'we ought to finish it at once. Mr. GLADSToiE and Mr. CoBDEn were soon making speeches which were republished with approbation by every Russianized newspaper from the Rhine to the Volga. Even the Premier's own principal colleague and Plenipotentiary to Vienna failed him in the hour of need. Yet, with no support but that of the press and people of England, Lord PAwmRsTox, upheld the cause of the country. A new army was raised and sent to the East. A fleet of a kind hitherto unknown was created for service in the Baltic. A Turkish army was taken into British pay, and disciplined by British officers. On the 9th of September more than 50,000 English troops were encamped before Sebastopol, and by tho end of the year Kertch was garrisoned by nearly 20,000 Mahomedans under our colours. From the depth of despondency the country rose to the elation of triumph and the pride of conscious strength. Before the hMinister had been a year in office the great empire which had so long threatened civilization made its submission. A peace was concluded which, though perhaps less advautageous than might have been extorted had our allies been as little exhausted as ourselves, at least guaranteed the security of the Ottoman Empire, and dispelled the clouds which had long hung over Eastern Europe.
The more recent events of our foreign policy are still fresh in the remembrance of every one. True to the principle of upholding what is right, and accepting any ally who will help to maintain it, the Government was led into a closer connexion with Austria by the course it took on the questions of Bolgrad and Serpents' Island. However much we may regret that any temporary difference of opinion should have separated us from our French Allies, we cannot but approve the vigour the Government then displayed, the result of which has been to raise the character of England throughout the Continent, and to strengthen the resolution of Austria and Turkey to defend to the last all that was gained during the late war. If Lord P.xvirsTox; had been anxious to intermeddle for its own sake, he might have found ful scope for his genius in the affair of Neuchatel. However, his Government has, we think, wisely declined to be any surety for the King of PP.ussIA, and has therefore escaped bringing England into disputes which, though not dangerous, are likely to be troublesome and unsatisfactory.
If we turn to domestic affairs, we have no cause to complain of the present Government. The country is prosperous beyond aU precedent, and though in some departments of labour there exists distress, this is only one of the natural results of a change from war to peace, and the evils are far less than we had any reason to expect or hope. Commercial enterprise has been released from its last shackle by the recognition of the principle of Limited Liability. Trade is so prosperous that the exports of 1856, which were 20,000,0001. in advance of those of 1855, seem likely to be largely surpassed in the present year. On the whole, if the duty of a Minister is to develope national prosperity at home and support national honour abroad, Lord PAiNiErusrox may call for the approval of his countrymen. The vote of yesterday morning will be learnt with exultation in every despotic Court, every meddling Legation, every intriguing saloi where the greatness and good fame of this country are envied; but we think that it will find no response in the hearts of the English people, who know what their present Minister is, vwhat he has done, what he aims at, and to what men his fall must leave the conduct of the nation's affairs.
By the recent mails from the United States we
By the recent mails from the United States we are furnished with full particulas of the proceedings hitherto taken in the murder of Dr. BMxIDEw -one of the most extraordinary crimes of this or any other age. The reports, in fact, are somewhat too full for a correct appreciation of the real bearings of the case. TY' hirds, or probably four-fifths of the evidence .aken before the Coroner, must be at once dismissed from consideration as totaly irrelevant. It is not for us to impugn the judicial customs of otber nations, but certainly a more violent contradiction to English nsages in such matters than the inquest at New York into the manner in which the late Dr. BuRDxr. came to so tra,ical an end can scarcely be conceived. Coroner, jurymen, reporters, doctors, prisoners, witnesses, clairvoyants, gossips, and outsiders of every class freely had their say. Letters and communications from anybody and everybody were read in open court, discussed, aud joked over, to the apparent satisfaction of all persons present, and this at a length which is perfectly appalling to the unfortunate student of the proceedings. Merely to peruse in a cursory manner the reports which mainly fill the columns of the lYew York Herald from the 1st to the 15th of February inclusive would give to a swift reader full occupation for a laborious day. Nothing can be more grotesque or ludicrous, according to our notions, than tbe manner in which the affair is handled by the New York press. They deal with it as the managers of a heavy melodramatic establishment would deal with some sanguinary novelty which they were endeavouring to thrust upon public notice. Here are a few of the headings:"H ornble and Mysterious Mfurder in Bond-street." "The Doctor Strangled, and xtabbed in many "places." " Articles of Bedelothing found covered "with Blood." "Inten3e Excitement throughout "the City." "Startling Developments." " Thou" sands visit the Scene of the Tragedy." " Mrs. "CUNWINGRA3Y plots to involve Dr. BuiRDnU in "Difficulty." " The Neighbours hear the Cry of
' Murder,' and fix the Exact Hour of the Deed." "Powerful Microscopic Analysis of the Blood." " Funeral of the Victim." " The Church "crowded, and Broadway bloclked up." " Dr. "BuRDELL is seen twice on the fatal night." "Testimony of Misses HanrN and Auousr,." "Description of their Appearance." " They "Swear to the Marriage." " Mrs. CuizimoxLx "kept the Doctor's Revolver." " Great Excite"ment." "Missm HxnaN Cuis-x;HeA] and "Master G. W. CUNN1iroAx again on the "Stand." "The Doctor is seen to enter the "House." " EcKEL then comes to the front "Door." " SNODOMAss again on the Stand." "The "mysterious JonK don't know anything of the "Murder." " Sceno between Captain RP.NxRs and "SNoD;auss." The reader may conceive that it is not a very easy matter to pick out the few really available facts from the mass of irrelevaut matter which was cast before the public at New York in so loose a manner, but we trut-t that in the following
brief resumiof them nothing of real importance has escaped our attention.
Dr. HaRVzY BuRDELL, a man of about 45 years of age, had amaaed a considerable fortune in his occupstion as a dentist, ana was, until the lat days of January in the presnt yesr, residing at 31, Bond-street, in the city of New York. Se had been married, and divorced. In the same house there lived a widow, Mrs. COUWX1S AMG%: by name, with her two daughters and her two sons. The other occupants of the house on the night of the murder were Jomu J. EcxET, GxoRoa VAL SxODGRA.a-, and the cook. Besides these persons, the Hon. DAVID ULLMs?i lodged in the house. It may be as well to say that the gentleman last named may bo dismiued at once from our consideration He returned home on the night in question at an hour later than the one on which the murder must have been committed, and his presence only so far enters into account that it serves to show that after midnight all w.as quiet in 31, Bond-street. The previous higtory of Dr. BunDrirLa, of Ecxzr, and of Mm CU-rHa5R
was far indeed from respectable. Dr. BuxDIL, however, there can be little doubt, was entrapped by the widow. It was her object to obtain comImand over his purse, either by becoming his wife, or in any other manner which might come the readiest to her hand. It is tolerably clear that she had been his mistress, and she was at the time of the murder the mistress of ECrzrL also. Dr. BuxwELT, had met with her at Saratoga, and when they subsequently returned to New York she became his tenant at the house in Bond-street. It is positively ascertained that at the end of October last she had commenced proceedings against Dr. BtRUDELL for breach of promise of marriage, but the action was discontinned on an agreement on hi, part to befriend herself and her children. At this point occurred one of the strangest incidents of this mysterious affair. At the very time sho was busy with these Proceedings against the Doctor she presented herself before a clergyman with a person who held himself out to be Dr. BURDZLL, and to that person she was actually married. It is a clear case of personation, and there appears to be a violent presumption that ECKEL, disguised with false whisk-era, &c., was the person who enacted the part of bridegroom upon that occasion. Scenes of violent altercation eonstantly ensued between Mrs. Ct rrNGH-asr and Dr. Bu"nrn, who was, of course, unconscious of the position in which the widow could place him by the exhibition of the marriage certificate. The imposture, however, was too gross an one to be sustained duringhis life. Mrs. Cu-xrzoHA-M's idea seems to have been, that if she could bear a child, it mattered not by whom, then on Dr. BURPDELs'S death she and that child would inherit the whole of his considerable property; in case no child was born, under similar circumstances, she would at least obtain her widow's portion. She had the false marriage certificate in her possession, and there was therefore a strong reason why she should desire Dr. BuRDxL's death. Three months, however, elapsed before that death wa brought about. Duing this period matters went on between the widow and the Doctor from bad to worse. He accused her of robbing him; she on her side sent for a person residing in New York, and told him that she had seen Dr. BuRD LL intriguing with his wife, doubtless in the expectation that under the influence of resentment the husband thus deceived might make a violent assault upon the life of the man whose death she so much desired. Dr. BuRDm seems to have been conscious of his danger, and more than once expressed his apprehension that mrs. CU-YxrGIHAM and her paramour Ec-ar. would murder him some night. At last he made up his mind that he would get rid of her, and was about to sign a lease which would have necessitated MIrs. CUN-NIo£A's departure on the 1st of MIay. She obtained information of the fact, and appears to have taken her measures accordingly.
Dr. BURDELL was murdered in his own room on Friday, the 30th of January, between the hours of 10 and 11 p.m. The alarm was not given until the next morning, when the body was discovered by the boy who came to clean boots, carry up coals, &c. On entering the Doctors room at the hour named, he found his body lying near the door bathed in blood. The house was at once alarrmed, and the officers of justice and the doctors summoned to the scene. Now, the leading point in the case appears to be this:if it can be shown that Dr. BURDELL was murdered at the hour named, the proof will press with terrible weight against Mrs. CumNLNOGAx and EcKEL. According to their own admission, they were all up and stirring on the floor above the one on which the murder was committed. This was on the second floor; they slept on the third. First, there was the appearance and condition of the body, which proved that the man must have been dead many hours when the boy entered his room. Then there is the testimony of M`r. ULLarA, 'who, after midnight, returned home, and testified that the honse was quiet from that hour. Then there is the testimony of a neighbour who lived opposite, and of more than one person passing in the street, who depose to having heard a stifled cry of " Murder !" at the critical moment. The conclusive evidence, however, against the suspected inmates-if it cannot be shaken or discredited-is that of a shoemaker named FARnER, who was walking down Bond-street on the night and at the hour in question, who stopped at the door of No. 31 to tie his shoe, who saw a man exactly answering to the description of Dr. BURDELL enter the house, who presently heard a cry of " Murder !" and the fall of a heavy body. " I thought," said the witness, "the man who went in had got into a difficulty "with some one after he had got in. In half a "minute or so after that noise, as I say, a man "opened the door, and looked out; he said to "me 'What are you doing there r I looked at "him; he spoke in a very rough manner, and I "was afraid. I thought the man who went in "had ordered him to put me off the steps. It "was not the man who went in who opened the "door." The witness FARnEL subsequently identified, and piclked out from a roomfull of
people, ECKEL as the man who had opened the door. Another point against the prisoners is, that young SNODGRASS has been identified as the purchaser, just before the date of the murder, of precisely such an instrument as the one with which the stabs must have been inflicted. What the result of the trial will be we cannot venture to predict, but thus much is clear,-that to 3rs. CuX.,OlGHAM the death of Dr. BURDELL was a question of comfort as against penury. She had the most vital interest in making away with him, and is shown to have been a most unscrupulous person. If she was concerned in the murder so must ECLLL likewiso have been, for the deed was above a Woman's strength, and they admit that they were together at the time. The complicity of the young lad SxoDGnAss appears more doubtful, for in the purchase of tho weapon he may well have been a mere tool, and so terrible a design would scarcely have been intrusted to a young and giddy boy.

"HONGKONG, JAx. 16.; "The English Admiral, Sir X. Seymour, thought it advisable on the 12th inst. to abandon the position he had taken up in the garden of the old factories. After blor l'g up the Datch Folly Fort, which had hitherto been the centre of his operations against the town, he resolred to occupy only at Canton the fort known to strngers as tho Bird's-nest Fort. Before leaving the intrenebments he had dug the Admiral et fire to the outskirts which extend to the west and to the south-east of the factories. This measure, by isolating the walled town, renders it more accessible to the shell from a squadron.
"The fleet of the rebels has joined that of the Imperialistr, to make common cause against the English; 600 war junks have assembled in the river. The Chinew seem deterMined to stop every inlet by sinking junks at the different bars of the Canton river.
" On the evening before the outskirts of Canton were set fire to0-a Operation which cost the English throo kied anc
Eomne wounded-a numerouls squadron of warjunks attacked the trading-steamer Fli-Ii, wrhich wras going down the rirer, but she escapedL The Chinese sent some 20 heayr shots into her hull.
" On the 13th the foreigners gave up the anchorago at Whampoa. The steamers which, protected by the ships of war, were towing away the floating habitations of the English and Amerieans rwere not yet out of sight when tho Chinese commenced pillaging everything left in the doclt and in the different houscs situated on the water's edgeo making no distinction of property of this or of that nation.
" Hongkong is under a real panic, which increases daily. The foreign residents of that colony have forzi a sort of militia, and their patrols shoot every Chinese who ahows himself in the streets or on the roofs after S at night.
"When the mail left the whole European colony.,of Hongkong appears to havo been poisoned, and the faLtily of Sir John Bowing especially wero suffering excruciatng agony. All the Chineso bakers had fled. They are sts. pected of having poisoned the whole community. Happily, no death had as yet ensned.
" SINGAPORE, JAN. 8.
"reat alarm prevails at the European colony of Singspore, in consequence of the news front Canton and the excitement of the native population. Of tho 100 000 inha. bitants of Singapore there are not 300 Europeans capable of beating arms, and not more than S00 sepoys. All the otber inhabitants aro naturally their enemies, and the Chinese, who constitute eight-tenths of the population, threaten the Europeans with fire and pilage. They have
posted up a placard in the Chinese Ilnguage in different pxrts of the town, offering 200 piastres for the head of£tbe Governor, or of the Resident, the Judge or hoad of the Police. This threat has not happily, as let, been attended. with any results. The foreigners have armed themselves, and keep vigilant watch by night to protect their property.
" On the 2d of January the ahops were cloKd in every part of the town; the boatmen, coolies and artisans rcfued to serre any Europeans. The public markets were not supplied with provisions, and all business vas at a standstill. But there was more than passive resistance. The provisions destined for the foreign residents wero intcrcepted, and threats were roeorted to to prevent the shop. keepers from supplying food. The head of the police having induced one of them to open his ahop, the Chinese attacl;ed the house in a body, and in the struggle which ensued some of the police were seriously wounded.
"The energy displayed on this occasion by the Governor finally restored order in the toNn."

The Rothschild Family.
THE BOTHSCHILD FAMILY.
Yesterday afternoon a, marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour at Gannersbury.park, near Chis. 'wick, the country seat of Baron Lionel de Rothschild. The 'contracting parties wore the representtatives of the two .gret-or, rather, greatest-firms of the P-,tbsobild family. -the bride being miss Leonora, the eldest daughter of Baron Lionel, and the bridegroom B,r.,n Alphonse, the 'eldest soa of Baron James Rothschild, of Paris.
The wedding repast was laid out in two large rooms, -ono of which was specialy built on to the dinin ;-room for She occasion. Both were decorated with exqui.ite taste and rsplendour. The waUls were covered with large mirrors, with ornamental trellis-work between, up which were 'twined long garlands of artificial passion-flowers, lilies, -freAthsoforan,go-blooaomsand other emiiblemuatic Flora suited to the oocasion. The outer saloon was ligbted fromtheroof, 'Which was entirely composed of glasi, over the panes of whEich were strained Iatings of white and pink silk in the 'form of a Maltese cross. The subd ued roseate hue thus absed into the chamber beneath produced a nmost beautiful -effect. Tables were ranged along the whole length of both :apartments, and, but that in this age of progress tables turn instead of groanling, we should have expected them to re. assonstrate at the weight of silver which w&, piled upon them. (Ireat centre-pieces, dpergnes, candelabra, rare cups, and anassivetankards, flowervases, and thecchefs.d'euvreoff Seves, Dresden, and Worcester strewed the board in rich profusion. 'The wedding cake, A very marvel of sugar architecture, vwas in the centre at the top, upon, a salver, which for size and weight might have done duty as a shield for AchiUes, while behind the seats of honour rose up a beauffet of gold plate-a background quite ia keeping with the gorgeousness of the whole scene 'The covers were laid for 140. Only tbe lpiato .1 th. family 'was used. We canaot hazard a guess as to either its weight -or value, but it must be enormrous.
The bridal presents, both in quality and variety, were snore than sufficient to have stocked an Eastern bazaar; so -a mere glaice at the most promninent must suffice. Breakfast services, as usual, distinctly prevailed, -there being some five or six of thema, all of silver, Oexept one set from Mrs. Montefiore, which was of -sasive standard gold enriched with the most elaborate chasings. To this princely gift succeeded a long row of candlesticks, gold and silver filagree, and enamel ivory workboxes, lace, fans, jeweUled button%, Prayer-books bound in gold and jewelled, escritoires of huhl and maurque. -teroe, more breakfast services, and a lace parsasol. The latter was in a kind of jewel-case; the han4.e was covered with serpents of rubies and diamonds, and the tip of each rib was -formcd of an oval-shaped emerald and large pearl. Arranged on a table by themselves were the jewels, a dazzling pile, -al given by different members of the Rothschild fanily. -Close by these, and in a well-merited place of honour, were name humble bat beautifully worked little presents from the scholars and pupil teachers of the Jewish free school.
Shortly before 3 o'clock the guests wvho were invited to be present at the ceremony began to arrive. Among those who had the honour of receiving invitations were-His Excellency the French Ambassador and the Countess Persigny, his Excellency the Belgian Nlinister and Madame
ran De Weyer, his Bxcellency the Hanioverian Minister, the Duke and Duchess of Bedford, the Duke and Duchess of Wellington, Lord and Lady Lyndhurst and the Hon. Miss Copley, Lord John Hay, Lord and Lady John Russell. the Earl and C,ountess of Airlie, Viscount and Viscountess Melgund, Lord James and Lady Rachael Butler, Earl and Countess Craven and Lady Elizabeth Craven, Count Caroli. the Dluc de Graummont, Lady Caroline and Miss Maxse and Major Maxse, Lady O'Donnell and Miss O' lar, Lady Hislop, Lady Molesworth, Hon. Frederick and Lady Adelaide Cadogan. Hon. Mr. and Mrs, Henry Fitzroy, Right Hon. B. Disraeli and MIrs. Disreli, Right Hon. Charles Villiers, Hon. Arthur and Mrs. DiUon, Right Hon. E. Ellice, 3Ir. J. A. Smithl, M.P., Mr. 31onek-ton Milnes, M.P., General Ashburnham, Mr. Bemnal Osborne, M.P., Hon. Mr. and Mrs. Duncombe, Le Comte de la Grence, &c. The chief members of the Rothschild family, both here and in France, were, of course, aLso present.
The visitors assembled in the drawingroom, where Dr. Adler, the Chief Rabbi, assisted by Mr. Archer and Mr. Green, prepared to perform the ceremony according to the rites of the Jewish religion. A velvet canopy, supported by four of the bridegroom's garvoit d honneur, was placed .at the upper end of the room. The bridegroomn was then led in by his nearest male relatives, and placed under the canopy. The bride, who tiU then had re, mained in her apartment, desceided to the saloon, attended by no less than 16 bridesmaids, all attired ale in white dresses, trimmed with light blue, the bride wearring the usual lace dress and orange blossoms. At the door of the saloon she was met by her mother, who, assisted by the bridesmaids, completely enveloped her whole figure and person in a veil which reached to the ground, and which is worn in compliance with the Scriptural verse in Genesis reLsting to Rebecca. She was then conducted to the saloon with the sanm- forms as the bridegroom. and placed under the canopy. The Chief Rabbi, having pronounced a most eloquent exhortation to each, the services was commenced in Hebrew. The ijbetrothed then drank of a cup of wine and wafJi, and the bridegroom, taking the ring, placed it on the bride's finger, repeating in Hebrew slowly, "Behold, thou art betrothed unto me,
ith this ring, according to the rites of Moses and Israel.,, The marriage contract was then read, and prayers resumed, the betrothed again drank a glass of wilne between them, and the ss beinig laid on the ground emlpty the bridegroom crushed it wi4h his foot, all the relations at the same time wishing (in Hebrew) that the marriage might be happy, and the bride and bridegroem be as irrevocably joinedas the pieces of ,la-s were sundered. About an hour after the conclusion of the ceremony the visitors sat down to the dinner, for such, in fact, it was. The bride's health was proposed by the French Ambassador, and drunk with enthusiasm, shurtly after which both bride anid bridegroom left for Mentim,re, the seat of Baron Meyer de Rothschild, in Buckinghamahire. Mr. Disraeli then proposed " the health of Baron Jaimmes do Rothschild," and Lord John Russell that of his colleague the Bar-n LioneL More toasts followed, and in the evening a grand ball was given, at which there was a brilliant attendance of the aristocracy and bcau maolide.

DUBLIN, WED xSDAX MOitNWG. A PEER AT FAULT.
Some evenings since the Earl of Leitrim, in his place in Parliament,delivered a short speech the substance of which caused some surprise at this side of the Channel. Few persons were prepared to hear that amid the prevailing general tranquillity the county from which his Lordship derives his title was in a state of disorganization which a dozen or so years back might have excited the admiration and won the thanks of Captain Rock himself. Newspapers were hunted up and files diligently scrutinized, but still no evidence could be traced of the dark and mysterious conspiracy against life and property indicated by the noble harl. At len)gth the asaizes came on, and the Judge's charge to the grand jury was expected to make the revelation which was vainaly sought for in the usual channels of information; but here, again, the expectants were doomed to disappointment; i3aron Greene provokingly congratullated the grand JUry on the peaceable state of the county. There were but two serious cases on the face of the calendar-one an attempt to murder, and the other having connexion with the Riband Society, but as that was the first of the kind ho had had to deal with for a long time his Lordship was of opinion that the conspiracy had gained no permanent footing in the county. Sicarcely had the learned Judge concluded his remarks when Mr. O'Beirne, one of the grand jurors, begged to call the attention of the Court to a resolution adopted by the grand jury, by way of a rejoinder to the statement made by the Earl of Leitrim, reflecting on the peace of the county, and which he begged leave to read for the benefit of all persons concerned *-
*-we present and resolve that the grand jury have seen with astonishnment certain stateiments of Lord Leitrim in the House of Lords which represent tre county of Leitrimn to be in a disturbed state, unsafe for life and property; whereas they can tostify the county to have never been more peaceable, and, considering that these statements reflect upon the gentry, magistrates, and inhabitants of the county, they think it their duty publicly to record their dissent fromi his lordblsip's statemuenits. A copy of this resolution to be handed to the judge presiding in the Crown Court at this asizes, and one forwarded to the Lord-Lieutenant.
" HuGo LYoNS MONTGO:21rEo Y, Foreman."
In reply, Baron Greene observed that if the calendar was an indication of the state of the county, and from what he had heard, the resolution was fully borne out. Throughout the scene the noble Earl was seated on the bench, and maintained a dignified silence.
rrP.AItY BLECTION.
There will be a fierce and for some parties ruinously expenbive contest for the seat of James l3adleir. Both caudidates are determined to fight it out, and, as the support of the Roman Catholic clergy is pretty well divided between Mr.Waldron and " the O'l)onaghue," the result of the battle is not certain. The cotmty meeting held yesterday turned out to be a county farce. The You-g Ireland party packed the Court-house, and, Mr. Waldron failing to obtain a bearing, the proceedings terminated in a scene of uproar. A letter fromTipperary observes that "the O'Donaghue of the Glens"may be all thatMr. George Henry Moore's fancy has painted him, but the electors at large are of another mind, and have unmistakeably evinced a preference for the gentleman who holds a large property in the county he seeks to represent. Mr. Waldron is an advanced Liberal, but no factionist in a political sense, and as a highly educated Roman Catholic he has learnt to be tolerant towards all other religious sects.

Yesterday evening Mr. Henry Ottley, a gentleanan long known in coxnexion with periodical literature, delivered a lecture on the old Italian masters " from the first dawn of the revival in Italy to the time of the Caracci." As the whole lecture occupied less than an hour and a-half, and really comprised a summary history of painting from the days preceding Cimabue and Giotto to& the decadence that followed the decease of Raffaelle and bis contempora. ries, it was mainly composed of a statement of facts; but nevertheless the lecturer took occasion to make in the course of his narrative several judicious remarks on theme5 interesting to the present age, and especially furnished his audience with hints for reflecting whether the pre-Raffael. itism of modern growth corresponds in any manner to the pre-Raffaelitism proper of the 13th century. Moreover, brief as was the notice assigned to each painter, all the heads of schools were characterized with much discrimination, and the peculiarities of the schools themselves were distinctly pointed out. A series of engravings alfter cele-. brated pictures served to elucidate the discourse, 'and in addition to these an interesting photo'raph of Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper," taken imme3iately from the original, and lent by Messrs. Colnaghi for the occasion, was exhibited in front of the platfornm.

A Harbour Of Refuge On The North-East
A 11ARBO-UR OF REFUC.E OUN TIHE NORTH-EAST COAS-T.-The fearful loss of life and property in the iNorth Sea during the January gales has attracted a good deal of attention inthe mercantile communities to the imperative ntoessity of forming a harbour of refuge somewhere on the
north-east seaboard between the Yarmouth-roads and the I Tysne. Various projects are nuder discussion, each locality I advocating its own particular scheme. Redcar, Hartlepoolbay, and northward of the Tyne, Newbiggen-hay, have been sulggested as eligible sites. Mr. Murray, the engineer of the Snnderland-docks, has a magnificent scheme to form a barbour of 600 acres in Henidon-bay, by the side of the ocean track from London to the coal ports ; and the River
Tne Trimprovemnent Commissioners also urge that they sho,uld have aid from the Treasury to extend the pierworks row in course of formation, so as to make the noble estuary of the Tyne a harbour of refuge in eales of wind. Mr. James Mather, one of the river Tyne Improvoment Commissioners, adduces the followine facts in a petition he has presented to the House of Lords in proof that such a place of shelter should be made by the
overnment. He says a harbour of refuge on the northeast coast of England woald save annually from destruction a large number of British seamen and a great amount of shipping property. That oot of 1141 wrecks and casualties (according to the "Admiralty Wreck Register" for 1816) B76, or upwards of one half, took place upon the east coast, And on this coast for 260r miles, from Yarmnouth Roads to tbe Frlth of Forth, there is no harbour of refuge for vessels cauight in gales from the eastward. That in the year 18.;2, within a radius of 70 miles of the river Tyne, about one-fourth of the wrecks of the kl:ngdom occurred ; and that in a single easterly gale in October of that year, within 20 nautical miles of the Tyne, 69 lives were sacrificed in a few hours. That in the bhwinning of January, 1854. by another easterly gale, 110 wrecks occurred in three days within the snme radiua, by which upwards of a quarter of a million sterling of British shipping and other property was destroyed and A large nusher of British seamen was sacrificed; and at the month of the same river, which was sought hy a large fleet for shelter during the gale, 36 wre^ks occutrred, one-fonrth of which on-ly belonged to the port. The crews of the vrecked vessels, with the exception of one. were, however, aU gallantly saved by the lifeboat. That in the terrible gale from the north-east, npon the 5th of January in tbe present year, within a radius of 50 miles from the Tyne, and in the same bay, 94 ships went on shore or f6undered, by which in a few hours 167 lives were miserably destroyed and a large amount of property was entirely lost. That within 20 nautical miles of the river Tyne, where these terrible disasters are crowded so fatally together, a great amount of shipping is perpetually on the coast, trading to and from the three northeqatern rivers the Tyne the Wsar, and the Tees, with their tributaries. The five ports on these rlvers, it ia recorded in the last year's Parliamentary Return on Shipping, had upwards of 8,100,(100 tons inwards and outwards, of which one-half belonged to the Tyne. being about one-sixth of the entire trading tonnare of the kingdom, and more than that of the Thames. That during the year upwards of 57,000 vessels from those ports wete thus expo*d day and night in all weathers upon the dangerous north-east coast, who'e barbours aLre hermeticaUy sealed, the sooner and the more closely the heavier the gale. In such gales those of tbem at the time upon the coasb not able to keep the Pea or enter a harbour speedily founder or are dashed and wrecked upon this disastrous leeshore.

The first division of the 2d and 3d Dragoon Guards em barked at Dublin on Toesday, en the route to Cante-, bury, where both regiments will assemble previous to leaving for India. Each of the regiments is 700 strong, and arranged in three divisions. At 10 o'clock the regimenti were drawn up on the esplanade of the Royal Barracks, and inspected by General Lord Seaton, attended by his staff. The troops afterwards proceeded to the North-wall, the bands of both regiments playing before them along the quass as far as Carlisle-bridge. The division which leftwas under the command of Captain Keene.
Yesterday the troops quartered at Chathan garrison, t, the number of about 4,000 men of all ranks, consisting of the regiments of the Line comprising the Provisional Battalion, the Royal Engineers, and the Royal Marine Light Infantry, were marched to Chatham Lines for the purpose of going through the evolutions of a field-day. The troops of the Line, divided into two battalions under the respective commands of Colonel H. Jervis and Lieutenant-Colonel R. N. Phillips, took up their position in the centre of the columns with the corps of the Royal Engineers on their right, and the Royal Marines, commanded by Colonel E. Res, on their left. The whole brigade was then put through a variety of manceuvres by Colonel W. H. Eden, in command of Chathaim garrison, which were performed by the troops in a satisfactory manner.
Yesterday morning a mounted detachment of the 11th (Prince Albert's) Hmssars, consisting of 110 non-commissioned officers and men, under the command of CAptain J. Miller, arrived at Chatham from Canterbury under orders to proceed to Hounslow Barracks. The following officers of the 11th Hussars arrived with the detacbment:Lieutenant R. O'B. Jameson, Cornet A. B. Binghamo, and Cornet R. D. Napier.
IThe Clara convict ship, Captain Peachey, Dr. Caldwell in medical charge, arrived at Spithead on 31onday to embark convicts from Portsmouth Prison for Swan Rivei. She takes out others from Chatbam, Portland, and Dartmoor, and left Spithead yesterday to emb*rk the latter.
The Dauntless, 33, serew frigate, Captain Ryder, went into Portsmouth harbour on Monday afternoon to be paid off. She was previoudy officially inspected at Spithead by Captain Sir Thomas Maitland, C.B., for the port admiral, and passed a creditable muster.
The Retribution, 2S, paddlewheel frigate, Captain Bar. ker, ordered for foreign service, left Portsmouth on Monday afternoon; her destination is reported to be China.
The Iris, 26, sailing frigate, is expected to carry out troops, if she can, to the same destination.
Gunnet and Driver William Gibson, of the 13th Brigade Royal Horse Artillery, was tried at Woolwich on the 27th -ult by a general court-martial (Lieutenant-Colonel Faddy, R.A, president), for stealing a post-office order, value 10s, the property of a comrade, and appropriating the proceeds to his own use. He was accordingly sentenced to tundergo the punishment of 50 lashes and 112 days' imprisonment. The corporal punishment was in flioted on Monday, after the usual manner, in the Riding-school, in the presence of the entire brigade [to which the man belongs, with the whole of the
prisoners under temporary confinement at head-quarters, and 20 men from each of the brigades and battalions forming tbe garrison, under the chief command of LientenantColonel Montresor. The culprit had been convicted a short time ago by the civil authorities of stealing a watch, for which crime he had suffered a month's imprisonment, and was about to be dismissed. He will be dismissed with ignominy from the service.
The screw steam corvette Scout has been removed from dock at Woolwich to give place to the steam yacht Imperador, ordered to be completed forthwith. The Scout has received a portion of her copper only, and has the whole of her machinery fitted.
Home Colonies the Allies of Emigration.
EOM.I COLOKIBS tJe ALLIES of EMIGpATION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIbiES.
Sir,-You admit with so much impartiality correspondence from the people on their industrial difficulties that I am induced to ask of you the favour of inserting a few words on the above subject from one of a party silent now but not inactive, who believe that the extinction of pauperism is a home problem.
The toneof society is improving. A good deal of attention is being paid to the presenz distress, much more than was paid to previous seasons of elass distress, more wide and serious than this. But vour remedy is certainly not one that keeps pace with the time. Are our political economists all turned Morrisonian quacks, and do they propose to cure all social ills by the one eternal pill-Emigration? I have no prejudice against emigration. It is better to live honestly ina independently at the Antipodes than in vice or depen. dence at home. When Malthus some yeara ago issned notice that mnothers were no longer wanted in England, he seriously lowered the domestic morhlity of this countryand is Great Bxitain now to be discredited in the eyes of all the nations by the confession in 1857 that the foremos. people of the world cannot take care of themselves ? Is pauperism, which even the Dutch can cure, a problem England cannot attempt? M1r. Ernest Jonex's plan ansy lbe deficient in detail or encumbered by indefensible asserions, but it is certaiuly more statesmanlike in principle than the evasive remedy of emigration. 'Why has the admirable plan proposed by Mr. Rowland Hill for the "extinction of pauperism," by the establishment of home colonies, never been acted upon? The Lord Chancellor, to whom it was submitted, approved it. In Mr. Hill's able paper aU the details were laid down with his well-known practical ability. It is of no use that I or 'any of my class speak to you on this subject. We are not authorities. Mr. Rowland Hill is. He and Lord Brougham, I believe, would admiit that the capitalists of the city, if they took it into their heads, might farm all the pauperdom of the land, relieve parishes of it, make a satisfactory percentage, and give independence and self-dependence to thousands of the poor whom administrative incapacity leave to rot into broken-spirited emigrants or ripen into convicts.
Home colonies would have saved us from the ravages of ticket-of-leave men. It would have found independent employment for all the well-disposed among them, and would preventteir ranks being recruited. Oakum-picking, sone-
reaking, street-sweeping are not the kind of employment to which the proud and poor English mechanic will turn readily. Many a man turns thief rather than go through the humilia. tion of getting relief from boards of guardians, who being so frequently beset by idlers and nimpostorsconsiderallmen such. The poorhouse is a bumiliation. It is meant to be so. ir. Corne told us so in Birmingham in his character as a PoorLas Commissioner. I heard him say it. The Poor Law affects benevolence without intendiDg it. It takes cred;t for offering help, but renders its acceptance impossible to those who have self-respect.
Lord Palmerston said lately to a member of Parliament that he would not give the franchise to a people who engaged in "strikes." "But, why,' said tbe m_ember, "should your Lordship think meanly of men who have the pluck to do the only thing in selfdefence open to them? It is English to 'strike,' my Lord." And the member was right. Industry in Eng. land is in a perpetual strike. Masters As often get up coups against the men as the men do against the mastersand does not the Cabinet get up its menaced "strikes'
a iust the House of Commons? Of course it does. Yet you do Not recommend emigration to masters and Cabinet Ministers in their difficulties, but readjustment of their relations. Colonies at home, such as Mr. Rowland Hill proposes, would effect this re-adjustment with industry, and still leave enmigration as an auxiliary. But benevolence in this country is dainty; it is a thing of show-it cultivates " short and easy methode"-it does not like troubleit gives grandly, but trusts to Providence to prosper the gift. It has a Tory pride in seeing the recipient dependent,
ome colonizing is far less exrpensive than this superb charity, and would produce a new order of self-dependent men, and out of our poor and vicious classes rear in due time honest, happy, self-trained families. Thus would ar6e a class of men fit to man our colonies and go out in the true spirit of enterprise, and not as now, as mien despondent, beaten down, anid driven from the labour-market. Are you not ashaLmed to ship off our present labourers ? What do you think of the thin calves of our plongbmnen and the flaccid muscles of our weavers? Should not England blush when her shambling and feeble suns sail out before the nations? We are going, you sa-y, to people the distant parts of the world ; and home colonies, I say, would rear men fit to do it. Buxt I stick to the homne problem :-"1 If the Government can take a raw recruit, anid thump, drill,0 and pipeclay him into aL gooD soldier, so that at the word of commnand he wil muarch Against an enemy, even to the cannon's mouith, suel 'it miight dril anid march an army against the greatest of all
neines-Wnt."I Aam, Sir, Your obedient ean

The New Ex mtinh tatutewatis day prmupIed In the CODvocEtion-house. The conoourse of members was um"sually great, ald a very lively debate took piace. After the resding of the Statute the Provost of Oriel (Dr. Hawkins) rose, and expresged his wish to lay before the House certain amendments. These were to the effet-1, th the examination beforethemoderatorsshouldbemd tlfhter than At present and no horomn given in the achoo * 2, that the Final School of Litere Humani.res shoulddbe retained, but restored to something more like its charscter be. fore 1852- 3 that two final schools for each stndent should be retained; and 4, that the re3uirement of two courses of professors' lectures should Se continzed, one to be necessaily eitber in mathematico or physics. Mr. Hedley, of University, expressed a wish that some member of the Council would explain the objects and intentions of the proposed statute. the reader in Experimental PhiloPhY (Mr. Walker) would suggest some amendments, whlefl the Council were consi daring who should speak for themn. As he had e%preasedi his views in a pmphet, he would not detain the House at any length. He would
rove,-1, that no honours should be given in Moderstions2, that the signatures of al the Examiners should be required to a Testramur. and 3, that attendance on two courses of professors' lectures sbould st,ll be re uired. Mr. Lake, of Balliol rose to repeAt the reqnest of 'r. Hedley, that some member of Council would explain the objects of xo great and sweeping a change as that now proposed to congregation. Mr. Mansel of St. John's, rose on bebalf of the Counci, not as commissioned to speak for them, but as one of the committee by whom the statute was drawn up. He was not, however, an out-and-out supporter of the statute. The chief reason for bringing it forward was the unsatisfactory working of the psent system. The evils of this system he considered to be,-1, the imcreased nuhmberof " plucW whiChitproduoedbywhich pluelCng had ceased to be a disgrace, and had even become respectable, owing to the circumstnce that men of firstrate talent were pluckedin their second school - 2 the uncertainty and confusion in our honours produced by the double clasical distinctions of moderations and of the final school; 3, the multiplication of high honours, concurrently with a diminution in the number of our students; 4, the distraction of the students by the two frequent occurrence of examinations - and, 5, the arbitrary seiaration of subjects and books between the two examinations, preventing the illustration which one is apt to throw u-n another. He considered there were two modes by which most of these evils might be met. One was by throwing back moderations and restoring the Final Clasical School to its old condition; the other by the plan proposed in the statute. He much preferred the former course, but he was wiling to accept the latter as a great improvement on oar existing system. Mr. Hedley, of University, expresed himself not at all satisfied with Mr. Mansel's reasons. He denied that the present system had worked badly. Frequent changes were very objectionable, and the existing system had not really had a fair trial. So far as his experience went, it had worked welL Ithad at least checlred idleness and diminished extravaganoe, as aDl would find who would mRake inquiries of those who keep billiard-tables,liverystablee, &c. The evils of the present system were slight, andmight be easily altered withont any such great change as that proposed. Moderations might b6 made earlier and thehonours lowered. He did not think two final schools too much, or believe that they largely increased men's expenses. He quoted the statistics of his own coDege in support of his view. With the amount required of men for their degrees in Oxford he compared that required at Darham and maintained that tho Durham standard was at leut as high as the Oxford. He strongly objected to the proposition that Testamurs should require only the signatures of two examiners, which was simply an attempt to affixa stigma upon such examiners as were especially conscientious. He also pointed out great practical inconveniences as resuitim from the time when it is proposed that the statute should take effect. The Regins Professor of Greek (Mr. Jowett) replied to Mr. UanseL He considered tha' the present system had not been sufficiently tried, and that its results hitherto had not been unsatisfactory. It had been productive of some great benefitg. One was the establishment of what he might call an English schooL Another was the encouragement which it had given to philology; a third, its prevention of idleness The present systemmightcertinly be improved. He should liketoseephilology restored to the Final Classical SchooL and would be 1la
that men should only pass one final chool. He disliLed both the proposed cl l and the proposed philosophical school. He should hand in one amendment, embodying his principal views. Mr. Tweed, of Exeter, was sorry to find so manymembers seemed inclined to vote against the statute altogether, instead of seeking to amend it. He objected to many points, but approved of others. He handed in a series of amendments. Mr. Rawlinson, of Exeter, was surprised that the Council still abstained from stating their object in bringing forward the statute. One member alone had spoken, and his was a speech rather against the statute than in its favour. He was grateful to the Council for the great trouble they had taken in the matter, butthonght they had done far more than was wished by the University. Nosuch great chan was at al needed. The present system had certain e¶is-the interference of moderations with the final honours, the uncertainty attaching to our honours in consequence, the increase in the number of failures, Arc, but .ight alterations might remove these defects, The moderations might be thrown back, and the honoura lessened, and other similar changes might be easily made - but the proposed plan intensified these evils. AU the ifults which UIr. Mansel found in our present system wouald exist equally, or in a greater degree, under the proposed chane. The moderations were advanced, the honours raised, the subjects increased in number. There would be greater confusion than ever about the Tslue of our honours. With respect to the enCourAgement of special studies, lie thought th. proposed plan would not advance it; men had beter have a full general education, and reserve the study of specialties for afterlife. Special studies would be best promoted at Oxford by the devotion of tutors to particular lines of study. Mr. Rawlinson aLso observed upon several defects of detail, particularly nuon the discouragement of ancient history, upon which he has expressed his views in a "fly-leaf." He concluded by expressing a hope that the question vould be soon brought to a decision, as its agitation was interfering most injuriously with the course of men's reading, and was also annoying to masters of schools, tutors, rc., throughout the country. The Master of Pembroke (Dr. Jenne) thought it generallybest for the Council first to hear the objections that were m de, and then to answer and explain. He entered into some statistics as to the number of "plucks," and defended the "two signatures to a Testamur " as tending to diminish them. He was, however, willing to relinquish this clause, He considered the proposed plan to be merely carrying out the present system, which he considered to have worked well, except with regard to the requirement of two final schools. He could not see that the statute was open to the charges made against it, which were so many that it was imponible to answer them al. Ancient history was, he tbought, rather done honour to, and encouraged bv being nut only in one examination. He hould be willg to accept wsodifications of the scheme, which he admitted was a compromise as everything in this world was obliged to be. Mr. Butler, of Exeter, thought the stAtute did not go far enough. He would like to mee six final schools, instead of five, the additional school being one of theology. He moved, as an amendment "That allpersons who wished might be excused from the theological examination of the final schools." The ector of Exeter (Dr. Lightfoot) was opposed to a theological chooL He thought the term of general education for the clergy short enongh He should move, as an amendment, however, "That the names of those who passed their examination in Diviity with credit should be printed on a separate list." He thought the existuig system of two final schools very oblectionable, as tending to increase men's expenses.
The debate, having nrw continued to a quarter ast 4, was adjoured h the Vice Chancelor, on the motion of
r. Roger.s, of Magdalene Hall, to 2 o'clock to-morrow.

The debate on the new Examination Statute was reumnued this day at 2 o'clock, and was carried on with much spirit till half-past 4, when the Vioe-Chancellor declared the discusson closed. The speakers who addressed the House were Mr. Rogers of Magdalen-hall- Mr. Chaee, of Oriel; Mr. Lake, of Balliol; the Provost of'Queen's, Mr. 3arshall, of Christ Church; and Dr. Pusey, against the statute ; Mr. Litton, of Oriel, and Professor Conington in its favour. Mr. Go:don, of Christ Churcb, replied to an objection taken by Mr. Hedley, of University, on the preceding day, with respect to the little consultation that the Council had held with tutors and others intimately acquainted with the examinations LMr. Gordon caUed attentiontoanoticewhichha been
inted and circulated, inviting the evidence of members of (ngregation zenerally, The Ifaster of BlaUiol (Dr. Scott) justified 'dir. Hedley, and mentioned that motions had been made both in committee nd in the Council that further steps should be taken to learn the general wisbes of Congregation, but that the niotions had been negatived. Mr-. Hedley explained that he had not seen the paper produced by Mir. Gordon. Amendments were hande in by Mr. Rogers, Mr. Cbase. Mr. Litton, Dr. Pnsey, Mr. Xeate, of Oriel, the Principal of New-inn-hall, Mr. Rawlinson, and Mr. Mleyrick, of Trinity. The amendment of Professor Jowett, recommending the retention of Mloderations in their oresent (general) character, and the continuance of the existir g final school without any subdivision, but accepting the substitntion of one final school in the place of two, received the sigpatures of several influential persons.

BOYAL BRITISH BANK.
Yesterday evening a gencral meeting of the depontorswas held at the Freemason-' Tavern, Great Queen-street, for the purpose of obtaining their assent to the compromise proposed by the shareholders. and which had been approved by tbe commzrittee of depositors. lesolutions were Also to be submitted to the meeting in favour of a general Act of Par liaaueut, by which the above object might be effected.
The large room of the tavern was crowded by anxious creditors of this notorious bank, and at 7 o'clock it was oro posed that Mr. James Wyld, tho chairman of the committee, should tal-e the chair. Some oppogition was evinced by a small body of persons, led on by a Mr. Dwyer, who said that the chair ought not to be occupied by any one who was already committed to a particular line of action, and he therefore proposed that Dr. Wakley should preside. ruch noise and confusion ensced, when Mr. Dwyer at length became so excited that be was obliged to be ejected by force from the room. After considerable delay, and after many irregnlar speeches had been mads, the meeting settled down quietly, And on A show of hands Mr. Wyld was all but unanimously called to the chair.
The CHPrMAN said they were met to discuss u important question affecting their own interests, and he hoped the proposition which was about to be submitted to them would be discussed fairly and dispassionately. It had been said that he was oommitted to a certain line of conduct; he was certainly committed to one line of conduct, which was to obtain for the de positors of the British Bank xal that it wasPossible to obtain for them. (Cheers.) Xr. Wyld then entered into an historical detail of aUl the proceedings which had taken place from the time of the failure of the bank on Sept. 3, ]S56, down to the present dsy in the Court of Chancery, and in bankruptcy, and with which our readers must be quite familiar. After desribing the contest between the assignees of the creditors inbankruptcyand the oficialmanager of the shareholders in Chancery, andthefactthattbeassignees finally succeeded in getting possession of the property, be proceeded to sate that a dividend of 5 G6d. in the pound was immediately declared, and that but for thevexatious delays occasioned by the present disgraceful state of the lawr a further dividend of 2,. or 3s. in the pound would lhav been paid before this. He hoped that would be done within the next two months, and if the estate should turn out accordig to tr. Colman's expectations there Ws reason to believe that a further dividend of I&or2s. mightbe reelizod, and then the estate would, he believed, be exhaustedL But the committee had not confiued their exertions to the distribution of the funds already obtained; they had endeavoured to effect an arrangement with the shareholders, which should be beneficial to the depositors, and at tho same time the least onerous to the shareholders themselves it wlas found that somne of the creditors were pursuing and harassing individual shareholders, driving them into the Bank. ruptcy Court, and turning their wives and children into the streets, not for the purpose merely, let it be romembered, of obtaining payment of the debts dne, but to defray enormous law expenses. Others of the sharebolders-the wealthiest and the most dishonest, not being attxched to trade, were flying across the water and thus putting the channel between them and their creditorsm what, ther did the committee do? They adopted that course which he believed time would show was the wisest for them to pursue-they expressed themselves ready to acce t from the shareholders as much as they could get. No doNtit they were entitled to 20s, in the pound, but irL 'what way were they to obtain it? There were three lists of sbareholders-list A comprised the presont shareholders, who were liable for all the debts of the Bank; list B consistod of new shareholders, who, under the advice of an able lawyer, said, 'We are 74 in number' we subsnribed to this bank upon the strength of certain accounts which were presented to us; they were frandulent accounts, and we are neitber morally nor legally liable to p yyon, and we shall contest inch by inch our liability.' lbe third listwere thosewbho were not on the present list, but who had been shareholders during a period of three years It was under these circuamstances that a compostion was proposed by the shareholders A list was handed to the committee with the amount of contribution placed opposite each sharebolder's name. That list had been carefully gone through, and, after the beet knowledge that could be aoquires to the circumstances of every shareholder, the committee had oome to the conviction that the greater portion of them, at all events, had contributed to the full extent of their meuns. No donbt if the depositors insisted npon it they might ultimately get their 20s. in the pound; but though the demand might be just, yet it might not be expedient to enforce it. The question they had to consider was-was it worth their while to acoCet a oomposition of l5s in the pound ? (Cries of -Yes, yes!' "N o, no !") The committee had not come there to prezs upon the depositors a foregone conclusion; they were askdnf for their verdictaye or no. It ws absurd to anppose that any compromise could be carried out without tbe deliberate consent of a lage majority of the creditors, and before that consent would be of any effect it must be given under their hand and seaL (Cheers) They had already received 5s. 6d. in the pound. A dividend of 3g. would be paid in two months, and the solvent shareholders proposed to pay 6s. 6d. in the pound, making iSs. in the poun.r For this Gs. Gd. he had required a guarantee of WO,OL. hard cash, to bo lodged in the joint names of himself, Mr. Lawrence, and Mr, Field. That 20,0.L was to be paid over to the officisl assignee, end he Was to place it against the alls of the directorm The .bject wa that, should, after all, this arrangement fail, the estate would still be benefited to the extent of that 20,0001
(Cheers) At the present moment more than 10,0001. of 'hat sma was subscribed, and the whole arrangement would be completed before the end of April next. (Cheers) It had been said that if they accepted this proposition they would deprive themselves of the benefit of the principle of unlimited liability. They would do no such thing. But, in truth, the principle of unlimited liability was the principle of humbug. (Cheers and laughter.) If every ,hareholder of the British Bank had been liable for every 1001. share to the extent of 5001.he would have paid the money, and all the depositors would have received 209 in the pound; but, s according to the present law every shareholder found himself liable to the extent of -20001- or 3 OODI. for each 1001, he was obliged to shirk his liability by every means that the law enabled hinm to do. The chairman here became suddenly boarse, and wars obliged to resume his seat, which be did amid loud cbeers
Ar. PR TAyIor, in moving the first resolution, said that, unhappily, in this metropolis there were many pettifogging lawyers, who worked mischief instead of good to sociezy. If these affairs had been intrusted to men of business instead of to lawyers the whole matter would have been settled long ago, and they would have known the worst of it. He strongly recommended the depositors to accept the terms proposed, and moved the following resolution -
'That iu the opinion of thix meetig, it ise Cttel to the intereet
of the creditor, of the F-ya3 rlritsh li .k that tho proped compeOition of Ce. 6d. fin the pound, beyond the asmt in bank-PtA:y, ,honld be aocted, and that th e shareholdets sbhud be roquized to pay the saine by lnstalments before the 30th of April next."
Mr. KASy seconded the re.olution.
Mrr.WA ;2EY, jun., then moved an amendment in these terms:-

He believed there were shareholders who were able to p.y much more than the sums which it was proposed they should contribute. HTe knew at the present moment a sharebolder who was on the board of a public company, and who was driving bhis carriage in the streets of lonceon tCries of " Name I) He had been asked to prove thi.; but be called upon the Court of Bankruptcy to prove it.

After explaining tho co-rso which the assignece had pursued with respect to the claim on Mr. H.

. kley had referred they would themselves be the first to condemn his imprudence. (Cheer.)
The amesdiment was then put, when only 13 hands, were held up in its favour, after which the reso,ltion wa pa and earned almost unanimously, *nd amid great cheering.
The following resolution, moved byMn. Fosruit and se9onded by Mr. P. Buowxi, was also agreed to:-

A petition founded on the foregoing resolution was then adopted.
The CnAIMItUN explained that the Act sought for would be a Iublic Act, and would not be passed at the expense of the depositors orpromoters of it. He hxd had an interview
ith the Attorney-General on the subject, and a BiUl would be brought into Parliamnent this session, provided it should. last long enou h to admit o£ its being ntrocuced. (Cheers and laughter.)
A voto of thanks was then passed by acclcns.tion to the chairman, and the proceedings of the evening terminated.

[A portioi of the fofowig appeared in otr seond edition 01 yeeterday :-I
YADS, TUXsDAY, MARcH 3, 6 P.mr.
For some days past it has been repeatedly stated that the Treaty of Peace between England and Persia was signed in Paris. The Belgian journals, and particularly the Nford and the Indpendaltce,
were especially remarkable for their premature I announcements. The latter journal, bn the strength of a telegraphic despatch from Paris, declared that on Sunday or on Monday the signatures were positively affixed. Both journals were in error. It was not signed on Sunday or on Monday, nor up to 2 o'clock tbis day. I may, however, now inform you that it is very probable that at the hour I wrte the treaty is signed. At least, it was this morning fully expected that such would be the case. Ferak Khan stated last night that everything was concluded yesterday. He added that he had made some sacrifices. What the sacrifices were he did not mention; that they are of the nature I have already alluded to I think very probable. But, according to him, the peace is one which is, underallthecircumstances,honourableto his country. I only trust that my anticipations, founded on the best authority, are now realized, and that Lord Palmerstonmay have the satisfaction of announcing to-night in the House of Commons that the war vwith Persia is at an end, andthat, among other desirable conditions, Herat will be evacuated.
Now that matters have been brought to so satisfactory a conclusion after many difficulties and delays, arising in great measure from the peculiar character of the persons with whom Lord Cowley had to deal, and whose patient perseverance enabled him to overcome them, it is but an act of justice to speak of the gentlemen who have lent their cooperation. Lord Cowley has been assisted in negotiating with Feruk Khan by several Persian scholars sent out from England by the Government. They are Mr. Redhouse, Colonel Otter, and Colonel Ouseley. Bnt it was I believe, to Captain Lynch, C.B., of the Indian Wavy. that the country is indebted for the settlement of this question. Captain Lynch took part accidentally in the negotiations, but he distinguished hirself by his zeal, as well as by his intimate knowledge of the Persian language, and the great sdll he displayed in dealing with Feruk Khan. It so often happen that those who render important services to the State receive little or no acknowledgment from the public, that I think it but just to mention these facts.
I am assured that the latest accounts received by the French Government from Teheran do not confirm the announcement in the Constantinople papers that the Persian troops had advanced on Candahar and CabuL. The only movement made by the Persian army is in the province of Farsistan, and the Commander-in-Chief of the army in that province has established his head-quarters at Shiraz.
Accounts from Neuchatel, of yesterday's date, speak of a favourable change in the mind of the king of Prussia, and, did they relate to a personage who knew his own mind for two hours together, would present some hope of an amicable arraugement of the question between Switzerland and Prussia, There was some difficulty as to the admission of a Swiss Plenipotentiary to the Conferences. If I can credit the information I have received, neither the Swiss nor Prussian Plenipotentiary will take part in the first Conference, at which will be present only the Representatives of Great Britain, France, Austria, and Russia. The Swiss and Prussian will be admitted afterwards. The Swiss Plenipotentiary will probably be Colonel Barmann, the resident Minister of the Confederation at Paris, and not Dr. Kern.
The Ottoman Porte has added two majors of cavalry to the Turkish Embassy at Paris. They are Kiasim Bey and Raouf Bey. They have already entered on the duties of their office. It is said that a similar measure is to be adopted by the Porte with respect to the Turkish Embassies at other European Courts.
It is said that the Emperor has resolved that the exterior works of the Louvre shall be finished during the present year; but, as a measure of economy, the interior decorations will be adjourned.
It is stated that the Minister for Public Works has determined that the Great Central Railway shall be divided between the Orleans, Lyons, and Mediterranean Railway Companies.
A letter from Genoa, of the 28th ult., announces the arrival there that morning of the Grand Duke Constantine. He left immediately for an excursion to La Spezzia, which is'said to be one of the finest naval harbours in Europe.
The Duchess Regent of Parma has appointed Baron Anselm de Rothschild Commander of the Royal Order of iMerit.
The Council of State, which was to have met tomorrow, has postponed its sitting to Friday, when it will assemble to come to a determination on the question of the duty to be levied on personal property. The Emperor it is said will preside.

VIENNA, MAncH 1.
Subjoined is a translation of two Imperial autograph letters, which are contained in the official part of the Wiener Zeitung of this morning:-
fDear Field-Marshal Connt Radetzky,-That strong feel. ing of duty and faithful devotion which during a period of 72 years of service has afforded such a matchless example to the army, induced you on my arrival in my Lombardo-Vene. tian kingdom to represent with noble candour that your years weighed heavily on yon, and to petition to be re Inoved from yonr post as Commander of the Army an I Governor-General.
" With the greatest regret I accede to your request, but I do so only because your release from sueh a great weight of business affords me the hope that you may, for a series of years, and in perfect health, enjoy a life which is so dear to me and so glorious. At the same time with this I issue orders concerning everything relating to your future personal position. You will alwaysbe aheartily welcome guest in any of my castles, as well at Stra, Monza, and in the Villa Reale at Milan, as at Vienna, in the Borg, in the Palace in the Augarten, and at Hetzendorf. Your presence will afford me an opportunity of learning your wise views, and of taldng your approved eounsel whenever it may be required. May you long live-loved and honoured by me and by all true Austrian hearts-to serve my army as a living proof of its glory I Your reward for the eventful past you will 6nd in the grateful remembrance of your Sovereign and in your own glorious reminiscences.
" FRANCIS JOSEPH. '"Milan, Feb. 28, 1857."
"Dear Brother, Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian,-In order to give my subjects in the Lombardo-Venetian king. dom a special prof of fmy lively solicitude for their welfare, I have resolved, being moved to confidence by the great Cir-
cumspection which you, my well-beloved, have hitherto displayed, to appoint you to be Governor-General of the abovenamed kingdom. As my alter ego (S GelGvc-r reter) in the

"1FRA2NCL JO3EPH. d ilan, Feb, 28."
On the same day. (yesterday) the Eaperor appointed the Field-Marshal Count Gyuw ito be
Commander of the Second Army, and Commanderin-Chief in the Lombardo-Venetisn kingdom, ia Carinthia, Carniola, and on the maritime coast. As Count Gyulai is mentioned in the Imperial rescript
as Commanding General in Carinthia, CariolI and on the maritime coast, you may be indued to, suppose that theso provinces have been annexed to the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom; but such is not the case. The Commander of the Second Army has his head-quarters at Verona, but the district which it occupies extends from the Po in the south (at present from Bologna and Ancona) to Laibach, the capital of Carniola, in the north. Within a few days the nature of the powers which have been granted to the Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom must be known, and it would, therefore, be mere loss of time to indulge in speculations on the subject. It may, however, be remarked that the victory of the civil power over the military force is much less complete than is generally believed. The riotous behaviour of the audiences of the theatres at Milan and Pavia, and the hostility manifested by the inhabitants of Mantua towards the garrison, have produced an extremely unfavourable impression on the Emperor. According to the Milan correspondent of the OQtefeichische (omerrsepod en, their Majesties saw the great procession of masks on the 25th of February from the balcony of a palace in the Corso Francesco. The desire of the public to witness the masked ball at the Scala on the 24th was so great that the boxes on the third tier were soli at three gmuneas. Iuformation has to-day been given me that their Majesties are likely to leave Milan for Mantua on the 3d. The journey back to Vienna will be by way of Vicenza, Treviso, and Udine. Three membors of the Council of the Governor-General are to be Italians, and the choice of the Emperor is said to have faUen on Count Sebregondi,M. Deeio, and some tnird person whose name my informant had forgotten. As it may be thought that some more striking proof of the gratitude of the Emperor ought to have been given to Marsbal Radetzky, It may be as well once again to state that the latter some years ago declined to be created a Prince of the Empire. The reason given by the veteran for his refusal to accept the proffered honour was, that his son was not a fitting man to have the title of Durchlaucht ("Your Grace").
The Cdinal-ArchbishopofVienna complains bitterly of the license which the civil authorities aUow the periodical press; but it appears to me that no papers can be tamuer than those published in this city. A caricature of Pepita dancing El Ole in apair of uznmentionables reaching down to her heels has given great offence to theijltramontanists, but they themselves led to the sclaldae by insisting on this obnoxiou article of clothing being introduced into the corps de ballet.
STATE OF NAPILES.
(FROM 01TB OWN COPRIBSPON@TI)M
(NSPLES, * 26.
The following information has just been brought to me from a credible source, and is so important that, at the risk of being in error, I send it to you. "During the last month," says my informant, "the King and the Heredlitary Prince have presided at frequent ecclesiastical conferences, at which were present the Archbishops of Naples and Capua, Cardinals Riario and Cosenza; the Archbishop of Sorrento, Monsignor Apuzzo; and the Bishop of Isernia, Monsignor Saladino. These, together with the President of the Council, Cavaliere Troja, had been engaged in drawing up a Concordat with the Court of Rome similar to that which was concluded last year between the Austrian Government and the Holy See." Should this be true, it indicates also a political approximation and union between the three Governments in Italy the most interested in checking all progress and maintaining things exactly as they are; in fact, the King is so tenacious of power, and his jealousy of the two border States so strong, that nothing but some strong political motive could possibly induce His Majesty to accede to a second edition of an Austrian Concordat. My information therefore, if true, is of evil augury for the liberties of Italy.
While on ecclesiastical topics I may mention that a general mission has been ordered to take place among all the forces, both land and sea, to begin on the 8th of March and terminate on the 8th of April. During this period the troops will have to attend regularly the preaching of the priests, and, together with their o cers, go throughtheir spiritual exercises. The priests remain permanently in their barracks. The army and navy will therefore be sifted yet more than they have hitherto been by the Military-Police Commission.
Tuesday, the 24th of February, was the anniversary of the King's swearing to observe the constitation " in the name of the Omnipotent God, one and three, to whom it is given to read the depths of the heart." Accordingly, during the night, notwithstanding the sleepless vigilance of the police, tricoloured placards were attached to the walls in all parts of the city, and dropped in the Theatre of San iCarlo. They were collected by the soldiers on guard, and intelligence of the fact was telegraphed to Caserta. Orders were returned to put the 2d Regiment of Grenadier Royal Guards iu arrest in barracks, with a view to institute strict inquiries. One affiche, of three colours, red, white, and green, has the following inscription on the central white division -
"Per la memoria non peritura
"Della Costiuzione
" Del 29 Gennsio, 1848,
*' Spergiurata sul Vangelo ") 24 Febbraio
"I Napolitani protestano."
Another affiehe, also of three colours, has this inscription upon it:
"29 Genui. 10 Pebbraio, 1848,
'-) ni on peritura memoria.
"Per la Cosituxzione
"Spergiurata sal Vangelo
",,a24 Feb.
"Consrata dal sangue, dal bando,
* Dalle galere,
" I cittadini Napolitani
" Protestauo."
Great activity has been manifested among the police since this fact, and fresh arrests have been made, but the tenacity with which these people hold to their purpose, notwithstanding the persecution and the sufferings they have endured, shows a doggedness of resolution which it wil be difficult, if not impossible, to overcome. Until they have a voice in the management of their affairs they are persuaded that no existing law wil be carried out and no progress effected. Everything, however, indicates a determination on the part of the Government to resist concession in any shape. The Prussian and Russian Ministers have had several interviews of late with Signor Carafa, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and have urged upon him the necessity of conciliatory measures, thougl of such a nature as to deceive rather than benefit. It is said that Signor Carafa was of opinion that he did not dare to suggest anything even to the King A report is circulating that a Captain d'Amnbrosio, on the Staff, and who is Inspector of the Bagni on the Islands, has been to Santo Stefano, Ponza, and Ventoteni. There are confined on those islands, I amn told, 270 soldiers, or more, on suspicion. The Captain offere them the choice of being tried bv
couartmartia), or of aecepting the conditions of the Argentine treaty. The answer is not given. While speaking of thetreaty, Imaystate that thechief of one of the Legations here had an interview recently with Signor Carafa. He stated that he had been informed that the Montesarchio prisoners had been excluded from the action of the Argentine treaty, and he then asked Carafa if it were true that those conditions had been offered to Settembrini, who is confined in Santo Stefano, and had been refused. To this last question it was replied that he did not know. I do know, however, that up to a very late
period they had not bean offered to him, though, having heard of them, he had expressed his desire to get out of his troubles by accepting them; but no answer was given. For the Montesarchio prisoners
no hope in any shape appears to present itself; they still wear their chains, though some of them, even according to the common regulations of a hospital,
ought to be relieved of them, so decided is the malady which the weight of their chain has brought on. Pironto has been paralytic for four years, is occasionally attacked by convulsions, and yet is laden with a chain. The Susquehanna left Naples for Palermo on Monday last.

In foggy weather, such as we have at present, the wreck of the Northern Belle is a dangerous obstacle, which I take the liberty of suggesting, through the medium of your columns, should be immedately removed.
With the exception of 40 or 50 logs of mahogany the cargo of the Northern Belle has been ta'en out of her, and I think it very wrong that the property of other shipowners should be any Tonger imperilled, to say nothing of the loss of life that would ensue in the event of a collision on a dark night.

Sir,-Permit me to second the application in your paper of this day ia behalf of the inhabitauts of Finland, now suffering so severely from famine. I believe it will be conceded by our naval officers who commanded onx that coast in the late war that they unwillingly took up arms against us, and had to suffer losses of private property far beyond those of our real euemies-the UssSians-and much of their present distress may probably be attributed to that circumstance. I therefore respec tully recommend their cMso to the kind consideration of this Christian nation, and beg leave to suggest a public subscription, not doubting that the Swedish Consul would kindly undertake the office of treacirer for his former compatriots, to which Ishall wil-

.Lr. IwM, m resuming his argument in this case, contended that Gslatz was not an enemy's port when the vessel sailed, and therefore she was not amenable to the blockade established by the belligerent. The fandamental principle on which blockade operated against nentrals was laid down by various text writers. The " Frau ILare" (4, Sir C. Rob., 63) had a most importnt bearing upon the snbject of open and ClO" rlvers nf Galatz was not an enemy's port tho claimant's nationality was not an enemy's nationality, and he therefore prayed their Lordships to reverse the decision of the Court below on that point. Whatever msight be the blockade of the Danube, no breach of the law had been committed by bringing the cargo out of Galatz, and the claimant bad a rigBht to transit orer those vaters When the blockading crniser visited this ship and found that she was bound from Galatz, she ought to have allowed her to pams If their Lordships should even be of opinion that the blockade was operative to a great extent, then he submitted that, there being no proof that either the master of the vessel or the shipper of the cargo Was cognizant of the blockade, the cargo was not liable to condemnation.
The QuxyX's ADVOCArT, on the p,rt of the captors, said this was the fist csse of a ahip coming out of ablockaded port where the cargo had been discharged and there hsd Ween a sale by agreerbent In which the claimant had relied for restitation on the non-examination of witnesses in preparatory. The first thing which a claiaant was called upon to do was to show that he was entitled to restitution, and, failing to do that, condemnation must follow. There was no proof whatever that the parties claiming the property were the [bond fic owners, consequeitly it could not be restored (Prao* Sorey). Tbe cxaim was giren in by Ir. Cremidi, of London, on behalf of Messrs Panx and Co., subjects of the Ionian Islands; but a bill of lading had been produced, from wvhich it appeared that the cargo was consigned to Ainbrosiodfs RaILs. The bill of sale was not vernfied, and there was no foundation for the position that it proved itself. Why was not an affidavit produced froa Mr. Rili, who knew all about the transaction? The claimants had been in communwication with him, but they could not procure from him an affidavit to the effect that he was not the owner of the cargo, but that it belonged to Balli and Co. According to the usual practice it was essential to insert in the claim the national character of the clair&ants, but that had been omitted in the present instance. Domicile ws the trne test of national character. The onus lay on his learned friends to show that the caro was den before the claimants knew of the blockade. whe non-examination of witnesses inpreptory was the strong point relied upon on the other side; outwas thero a ingle seaga in a text writer, or a ingle authority to be found, sowiz thatrestitution had taken place wtth CObtS nd damages simply on the ground of the non-examination of witnesses? He trusted their Lordships would m the judgment of the Court below, with costs
Dr. DxArx proceeded to address their Lordships on the same side, but beore the conclusion of his address the further hearing was postponed until to-morrow (this day).

ME GERASIO.-CLAD OB RESflTUTIO` OF CARGO. The arguments in this case were resumed.
Dr. Dmkx, on behalf of the captors, submitted that the property must be comdemned on the following grounds
nrst, the claimant was resident at Galatz, and, Galatz being at the time in question in the occupation of Russia, the national character of that territory and also of its inhabitants, had) become changed-(the "Dankbear Africaan," 1 Sir C. Rob., 107; "the Fama," 5 Sir C. Rob., 106 ; and " the Orders in Council ;) secondly, on the claim as it now etood, the property could not be restored; and thirdly, the
rincpleapplicableto the blockade of such rivers as the Vanube had been clearly down by Lord StowelL With respect to there being no preparatory examiation, there ha never been a case in which a Tessel had been restored simply On that ground
Dr. ADD.D S having been heard in renly,
Their LORDSHFS reserved their judgment both in this case and the Aspasio.
THE ACHILLFS.-RESTITITION OF SRI? AND FRLIGHT.
This was an appeal from a decree of the High Court of Admiralty, bearing date the 6th of November, 1855, condemning the Achilles and the freight as good and lawful prize. rne vessel was under WlUachi%n colours, laden with a cargo of wheat, on a voyage from Galatz to Leghorn, and was captured on the26thof June, 1854, when coming out of the Sulina month of the Danube for a breach of blockade by Her Majesty's ship Firebrand. The circumstaDces of the case were so precisely similar to those of the cargo out ofthe Aspaslo, a report of which has recentlyap. peared in She Tima, that it is unnecessary again to enter into the details, A question, however, arose as to whether the notification of the blockade was sufficiently extensive to include blockade by egress s well as ingress.
Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss appeared for the appellants

The hearing of these suits, relating to transactions connected with the purchase of the Wildberg Mine, now belonging to the Wildberg Great Consolidated Mining Company, occupied the Court nearly the whole day. The chief point in discussion was whether the defendant, Auguste Count Kautorowiez, is bound to make good to the company an amount of 10,060 shares, or tho value thereof, in respect of an appropriation by him to himself to that extent, being part of the price of the mine in qoestion, the purchase of which from the proprietors had originally been negotiated by Kautorowicz, on behalf of himself and other co-contract)rs. The mine was afterwards sold by them at an advanced price to the company, who now impeached the special appropriation by lKautorow icz as a fraud on, the shareholders.

Richard Fletcher, of Cowhoneyborne, in Glocestershire, by wI dated in 1824, gave all his real estate to trustees uPon trust for his wife for life, with remainder to his nephew Riehard Fletcher in tail male, with remainders over; and the testator thereby charged his real estate with the pyment of 2001. to his niece the plaintiff within 12 months after his wife's death. The testator died in .824. In 1831 the plaintiff intermarried with Richard Allday, and, Immediately after bismarriae, Allday by deedassigned to Robert Fletcher, the father of kichad Fletcher, the legacy of 200L, bequeathed, as before-mentioned, to his wife, the plaintiff. Theassignment was stated, in a recital in the deed, to be "as a security for the repayment" of the sutu therei mentioned. In 1844 Robert Fletcher, the assignee of the legacy, died, having appcointed his son, Richard Ftckher, the tenant in tail in remainder of the testator's real estate his sole executor. The testator's wife died in 1852, and thereupon Richard Fletcher entered into possession of the testator'sreal estate, and he now claimed the legacy as the legal personal representative of Robert Fletcher. The bill prayed that the legacy might be directed to be raised out of the testator's real estate, *nd settled for the benefit of the plaintiff and of her issue. The Vioe-Chancellor, on the first hearing of the cause, on the 24th ult., held that as the assignment of 1831 was not absolute but merely qualified and by wayof mortgage, the recita contained in it having given the assignor an unqualiied right of redemption, the interest therebyacquiredby the assignee coald not defeat the plaintiffs right to a settlement. It appeared that Richard Allday was living apart from his wife, the plaintiff, and that he did not contribute towards her maintenance.
hMr. Bacon and 3rr. Chapmau Barber were for the plaintiff; Mr. Malins and Mr. Osler for the defendant, Richard Fleteber; and Mr. Greene for Richard AJlday.
TheVxcE-CHANcELLOR said, that he saw no reaeon to alter the opinion which he entertained and expressed when the case was argued before, which was that the right of the defendant Fletcher, as the executor of the assignee of the legacy, was merely a qualified one. In the view that he took of the case it was unnecessary for him to enter into the qusstion of the merger and extinction of the charge by reason of the defendant Fletcher being the legal personal representative of the assignee of the legacy, and, at the same time, the owner of the estate upon which the legacy was charged. He should declare that the assignment was by way of security, and that the plaintiff was entitled to have the whole of the legacy of 2001 settled for the benefit of herself and children.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, March 3.
COUBT OF B"RKRUPTCY, B;rhall.atrth4 Afarch 3.
Di RE 3. J. nDR TnXan
(Before Mr. C mmsioner Houlnm I
"le bAnkarpt is desecibed as a merchant of Mark-lan., [This was an adjourned examination meeting.
Mr Lucas *ppeared for the bankrupt; mr. Kemp, of Kempi, Clay, an ~bill brokers, in the absence of Mr. RopY, olicitor for the London and Wesbtminster Bank, who, he stated, was enggeod before the Lords Justices, opposed the bankrupt's passing.
There was a protracted dicussion which can only be made intelligible to the general reader in the form of a descriptive summary.
The bankrupt was mixed up in bill transactions to an enormoug amount with four houses-Thomas Holand; Messrs. Von der Heyde ; Barclay; and Christian; and all of whom have become bankrupts. At the last meeting it was arranged that lessrs. Harding and PuEein should be employed to investigato the books of the five firms. There was a meeting at their office, when, the assignees of two of the firms declining to bear a part of the expense of tho inq'ry, and there being no assets, the investigation had not taken place. Mr. Lucas now sod that under these circumstaices the bankruptmight pass. Mr. Kemp objected, and submitted to De Jonge a long list of payments which were alleged to have been made to him by Barclay. De Jonge's reply was that very few of these amounts appeared in his books, as he had only acted in the matter as agent for Holland, to whom the checks oramounts had been handed atthe time. Mr. Kemp said that Holland, although able to make affidavits in the Court of Chancery, was unable, from alleged illness, to ap ear in this court, although he was at the ofice of the of fieia assignee a few days ago. If he could clear up the bankrupt's statements, the bankrupt ought to produce him. Mr. Lucas rephed that Holland's complaint was an affection of the legs, and that, although he could be brought to the court, ho could not be got upstairs. The learnod commissioner said the bankrupt could never pass upon his extraordinary story without HoUand bemng also examined. Mr. Kemp again pressed that tho bankrupt's statement being an extraordinary one he (hr. Kemp) should be allowed, by means of his further examination, to fix him with certain specific amounts, and that the excuse for their non-appearance in his books, he being only an agent for Holand, ought not to be allowed. The Commissioner concrred. The amount was largo, and if the bankrupt could not furnish the required information Holland must. The bankrupt replied to this that it was impossible for him to furmish it to which the Commis. tioner replied that parties who thus failed to furnish necessary information must take the consequences. Mr. Kemp said it was an astounding fact that very large sums were concerned of -which the bankrupt and Holland had given no satis actory account. Had HoUand no books? Why did not De Jonge produce them ? De Jongo replied that this was not his business. It was but due to Messrs. Von der Heyde to state that their books contained vouchers for every item of their transactions with the bankrupt and Holland. T'he bankrupt had not thus kept books, but only said, " Holland has the money; go to Holland." Holland, who had been ill, was so far better as to be at the office of the official assignee yesterday. Why did not the bankrupt moet him there ? There was a large discrepancy of figures somewhere. The Commissioner said he thought the best way ws to examino Holland's books if they couald not get himself. To this Mr. Edwards, the official assignee, replied that he would with pleasure go over the books, but he was informed by MIr. sullin, the accountant, that there were omissions on his books to the extent of tens of thousands of pounds, and Mr. Lucas, for the bankrupt Do Jonge, said he believed such was the fact. The bankrupt made an indirect appeal to Mr. Xemnp for his real opinion of the case, and whether he (Do Jongel had not acted rightl.y, to which Mr. Kemp replied:-" If you ask me for my pnvate opinion, I ain afraid I should damage you very muc by my answer." He was of opinion that Mssrs. Von der Heyde had done great service, and their bosks proved what they said. He couid not say the same of the bankrupt. The evidence of Barclay, as now given, did not agree with the statement of the bankrupt. The lat er Rtated that he paid the checks to Holand; but Barclay said that he paid them to Do Jonge's credit with the Royal British Bank, and that his transactions were with him, and not with Holland. The ba"krupt replied that he never had an account at the Royal British Bank, and that the cheeks went to pay bills as due there, and of which Holland had the procbeds. Mr. Kemp said Barclay had no account at all with Holland, but that the large sums to which reference had been made had been paid to De Jonge as the principal, and not to him as Holand's agent. It was a damning fact that Barclay knew nothing of Holland. The bankrupt denied that it was a fact, and MIr. Kemp repeated his assertion. It was desirable that no time should be lost in examining Holland's books. MIr. Lucas feared they would not furnish the required Information, being in the worst possible state. The Commisdoner thought the official assignee should nevertheless see how the fact was Mr. Lucas thought that it would be labour in vain. lr. Remp thought, however, that the attempt should be made. It might be difficultto get the required account but in the end they might get it, and the money too, nd that would repay them for all their trouble.
Mr. Edwards undertook, on being furnished with a Jist of picuiar biiis,todoal he could to trace their proceeds, and an adjournment for a month was ordered for that purpose.

Mr. LiNKLATxiz, for the assignees, expressed sympathy with his position, but it was due tothe interests of creditors to be informed of tho circumstances under which he had settled 1,2801. upon his daughter after the stoppage of the bank.
Mr. CLurChc, for the bankrupt, said that his daughter was engaged in marriage to a gentleman of thee bar;* that an agreement for the settlement had been madeolong before the failure of the bank was thought of; and that on the marriage taking place on the 23d of September the promise was

WEDNESDAY, MARcY! 4.
The business before the Court was not of sufficient public inteTest to call for a detailed report.
Mr. Samuel Morley, chairman of the Financial Reform Assciation, offered a aeggestion that in certain eases tho brokers of the court should not interfere in bankrupts' estates. It was the opinion of a large number of the wholesale houses engaged in the drapery trade that their own appraisers were sufficient for every necessary purpose.
On the application of Mr. CIDLXY, a certificate (third class) was granted to H. Mopsey, ironmonger, of Mile-endroad. The certificate of A. C. Ayres, surgeon, of Ramsgate, was unopposed, and was granted as of the second class.
The examination of H. Christian, coffee-merchant, of Mincing-lane, wa again adjourned, pending an investigation into certain bills of exchange, to which he had been a party with TlioMas Holland and others.
A second-class certificate (unopposed) was granted to J. P. D. Stephens, wine-merehant, Brabaut-place, Philpot-lane.

Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Poland prosecuted; -r. Robimson appearod for EIulme; and 3r. Sleigh (with whom was Mr. Orridge) were counsel for Dixey, who pleaded "Guilty."
The evidence, which occupied the grexter part of the day, proved the case to be this :-The prosecutors aro the well. known firm of Boacber and Co., of Broad-stret, city, and sole agents for a particular class of French glores. Ths prisoner Dixey had been from February to Decomber last in their employment, and Elulme, who had been a fellowservant with Dixey in another firm proviously, at the time of this matter was *hopman at a wholesale trimming and fringe warehouso a few doors from the prosecutors'. No suspicion was entertained of Dixey's honesty, neither did it appear that the prosecutors know of their loss until it was brought under their notice in the following way:-In the early part of last month Haydon, tho city detective, re. ceided some information which led him to tho shop of Messrs. Hitchcock and Rogors, St. Paul's-churchyard, whero he learnt that omze gloves had boen offered to that firm for sale at a price which groused their sspicions, and the gloves being of the peculiar class consigned to the prose-

Serjeant Ballantine was retained specially, sith Mr. Robinson, to conduct the prosmecution Sergeant Parry was rlso specialy retained, with Mr. Sleigh, for tho defence.
This indietment appeared to hare been preferred under the folsoeing sruranstanmes :-Dr. Wynne held the lease of a house n Finsbury-square, and carried on there his profeseional practice, and it a peared that in the course of janert *ltrcai ones, dlsp utnham, who is the mandaging clernov e surbjecutonr, an ttorney, entered into an arreangemen to ocup heen omrtion *ofuth 1house for the use of lthe family, Dr.e Wynnd,still reiing tsome roomsi on the groeuond oorfor thenpurposam,of his prdofessio, alnd also a bhehedroom in the r pr uto n of the s npremise Thero appeare toupiod be no doubt, tat vey hsoon after the arrangement in question had been carried out, and the prosecutor and his familyt had taken up their abode in the house, a great deal of ill-feeling arose betwcen the prosecutor and Dr. Whnne, and that there were fre-
qunt altercations and disputes betweenx them, and that tihese disputes tvontuahllo r li to the occurrence that was now the subject of inqmry. The smsault in question appeared to have been commiitted about 12 o'elock at night on the 929th of December, and, acording to the eas for the proseution, Mr. Benhim, his wife, lnd the famiy, considttngof two sons and a daughter, were about to retire to bed, tV. bedroom of the prosecutor being on the same landing as the one occupied by Dr. Wynno, and as he was sbout to enter his room the latter came out of his bedroom, rushed upon the prosecutor, struck him with his fist, and forced him Dartlrato the ground; and while he was in this positiven oncledto the other prisoner, Tinley, who, it appmared, was the doctor's servant, to come to his assistance. It was state that upon his doing so Tinley ran upstairs, exclaiming that he would give the prosecutor a pill, and, with a poker, struck him a violent blow on the headtan inflicted two very serious wounds; and, under tfeso circumstances, the present indictment was preferred against both tho prisoners.
The prosecutor, who is a member ofl Jrenish persuasion, and who appearetd to be a muchtoun r and more powerfutl man than Dr. Wyne, proved the fats as abore niaTatedl; and in his examination in chief stated that tho as ult was committed withoat any provocation being tgven on his part. In cross-examination, however, he ad
tted that there had been frequent disputes between his family and Dr. Wfndn, and he would not deny that as he vas passing Dr.7Wy-nne's bedroom at the time the assault was com imttted he caltled out that he mw a swindler, or that be had used tho same expression towards him on several other occaeions. He aicounted for calling Dr. Wynne a swindler btating that he had reason to believe that ois though he ad wys paid him his own rent regularly Dr. t yhne had not paid his landlord, and that consequenity his goods and property were liable to seizure, but it did not aptpear that an execution had ever been put into the promises, aLnd there did not seem to be any fondation for the assertion that Dr. Wynne was in arrear for rent. In answer to other quesions put to the prosecutor, he denied positively that he had ever told his children to make noises to annoy the defendant, Dr. Wynne, or that his object was to compel him to leave the house in order that he might him*elf obtain possession of the lease.
|mr. Sara Denham, tho wife of the prosecutor, his daughter and Albert Benham, one of his sons, were also examined, am they confirmed his evidence ahs to the general character of the assault. The son, however, admitted, in crossexamination that Dr. Wynne had repeatedly complained of the nois tesciht ere made in the room over his head, and that he bad also complained of old broken chairs and dirty things being left in the passage of the house. Two of these witnesses also stated that on the same day the asult was committed Dr. Wynne had challenged she prosecutor to fight, and that both he and the other prisoner, Tinley, threatened to do something to him before night. It ap
peared, however, that this was the first time they had m e this statement,

There 'was another indictment against the defendants charging them with a common assault arising out of the same circumstances, and Serieant Ballantine at first oxpressed an intention to Proceed ith that charge. Upon a suggestion, however, beig made by the Court that the ends of justice had been satistied by what had already taken place in the matter, and that no substantial result was likely to arise from the second indictment being tried, there was a consultation between the counsel on both sides and the prosecutor, and after a short delay it was arranged that no evidence sbould be offered in supoort of the charge of common assault, and an nndertakin^ was given on the part of Dr. Wynne to release the prosecutor from his agreenient in respect of the occupation of the premises, giving him until 71idus.ner to make the necessary preparations, and it wvas undertaken on both sides that no further breach of the peace thould in the meantime take place.
A verdict of Not Guilty was accordingly taken, and the defendants were discharged.
George Edwin Selby, 12, who had pleaded " Guilty" to a charge of stealing a post letter, was brought up for judgmnent.
This lad, it appeard, was in the service df the keeper of a receiving-house for post letters, and he hadH properly and contrary to the Post-offieo regulations allowed the prisoner to remove the letters from the box, and he took tbh opporttmity thus afforded him to steal the letter in question.
The prisoner was sentenoed to be imprisoned and kept to bard labour for six months, andthen to be sent to areforruatory school for five years.
George Fenner and Renry West, who had also pleded Guiltyl to a charge of a similar aaracter, were seatenced ,opectively to six and five years? penal servitude.

John Pasi, 62, and Joseph William EHawes, 40, were charged-theformor with having feloniously uttered a receipt for 2901. knowing it to have been forged, and the latter with having forged the same instrumlent, with intent to defraud the guardians of the poor of the City of London
Mr. Bcdkin and 33r. M'Intyre prosecuted; Mr. Sleigh defended Hawes, and Mr. Oruidge watched the case on behalf of the other prisoner, Paul.
This charge arose out of the frauds and forgeries commnitted by the prisoner Paul in hiR capacity of cleik to tho puardians of the city of London Union. It wil' b. remembered that the prisoner wasconsicted at the hist setsion and sentenced to be transported for 14 years, anld he appeared in the dock in his convict dress, and exhibited the most dejected and miserable appearance. The oeisice that was the subject of inquiry consisted in the prisoner Paiul having presented a receipt for money which he represented ho had paiddin to the bankers, Smith, Payne, an Co., on account of the union, which money he had, in fact, appropriated to his own use, and it was proved that the pretended signature of the bank clerk was in the handwriting of the other prisoner Hav, s, who was a clerk in the office of the prisoner Paul, employed in a subordinate capacity.
Ir. Orridge made no defence on the part of Paul.
_r. SLEIGH made a very earnest address to the jury on behalf of Hawes, and contended that he had merely acted as the tool of Paul, and that there was nothing to show- that he had the least idea that he was doing anything wrong when he signed the receipt, and merely wrote the name by the direction of the prisoner Paul.
The prisoner Hawes received an excellent character from a number of respectable witnesses.
Baron BRA5sswmLL summedup, and
The jury, after a short deliberation. returned a verdict of Geilty against Paul and Acquitted Hawes.
No further judgment vas passed upon Paul upon this conViCtion, but he was merely remanded back to gaol to undergo his former sentence.
The grand jury have returned four true bills against S3award and Anderson for forgery.
The trial is fixed to tak place this (Thursday) morning, at 10 o'clock.

It appeared that Sergeant Thomas and a police-constable, from some suspicions which they entertained, followed the prisoners into a publichouse, where they found the two prisoners. Upon seizing the prisoner George a struggle took place, when the other prisoner tried to throw something on to the fire. They were then secured, and upon them and in the parcel rescued from the fire were found 100 bad shillings, 20 florins, 13 half-crowns, and 11 crown-pieces. After they were taken to the station further search was made, and some other baso coin was found in the coal-box at the publichouse.
They were both found Guilty, and the prisoner George, being previously known, was sentenced to 10 years' penal servitude, and the other to two years' imprisonment.

However, he (Mr. Henry) bad received a letter written by the prisoner from the House of Detention, acknowledging that he was not in a position to produce Mrs. Duke, and adding that his solicitor would not appear. From this circumstance he could only infer that the prisoner had used the name of Mrs. Duke to obtain money for his own purposes. In fact, Lord Ilokebhynd his brother officers, who would be happy to assist Mrs. Duke if she were really alive and in distress, had reason to believe that she had been dead for some time.
The Prisoner.-No, Sir; she is alive.
Mr. HENRY observed, that in that case the prisoner had only to produce her, and so clear himself of the charge
The prisoner said he could not do so without inculpating snother person. He preferred to throwv himself on the mercy of the Court, trusting that in apportioning his * punishment the magistrate would take into consideration his advanced age, and the fact that he was suffering from *disease of the heart.
Mr. 1ENRY iemarked that the prisoner had reason to be tbankful that he was not prosecuted at the sessions. He -would in that case receive a much heavier punishment than a magistrate could inflict. However, he was liable upon summary conviction to three months' imprisonment-a penalty which he (Mr. Henry) should not be justified in mitigating. That penalty he must undergo.
Two ib-looking young men, named Barney Levi and George Wilihams, both of whom are known to the police, the former being alleged to be a returned transport, were brought up for final examination on a charge of breahing into the house of Mr. Joseph Jessel, of 8, Cleveland-square, and stealing a box containing 501. worth of jewelry; and also of breaking into a house in Keppelstreet.
On the night of the 16th of February the prisoner Willlams was found by the police loitering in Keppel-street, and, being unable to give any satisfactory account of himself, he was taken into custody. He resisted very violently, but was overcome, and on him were found a valuable gold watch and chain and a skeleton-key. Wlhile the scuffle was going on Levy was seen to issue from the house No. 12, Keppelstreet, at present unoccupied. He also was seized, and resisted with great violence. In the course of the struggle he was seen by a bystander named Robert Reader to take from his pocket a skeleton key and a " jemmy," both of which he opped on the ground, but Reader pickedthem up. The next day it was found that the area door of the empty house bad been broken open with a crowbar, and that the instrument thrown away by Levy fitted the marks on the door. The door had been newly painted ereen, and there were marks as of some person rubbing the paint with his shoulder, and Levy's coat was marked with green paint in a manner precisely corresponding. While the prisoners were under remand on this case suspicion arose that they were concerned in the robbery at Mr. Jessel's, which took place on the 29th of January. The loss was discovered by Charlotte Cockett, a servant in Mlr. Jessel's family, who was in her own room (the front attic) at about 8 o'clock in the evening, when she was alarmed by the shadow of a man pasing her window. She ran downstairs to give the alarm, and found that the jewel-box, whirl usually stood on her mistress's dressing table, had disappeared. It was afterwords found that an entry had been made by the window of the room adjoining that of the girl Cockett. Footsteps were traced along the roof from the window to a house a few doors off, which was unoccupied, and the area doorof that house was found open, though it had been securely fastened during the day.
A young man named Walter Leonard, a journeyman fishmonger, now came forward and deposed that he saw the prisoners and another man leave the empty house about the time mentioned by Cockett. He at first mistook Levy for some one he knew, but, on walking up to him with the intention of speaking, he perceived, on nearer view, that he was mistaken. After they were gone he was told of the robbery. He was waiting for a young woman he had appointed to meet, and before she joined him Williams returned and entered into conversation with him, affecting to be ignorant of the robbery, and asking questions about it. when he went away witness and the young woman, -who had just come up, followed and watched him, intending to give him in charge, but before they saw a policeman he had managed to escape from them.
It was stated by the police that one of the keys found on Levy fitted the area door of the empty house, and that the jemmy fitted themnarks onthe window which had been forced.
On this evidence the prisoners were committed for triaL MIRLBORoUGH.SmTEET.-On Tuesday Auguste Roussell was brought before Mr. BEADON- on the following charge :-
Mr. Rudolfe Promelle, bullion dealer, Havmaarket, said the prisoner came to his shop and offered 20 conpone relating to French rallways value 4,t500f., for sale. He gave the prisoner 171. lls. for the coupons, but, having reason to believe, from circumstances that afterwards occurred, that these coupons had been stolen from his late employers at Paris by the prisoner, when he caine again to his shop he - gave him into custody.
The prisoner was remanded.
MAaYLEBoNaI.-Yesterday Patrick Hogan and William :ehan were brought up on remand, cliarged with being concerned in a most brutal assault upon Thorpe, 363 A.
Mr. BROUGnTON said that the case was one of too serious a nature to be disposed of summarily, and that the prisoners would therefore be sent for trial at the sessions.
WFSTSrn\sTER-.-Yesterday John Farthing and Charles Moreton, tp well-dressed men, were finally examined, charged ,; srealing 12 5o Bank of England notes.
The prisoners were committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court; but, as Mr. PAYaIYE thought the robbery mighrt have been committed by Moreton (who denied the

Mr. Meldoha, *aeobymist, of L4man-street, Goodman'sfields, attended as inb'wrpreter for both sides.
The zoseclo f,-tVhe prisoner, -who was a friend1
of mine, called to see me last evening, andfl when leaving asked me to see him part of the way home. We had only gorne a few sfteps when he suddenly struck me with a stick up,on the shoulder, and instantly after drew his right hand froin behind him and struck me in the throat. I then saw a steel blade in his hand, but before I cotuld avoid it he stiuck me again on the left ari-n, and, on miy grasping and stsniggling with him, I also received a cut in my left thumib, on which I ran back into the house, 'to which the prisoner followedrme. I cannot say what kind of knife it was, and we were net arm-in-arm at the time. He suddEnjly stepped forward, turned ronnid, fronted ine, and then struck mne.

This evidence was corroborated by several witnesses, and the prisoner was remanded for the depositions to be made out.
Lady Charlotte Proby has sent 5!. and " C. Mf. M." fl5. for the poor-box, and Mr. Peter Pickwick is inf ormed that the receipt of the first half of his note was acknowledged in this paper at least a. week ago.
CLERKNsiWELL.-Yesterday Mr. Birchmore, the relieving officer of the parish of St. Pancras, who, since the meetings of the unemployed in Smithfield and at Agar-town-fields, has been unremitting in his exertions to inquire into anad reli'eve the deserving poor, attended at this couirt for the purpose of making a statement telative to tho resuilt of the inquiries made into each of the cases that had come before him. After the ordinary business of the day had been disposed of,
Mr. Birchmore rose, and, addressing Mr. Tyrwhitt, said, -On Wednesday, contrary to the compact entered into at thisCout te da beore theuneploed camne late to the workouse haing reviusl hel a eeting in the fields.
Whenthe ouht o hve ppled heycamne in a body andI demadedrelef y teirleaer or ll.I felt it my dluty to rfuse asis kown y te reorts lit it is not know tht whn btwee 30 and400of them came. on the Thursday, demanding relief in the aggregate by a strange leader, who brought a letter in the handwriting of Mr.
rinen, but unsigned, I insisted on Mr. lzien attending and signing it. I then showed him the responsibility he was incurring, and so convinced him that he communicated my sentiments to the men. I said I would take down in writing every particular in each case, and institute a searchinig inquiry. The men had all been admitted to the waitinig.rooms, end I gave 10 minutes to those who did not like to stand the test to go away, otherwise they must pass individually through my office. The men had the good sense to take the hint, and 200 went away, leaving 12 behind. To this latter number I gave 84 orders for work, not one of which was actedI on; 12 admissions to the workhouse, one only of which. was used; and 17 leaves, partly in single rations. Thirty-five of the persRons were old acquaintances at my office, so that, with the youths and impostors, little maore than half the number were new cases. The result is, that less than 30 of the whole number, not nearly a tenth of the 3mass who made the demonstration were proper aDplieants absolutely requiring relief. I think Sir, we have disposed of these meetings, so far as St. Pan. cras is concerned, and possibly altogether, as the unemployedI will have commiunicated with each other, although these facts have not yet been published.
Mr. TyRwiuTT said he was obliged for the attendancee of Mfr. Birchmnoro and the statement he had made. Greae difficulty p resented itself at the time in di'stinguishing between thie cases, but it was a very plieasling thng to know that there was not so mnuch distress existing as was
Mr. Berehmode then handed the following report to Mr. Tyrwhitt, which he hadl drawn up for presentation to the directors of the poor, and which his worship perused
R~Gentleneln.-Irt pursuance of the arrangement made with the mageistrate at Clerkenwell Poice-court, which I bad the honour to repoet to i ou on Tuesday. the 17th uit, the gates of the relie 'rig.oEffe were thrown open at 9 o'clock the following morning (Wednesday) aud remained so until half-past 10. The body of unemployed didnot preeseat themselTes till nearly half-past ii, regardless of that arrangement, having formed a maeeting in Agar-town-fields at the, time agreed on for their application to me. At ttbe hour above itndicated they tool- up a poeition in front of the vestry-rGorn. andl their leader. Wr. =ien came into the office and presented a letter to me signed by himsef d- rmanding relief forit0 men who were outside. I deemed it my duty to refu-e relief on account of the breach of compact both as recarded the timne anai manner of application, and gave my, reasons accordingly, It having been distinctly understood that the intimnidation of niunbers lnoose iliamand should not be persisted in. I attended Mr. Tyrwhitt at Clerkenwell Police-court, to which they Immediately proceeded to make their complaint by the mouth of M1r. l3inen, their leader, when the magistrate told them they were Infringing the law by displays of force, even in niumbers only, if by that they meant to effect some special object, and that the relieving-officer haid acted strictly within the law. A. second arrangement was thereuipon made fer their timely and orderly a plication next mornig On Thursda, accordingly, between 300 anIT0 men attended, andl were adro'test into the waiting rooms, that being an off-day, but conceded to them under the suppo= preseloc cicustances, when there would beeno Other applicants pre. sent. A. letter wasresented to me hy an unknown leader, demand. ing relief for the boy. The letter was in Brien's handwriting, but
niot signed. I insisted on BEden's attendlance and his eignature to the letter. He complied, and I then explained to himi the impropriety of asuming leadership and demanding relief ' en masse
as an attempt at intimidation. Further I cautioned him that if Re Persisted he would be held responsible, and I asaured hima I wouidtakre every advantage which the law gave maein resisting such illegal proceedings. Iaedviedbhim toimpressthisoen ll themen sresent, and to inform them thakt every man's name, age, resideace an calinng would be taken down in wniting, and his statement atrictly incquired into, sod I then exhorted him to advise such ascould net bear the scruetiny not to remain. I urged this upon him for his own sake, in order to redeem his reapoisibility and save the poor persona whem he had ruleled from a breath of the law. 1 save hire 10 minutes to do so, assuring him that after that time all who remaineii must Pan througth my office. Mr. lMen faitblully conveyed moy eontiolents to the men, and I was, pleased-I will not say surprised-to Eee nearly 200 leave the building at once. No conmment is required upon this fact. 1522person3sremained, whose caseshave been carefully inquired Into, and the following la the analysis :-64 wern labourers, 10 among thorn impotors in their statements of residence ; 9 were car-
tes a eng iumpostor; 7 were costerinoogers, 3 plasterers 1 an nPoster 1 engineer, 3 painters. 2 pslumbers, I sawyer, I Frrench, polisher sister, I smiith, 1 filemaker, I iron-moulder, 2 cermen, 1 eellarman,I biblllstiker, 1 stonermaon, 1 tinman, I marble polisher, I pictureframe-maker. l umbrella-maker, 1 fainter. 1 cooper, and 1 late in the Army Transprt Corps. There were 6 youths living with their pa rents. I an impostor 35 were well known to the officere as applicants for relief, so tbhat, with the number of youths and importers, little more than one-haif of themn were new applicants, and mnight have quietly attended at the stated times without any demonstration and received due attention. 84 orders far work were given out, anai two only of that day's orders were brought to the worksehops ; 32 admissions to the workhouse were given, one only being made available, and this two days afterwiards. The quantity of 17 losses wee tveen in pressing cases, partly in rations only. It thurs appears that out of the noesbers Makinig the demonstration less than 3U proved themnselves seally in want of tee relief which this Board and I myself Ba Its officer are always prepared to administer. I maY mention, also, that on the same aftemnoon when the relief terminated Mr. Brien himself called to thank me,for the manner Inowbich I treated the cases generally. Permit me to eongratulate the Beard on the ,firm attitude taken, in conicurrence with the importa,nt advice and assistance of the magistrate, and to say that I am gratified in having been the huimble instrument in repressing a dangerous innjovation on the admainistration of the Poor s.
" . E3IRCHMORIE, Overseer, &c.'i
Mr. TyawRrviT said, itvas certainly a very strong fact that so many men should have gone away. lie took it Fthat the amount of actual distress 'was not so severe as wan represented. Ila trusted that all parishes would take a similar course for the future, and he felt quite sure th'at the course adopted was the true one. It was difficult to decide, no doubt ; but, on the other hand, the relievingofficars were better judges than most man.
Mr. Biirchmore said that one of the persons connected with the mnen had informedahint that the same course woudld be adopted every ecar. The directors were determined not to be intimidated by large numbers, hut would treat every case fairly that came before them, They ha to look after the interest of the poor-ratepayers as well as of those Who came before them for relief.
Mr. T-YWiUtwr-, in conclusion, said he -was much in. debted to Mr. Birobmore for letting him know the result.
The sitting magistrate has received sc. for the poor-bo!x from " C. M. M.," an acknowledgment being requested in this journal.
THsAIIES.-On Tuesday David Scully, alias Daniel Cofly, alias Kelly, an Irish labourer, who Stands charged with the commission of serious crimes in Ireland, was brouht u
on remand charged with stealing 321,, the mioneysoufJohn, Connor, his countryman, in the house No. 4, Thomas-street, Bromley.
Connor now said that since the last remand he had received 301. of his money from the prisoner's friends; and had no wish to appear against him,
Mr. C. Young, solicitor, who appeared for the prisoner, said that he had never heard that the case had been compromised until that instant, and bad been instructed there was a defence on the maerits,
Mr. YARiDLLY Paid the prosecutor had done a very wrong thing, in mnaking it up with the prisoner's friends-in other words, compromaising a felony. The prosecutor had better not say too miuch about the matter, for he had unknowingly and unwittingly lent himself to the compounding of a felony 'which was an7 indictable offence and punished with grea,t saverity by the law of England, Uinder all the circumstances, he should discharge the prisoner so far as therobbery was concerned, and he would be handed over to an officer of the Irish constabulary who held two warrants for vary serious offences alleged to have been committed by the prisoner in Ireland.
The prisoner then left the dock, and was immediately capure byan ris plic ofice, woband cuffed him and immeiatly tared or slan, I wa unersoodthat theprione wa cargd o on wrrat wth hecommissio o wlfu mrdr y sabin amaninreadad thathe fed rom is ntiv coutryto Egadiie
Yesterday Edward Jackson, oil and colourman, of No. 11, Leonard-street, Curtain-road, Shoreditch, was brought up on remand before MIr. Y&ABDEY charged with feloniously receiving a firkin of butter. weighing 541b., and valued at 3l., the property of Mr. G. W. Glenister, cheesemonger and grocer, of Spring-garden-place, Stepney, near the old church.
Mr. YARiDLLY said he must refuse bail, and after the depositions, which were exceedingly voluminous, had been taken by Mr. Bowdler, the second elerk, committed the prisoner for trial.

Yesterday MaTy Webb, Mary K!ngt kandl Harriett West,fcsd, ?citohenm,aid -at the CrZystal a4e, who were appre-
lended on Saturday night last, when freighted with no less than 821b. of ell sorts of the good things which the Ihtchen of -that establishment affords, the property of the Messrs. Staples, the contrac rs for refreshments, and John Scull, a waiter, were brought up and placed at the bar before the Ron. G. C. NORTON for final examination for stealing, and Alfred ¢ingett and George Webb, the husbands of two of the female prsoners, wero also finally examined on a charge of receiving, articles of property belonging to the Messrs. Staples, and found at their respective dwellings.
NO additional evidence was entered on beyond the statement of one of the waiters, who swore tha'he hnd placed a cross on a steel he had been accustomed to use at the Crsal Palace, and that the steel produced, and which had ben found at the lodgings of Kingett, he believed to be the same.
In cross-examination the witness admitted that he could not 'rtively say the steel produced was the same he had miarRed.
-Mr. Lund informed the magistrate that since the former examination he had made nquiries, and found that for three years the male prisoner Webb had done no work, nor could he ascertain that he had any visible means of subsistence.
Mr. Dinns, who attended for the prisoners, expressed a hope that the waiterScull, who had been for upwards of two years in the service of the Messs Staples, would be discharged with an admonition, as hehad borne a good character up to the present transaction, and aLsotheothermale prisoners, against whom there was but very slight, if any, evidence of guilt. With ruepect to the women he could not say much, but still hoped that Mfr. Staples would take a lenient %iew of their case, knowing, as he must, that there were others, their superiors in position, who must have been aware of and winked at their dishonesty.
Mr. NORTON observed that Mr. Staples had every disposition to deal leniently with the prisoners, and so had he (Mr. Norton); but fnding, as he did, that the system of plunder had been carried on systematically and to a ruinous extent, he felt constrained to punish the prisoners-thongh not to the extent they deserved, still to such an extent as would act as an example to the other numerous servants in the employment of the Messrs. Staples. In the case of the prisoner S;cull there was some difference from that of the others, and he should make his punishment lighter. That person he should commit to the House of Correction for one month, and the other five for two months each, with hard
John-Frewin, a man of respectable appearance, who has for many years held situations of great trust under the Messrs. Staples, anuc in whose character for honesty those gentlemen had placed the greatest possible relianee, was next placed at the bar on a charge of embezzling four sums paid to him on four occasions by Sergeant White, of the P division of police, for knuckles of ham, and for which he had not given any account.
From the statement of Mr. Thomas Staples, Mr. Lund and other witnesses, it appeared that the prisoner was gatekeeper at the entrance leading to the kitehen, a situation of considerable trust, and it was his duty to see that nothing wtas taken awFay without a regular account being kept; y et he permitted the three wromen in the last case to p ass freighted as they were;* and, from circumstances which bd reached the oficors, he must have been aware of what was goig on.
After alengthened examination, Mr. NORTON expressed it to be his ophion that the case was not one of embezlement, but one of conspiracy to carry on an extensive system of plunder, and remanded the prisoner for a week.
The remaining half of a 51 note for the poor-box hasbeen received from " Peter Pickwick," and also a sovereign for the widow of Jordan, from " L. L."
GsRruNWIcj.-Our reporter was requested to aclnowledge the receipt of a check through Messrs. Coutts and Co. for 51., in the name of ady Charlotte Proby, for the poor-box of this court.

CRown SIDE{Before MWr .Baro7& CCHA2NNLL.)
rah Burr, 39, was indicted for the manslaughter of Ir. G. Denman prosecuted, Mr. Charnock and Mr. Codd were counsel for the defence.
The prisoner, it appeared, was - labouring woman, residing at Ware, and the deceased, who was a young girl, and who at the time of the occurrence was in the familyway, lived with her mother at the same place. On the 17th of November the prisoner went to the cottage of the deceased's mother, and began to scold some of the children, and the deceased told her not to do so, and said that her mother could reprove the children if it was necessary to do so. The prisoner upon this, it appeared, made use of very foul Language to the deceased, and said that she had intended to serve her out for some time, and she would now do so, and struck the deceased a violent blowv, which knocked her down against a sofa, and, not content with this act of violence, it appeared that as the deceased was endeavouring to leave the room she jammed her between the door and the post The sister of the deceased interfered and remonsttaed with the prisoner, and upon her doing so it appeared that she struck her also. The unfortunate deceased at first did not seem to have sustained any serious injury, but very soon afterwards she was obliged to take to her bed, a violent haimorrhage came on, and in about a week afterwards she died; and, according to the evidence of the mnedical men, the death was occasioned by the shock of the system arising from the violence she had sustained at the hands of the prisoner, accelerated by the condition she was in at the time. It was contended, on behalf of the prisoner, that she had committed the assault under a sudden impulse of passion, and that she had no idea at the time of causing an serious mischief to the deceased
*nury found the prisoner GuiUt.
Mr Baron CuAi,NzxLr, on passing sentence, said, that probably the prisoner did not think at the time she committed the assault it would lead to such a fatal result, but the ssault itself was a very violent and unprovoked one and she was responsible for all the consequences of it. He then sentenced the prisoner, who had been in prison since Novem ber, to be kept to hard labour for five calendar montbs.
John Green, 36, was indicted for arson.
Mr. Clark prosecuted; the prisoner was defended by Mr. RodwelL
The circumstances of this case were rather peculixr. It appeared that the prisoner hved at Ware, and that he had the reputation of baving committed several acts of incendiarism in that neighbourhood, endwas tried at these asi7es upon one occasion tor setting fire to some stacks, but acquitted. On the 25th of October it was discovered that a fire had broken out in a building called the Old Independent Chapel, at Ware, and upon the place being entered the pulpit was found partially burnt, and the cushions and a number of books were also burning, but the fire was extinguished before any material damage was done. The prisoner was met by one of the inspectors of the Herts constabulary named Beckworth, coming in a direction from the chapel at the time the fire broke out, and he told the inspector where the fire was, and the officer at once suspected bim and put some questions to him with a view to ascertain how he bad passed his time during the evening, and he also inquired whether he had been "getting on wit anotherjobl? The prisoner replied, "No, it is not me this time, or I wouldtellyou; if you willcome with me 'll show you where it is," and the prisoner then took him to the chapeL The officer then locked the prisoner up, and soon afterwards theprisoner called hun into his cell and said he hop he wonld make a good job of it this time, :dding, "Tlhiis &s wretched place; no one wi employ me, and I nt to get transported. They say I *m mad, but I am no more mad than you are. " The prisoner then told the officer thst he had got over the chapel wall and had entered by the window, and having colected a lot of books in a heap went up into the pulpit and got the cushion and set it on fire as well as the oo}s. He said that the velvet covering of the cushion and the feathers would not burn, bust the books " went a-head," and while they were burning he got out of the chapel the same way he got in and -ent to give information of the fire. The prisoner also said he was very sorry that the offlcer had not " pinched 'him about another fire, and described how he had committed it, at the same time sanying that he was very mierable and wished to be transported. A portion of a cotton haLndkerchief partially burnt was also, it appeared, found in the chapel, which was olaimed by the prisoner as his property.
The defence set up for the prisoner was that he was insane at the time he committed the act, and Mr. Hatchard the Governor of Hertford Gaol, was called to prove that in 1852 the prisoner was tried at the assizes for placing something upon the Eastern Counties Railway with intent to overturn the train, and was acquitted on the ground of insanity. He renmained in custody for two years, when it was supposedthat his mind was restored ad he -was set at liberty, but it appeared that since that period he had been confined in two lunatic asylums Several witnesses living in the neighbourhood of Ware gave similar evidence, and it appeared that the risoner was generally looked upon as a person of weak intellect and that no one would employ him on that accovut.
The learned JuDGE naving sannmed up,
The jury, after a short dehberation, Acquiied the prisoner on the ground of insanity, and he was ordered to bo detained during Her Majesty's pleasure.

MoRDUZ V. NEWTON.
Mr. Knowles, Q.C., and MIr. MAnisty appeared for the plainbtiff; and Mr. Overend, Q.C., and Mr. Newton for the defendant.
There was another action between the same parties which Mr. Overend applied to have taken first, or, at all events, that the parties should draw lots as in the Court of Chancery, both having appeared before the officer at the same time to enter their respective causes otherwise one or the other might be favoured. This his Lordship wonld not for a moment allow, and directed the cases to be taken as in the cause lst.
31r. KNowmEs, in stating the case, said that the plaintiff was a pawnbroker and the defendant a surgeon, both residing in Newcastle, and that the latter had the amabition to acquire fame and reputation in the municipal senate of Newcastle, and was returned as a town-councilor for East All Saints' Ward, and that the party opposed to him was favoured by the plaintiff. In November last, after a com-
limentary dinner given to a Mr. Lawes at the Steamboat I,n u Sandgate, the words complained of were uttered. The plaintiff had a ticket, but did not go until the dinner was over, and the defendant only arrived some time afterwards. There were toasts and speeches until about 12, when some suggestons were made abouta supper for those who had not din!t and one was laid out for about a do7en. There was a debate on municial matters, when Mr. Lawes suggested that they should auproceed downstairs. Accordingly Mr. Lawes, the plaintiff, and a Mr. Thompson went downstairs and sat down in a small box in the taproom. The defendaut and a Mr. Davis came into the box, though uninvited; the defendant sat down directly opposite the plaintiff and addressed him-" Now Mr. Mordue, bekindenough to tell me your great objection to me as a towncounciUor. Is itthe subject of the corporation leasesr? The plaintiff said that was one, but he had others, and said it was wrong that the law allowed one in defendant's position to be a town-councidor for their ward, he being the parish surgeon, and that he ought to offer for another ward, when the defendant said, "Who is this Mr. Mordue who makes these insinuations?*- receiver of stolen goods, a gaol-bird, and a convicted felon." Mr. Lawes took the mnatter up and remonstrated with this political doctor, but without effect, and the plaintiff now brought his action. Three weeks afterwards defendant commenced a cross action for certain slanderous words alUeged to have been used by the pLintiff but which the plaintiff totaly denied, and he (Mr. anowles) might observe that his learned friend, following his client's example, had flung insinuations even upon the officer of the court.
The plaintiff was then caUed to prove the above dircmnstances. On cross-examination he stated that he took a little part in municipal matters, and that he had asked the defendant a question or two in public, and had examined him on the subject of a letter he bad written to The Times on sanitary matters; that he himself was the owner of considerable procerty; that he had been put to expense in erecting outbuildings; and that he was the owner of leaseholds held under the corporation. He formerly voted for defendant, but afterwards he did not when his pocket and patriotism were antagonistic; he did ask the defendaut if he had had a mother, alluding to some misunderstanding there had been between defendant and his mother.
Mr. Lawes and a Mr. John Harrison having been called in snpport of the plaintiff's case,
Mr. OvzRE.ND addressed the jury for the defendant. He said the plaintiff had not come into court to vindicate his eharacter-his object was seen in the sneer at the defendant and those anxious to take a part in municipal matters. The defendant had put the plaintiff to expense in causing the condition of a kind of property possessed by the plaintiff to be improved. He had also endeavoured that in all renewals of leases the terms should be more beneficial to the town, and the pocketof theplaintiffwas affected bythose measures. The time, the circumstances, and the real transaction showed there was no damage in character or reputation, but the plaintiff's object was to prevent defendant being re-elected into the council. On the occasion in question plaintiff had told defendant that he should be opposed the next time, and that it would cost him 100L He had insinuated frauds and corruption * that the defendant had given the pauper electors wine and beef instead of medic.ine, and thereby robbed the ratepayers; and, further, he made an insulting aUnsien to some private quarrel with defendant's mother, then deceased.
After the examination of the defendant, his LoRDsnrp tbought they had heard quite enough of the case. IJMti. natelya juror was withdrawn in this and the cross action andhisLordship said Newcastle was ina prosperous condition if they could afford to spend money in this way.

3A~N-R V. BOSTON.
Mr. Atherton, Q.C., and 3Mr. Thomas Jones appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Pickering, Q.C., for the defendant.
The action was for slander.
It appeared from the statement of the learned counel that the plaintiff was a saddler and the defendant a fishmonger at Newbiggen, in this county, and were in the habit of meeting in the evening at the Ship Inn in the town, and upon the evening of the 27th of December last, while there in company with several other persons, the defendant, who bad formerly had some misunderstanding with the plaintiff, addressing him, said, "I am better than you; you poisoned your mother, and I never did ;" alluding, as tiap plain - alleged, to the circumstance of his mother's deotb, wcich took place suddenly in the month of the previous February, and had been made the subject of a coroner's inquest, endmng in a verdict of "Accidental death," the edeeessed having been found dead in her bed. After the defen dant had used the above words, the landierd interfered, And
fearing a disturbance, reousated the defendant to leaTv the 1cuse, which he dia, ana tbo company separated These factu having been fully proved by various witnesses who wese present, the learned counsel called upon the jury to give his chent fair and reasonable compensation for the izinry he had sustained in the cruel insinuation which had been conveyed by tho words he had uttered
Mr. PicKmvsmg, upon the part of the defendant, asserted tbat the quarrel ws& a mere =runken squaLbble, and that the pMrties had been engaged in a coursing match, and the words
Ad been spoken while the defendant was in a state of intoxication. They had some difference, and the langutage consisted of idle slaug which nobody believed,and alludedto a fact admitted by the plaintiff in his cross.examinationtbat he had hintself, a few days previously to the night in question, called *man named Potts a " Palmer."

He came, and was told another captain had been put in by defendant's father; however, as they had a screw steamer, the Mar. mora, coming into the Tyne, the captain of which was only in the vessd for the voyage, the defendant promised the plaintiff he should have her. The vessel did not arrive for some tine, when the pWntiff demanded payment for his expenses and lon of time, which the defendant refused.

Mr. Hugh HiU, Q. C., and Mr. Russell were for the plaintiff , Mr. Temple, Q.C., and lr. C. Warner Lewis for the defendlant.
The action was on a charterpa;rty to recover for demurrg in respect of the brig Radal charterod by the defndant to take coals, coke, and railway iron from Sunderland to Ahcante in Spain. The defendant was to bring the cargo at his rlsk and expene to the vessel; but In case the loadng or unloading was prevented by ice, high tides, or other like causes, the charterer not to be responsible. The c&.e for the plaintiff was that the cargo had not been brought in a reasonable time to the vessel, and that whereas three days would have been sufficient time to load she took from the 9th of February to the 6th of March.
Mr. John Thompson, of Sunderland, the shipbroker who negotiated the charter, stated on cross-examination that the defendant got tho charter at a freight less than the sum he (the defendant) charged to the merchantabroad, and that an allowance of 4s. a-ton. ws made to the defendant, which he put into his pocket, and that this was a fraudulent cbarter, meant to deceive the people at the other end it was for 16s. a-ton, and had it been an honest charter it shonld have been for 12g a-ton.
Mr. Justice CRoNn1oX.-If true, I do not see why both should not be indicted. There are fresh frauds coming out every day.
For the defendant it was denied there was any bargain about 4s. for the purpose of perpietrating a fraud on the merchant abroad. The witness might charge him-elf with a willingness to do so, but it was false as it affected the defendant, that sum of 4s. a-ton being for tho express purpose of paying for the coals being brought from Mi'dlesborough to the vessel, and 16s. being the whole sum which the defendant was permitted by his principalsabroad to pay per ton for the freight of the iron.
The defendant was caUed, and stated that at the time the charter was entered into it was expressly stated that the coals had to be broughs from Middlesborough, and the 16s. a-ton was for freight from Middleaborough to Alicante; objection was made to any parol eTidence to alter a written document, and

Mr. Seijeant Pi ott and Mx. R. A. Fisher appeared for the plaintifZ and Cz. Keating, QC., for the defendants.
eplaintiff in this action, William Stimpson, ras a labounrig man at Marcham, near Abingdon, and he sued a Mrs. Simpson, his landlady, and also her son Thomas, and Stone the constable, to recover damages for tunming out thelaintiff's family from his cottage into the streets. Accor ing to the?lintifs evidensee it appeared that in the month of May last the cottago in question was occupied by a man named Helier. elUier was about to go to Australia and told the plaintiff that he might bring his wife and family and hve in the house tiUl his term expired, which would be on the 24th of June. In the beginnmng of May, and before he moved into the house, tho plaintif went and saw Mrs. Simpson, the defendant, and agreed with her to become tenant of the house, andto paya rent of four guineas a-year. He then went into the house, and lived there till the 19th of June. On that day, while the plaintiff was absent at his work, the defendants, mother and son, and Stone the constable, went to the house They told the plaintiff's wife that she must go out, but she refused. The son then took a crowbar and broke the door open, and the defendants all asssed in putting the furniture out into the street. The wonman and her children got shelter for the night, and as there was no other honse in the village empty they wero afterwards obliged to take up their abode in a shed, where the woman was confined on the Ist of August of her fifth child. On cross-examination the plaintiff said that about 15 years ago he had been convicted of embezzling 3g. 4d., and he had also been charged with taking a bit of a hurdle, but he was innocent on both occasions. Some little time ago he had been living with his wife and family in the house of his father, but it had been found necessary to send for the constables and turn them all out. The family then dwelt in a stable, till they got into the defendants' house. It appeared that Mr Simpson, the defendant, had made some inquiries respecting plaintiff's character, and not liking what she heard she sent orders that he was not to be allowed to go into the house, but in the meantime he he had managed to get the key, and had moved in. She then wrote and told the plaintiff that she had heard of his bad principles, and that he should not bide; but, the plaIntiff beigin possess on insisted on his right to retain the cottage till expelled by a six months' notice, to expire at the end of the year.
Mrs. Simpson was caUed for the defence, and denied the statements made by the plaintiff as to her having areed to let the cottge to him, nd it was contended the plsintiffhadno nit to be in the houso under Hler's license, as Hillier himself left three days beforo the expuldion and had paid rent only up to the time when he left.

Thomas Gorman, 23,blacksmith, was charged with wounding William Brewer with intent to murder, and with intent to do him grievous bodiy harm, at the County Gaol, Reading,_oxn the 21st of February.
Ar. Carrington and 1r. Gridits appeared for the prose. cution; the prisoner was undefended.
It appeared that on Saturday, the 21st of Febrnary last, at about 2 o'clock p.m., tho prosecutor who was principal warder at Reading Gaol, had unlocked the prisoner's cell in order that he rmght go in the airing ground for exercise. The warder was proceeding to unlock the next cell, when the prisoner came out and struck him a heavy blow on the back of his head with a house brush. The violence of the blow broke the brush. Tho prisoner then threw away tho handle and fetched a three-legged stool from his cell, and therewith struck at the prosecutor The latter parried the blow with his bands, and so saved his bead. Upon this a soldier of the Coldstream Guards, named Robinson, who was in the next cell, came to the warder's assistance, and drew him into his cell The prisoner then assailed the soldier with the stool, bhu the olDcers of other prison coming up the prisoner was secured. The warder'e head was cut open to the bone, but no serious injury followed.
The learned JUDGE cross-examined all the vitnesses, in order to ascertain what the motive of the prisoner was, but nothing was elicited on the subject.
Tho Governor of the prison, Mr. Ferry, stated that he had seen the prisoner every day, but he had made no complaint.
The prisoner wa found Guilty of wounding, with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

Charles Forester, aged 36, tailor was charged with the wilful murder of Samuel Forester, iis infant son, aged five years, at Wokingham, on the 14th of November, 1857.
Mr. Skinner appeared for the prosecution, Mr. Huddleston defended the prisoner.
The particulars of this melancholy caso have already been fully reportod in 27w Times. It will bh recollected that the prisoner had been for some time employed by a charitable lady, a Mrs. Saltmarshe, a a Scripture reader at Wokingham. His health failed him, and he was for some tin.e in the Hospital for Consumption at Brompton. Having partially recovered, he left for the purpose of going to the oonvalescent institution bdonging to that hospital at Bournemouth. On his way thitherhe went to Emmbrook-. in the parish of Wokingham, where his wife was lirinn with their only child, aged four years and a half, and su porting herself comfortably by keeping a small ;hop. H arve at Emmbrook on the 10th of November, and left home on the 11th to go to Bournemouth, but, on his arriving atthestation,he was too ill togo, andwasoblivedtoretorn. He returned home, and remained till the 14th. At about a quarter to 9 oclock on that morning he was seen to go rapidly from his house towards the Policestation. He there tnoclced up the superintendent, and maid he had oome to ivehimel inchage ormurdering his little boy. He sai hi nae ws Freser,but, ont being asked where his c w, he ai did n o ati had fo tten. The poloeman found the prisoner's hands coverod with blood; and, haiving acrandfo him Where he lived %be polieman went t an going into his bedroo;n found the chtildlin on the bed, with its hlead nearly severed from the body,and a razorlyingnearthe body coverod with blood. The prisoner had boen detained in custody at the station.houae. He Ws reatly agitated, the perspiration was pouring down his faco, nd be a- peare to bemuf t shfIidM ndh ai
ersggrea.ang is fnnHe kept cryinig, "Oh dear Oh dear 'and said that he would gie thing if he ondo what he had done, that no y could love the child better than he did, and he could not think what he did it for. It appeared that the poieoner was extremely fond of his child, and previous to the event he wasin a very desonding state of mmd. Several witnesses wero called on the part of the Prisoner to show that he had boen for some years considered to be a man of very wea intellect, and eocentric in his conduct. In the year 153 or 1854 he had been employed by the Taunton Town Mission, Sbut his services wero discontinued, on the ground of mental incapacity and eccentricity, and what the witnesses called irosanity. It a,PPeared that after he had left the ithl forConsumption elodged for about 12 daswit a Ms. iuli Salmon1-lane, Stepney, andthero conducted himself in a very strange and distressing manner. Having returned home ho so much excited the fears of his wife that abe hid his razors, and told a lady in the nei h- bourhood thatshe did not know what to do with hm. The Scriture reader who had suooeeded the prisoner saw him on the h of November, and advised that he should not bo left alone,-- oie was apprehensive something night haopen, and he wrotet yt thowvsnotinastatoto just'iyhi undertaking the journey to Bournemouth. It appeared that on many occasions the prisoner had complained of pains in his head, and that he w reduced to a xtate of the t- most despondency, which wa not induced by his circumstances, or his wife wa able to support herself very comfortably by the shop which she was koeping.
Mr. Justice WILLxs, in summing up the evidence, aid, there appeared to be no motive for the prisoner doing the act charged against him, but, on the contrary, from *I the evidenoe, he was extremely fond of tho child. His lordship then summed up the evidence with great care as bearing on the defenoe of insanity set up by the prisoner's counsel, and eventually left it to tjry to say, first, hther tho prisoner did the act chae4 *and secondly, whether or not at thetimohowasa h c a st to of mind as to be ablo to dis. tingush ight from wrong.
The jury without hesitation, found a verdict of Not Guilty, on tLo ground of insanity.
His LORDSrrP said the prisoner must be detained till Her Majesty's plesure ws known.
C"RTCASTXS OF PREVIOtS CONICroTr.
On the conviction of a prisoner for any attempt at highway robberya certificato of previous conviction was put un The certificate merely sAted that the prisoner at a time and place mentioned had been convicted of felony, without descrbing the nature of the felony.
Mr.Jutico WxLsssaid that certificates in that form wero objdctionable, inasmuch as the previous conviction mnght have been for bigamy-an offence which had nothing to o with the offence now in question. The statute, the 7th and 8th of George IV., cap. 28. sec. 11, enacted that the certificate should contain the substanoo and effect only (omitting the formal part) of the indictment and conviction His Lordship thought the felony ought to bo described in full, as he had some doubt whether such a certificate as the present could be ustained if its admission were objectedto.

The Lord Chief Justioe disposed of the only common jury cause, andthen everything came to a standstill, asthe parties were not ready in the special jury cases. His Lordship tberefore adjourned to 1 o'clock, when ho again came into court, and tried prisoners during the remainder of the

Mary Anne Coles was indicted for sending a letter to George Hood, threatening to burn his property, at Fording-
Mr. Coleridge was counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. W. M. Cooke defended the prisoner.
It appeared that the prisoner was a niece of Hood, and abe lived with him and hi wile. On Sunday, the 13th of July, Hood and his wife went to churcb, having told the prisoner to cook the dinner. On their return from church they found the prisoner had not attended to their directions, and they scoldod her. Sho turned sulkyand would not eatany dinner.

The prisoner was afterwards chargzed wvith setting fire to the premises and with sending the threatening letter. She denied both. A policeman was called in, and he asked the prisoner to write the same words.
It was then proposed to ask the witness whether, having seen the prisoner write thoso words, and thereby to some extent having acquired a knowledgo of her handwriting, he believed the letter to be in her writing.
This was objected to.
Mr. Justice WILL.ns said he had some doubt about it, but he would admit the evidence; but, if necessary, he would reserve tho question.
The witness then stated that he believed the letter to be in the handwriting of the prisoner. The paper upon which the letter was written a*ppeared to have been torn out of a book which was found m a drawer upon the premises.
The JuDGE decided that the jury could not look at 'he prisoner's writing to dgo by comparison, His Lordship said that some persons Pearned in the law regretted that by law such a comparison was not permitted.

This was an action for the obstruction of a footway.
Mr. Field and Mir. Markham appeared for the plaintiff; Ir. Macaulay, Q.C., and Mr. Serjeant Hayes for the dofendant.
The plaintiff is a farmer and landowner at West Haddon, in this oounty, and claims a right of footway for himself and his friends and servants from his house to the church and village of West Haddon over the land and through the farmyard of the defendant; but that claim the defendant -disputes, and the matter had been brought to an issue by the latter in the course of last autumn by digging apit across the footpath in question. Numerous witnesses wero ex-amined in support of the plaintiff's claim, and they gave evidence of the user of a footway by the occupiers of Lovell's farm over the land now belonging to the defendant for very enany years; bat it appeared that above 30 years ago, in one part of the old line of footway, a deviation had been adopted and a new line of footway substituted for the old, although the termini remained the same. Since that time, however, the old path had been disused, and a plantation ocoupied part of the land over which it formerly passed. It was contended, therefore, on the part of the defendant that the old footway had been abandoned, and that the old right had long ceased to exist, and, with respect to the new line of footway, the answer given was tbat no right had been acquired by 20 years' user under the Prescription Act, inasmuch as during a considerable portion of that time the person who was the owner in fee of the defendant's land was under disability-first as a minor, and afterwards as a Jesne corert, and inasmuch as the time during which that state of things existed was, according to the statute, to be excluded in the computation of the 20 years.
The learned JuDGE ruled, upon that ground, that the plaintiff had failed to establish his right to the substituted footway i but left to the jury the question whether the old footway inad been abandoned.
The jury in the result found a verdict for the defendant.

CIVIL SIDE.-(Beforc MlIr. Justice WIGITMMAN and a
Vommon Jury).
GARDNER V. PPAEsSALL. This was an action of trover for a cow.
Mr. Macaulay, Q.C. and Mr. Brewer were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Mellor, Q.C., and Mr. Bell for the defendant.
The defendant in May of last year had purcltased the cow in question, together with another, which he had since sold, from a person named Bennett; and the questioninthe cause was whether, previously to the sale to the defendant, Bennett had not sold the two cows to the plaintiff
It appeared thatBennett was tenant of a small grazing fani at Stulby, near Welford, in this connty, under Mr. and Lady Elizabeth Villiers; that at the beginning of 1855 he was in greatly embarrassed circumstances, there being an execution out against him, and his rent being in arrear. Under these circumstances he applied to the plaintiff to befriend him; and the plaintiff, being Willing to do so, accompanied him in the beginning of May to the office of a solicitor, who was the agent of Mr. and Lady Villiers, and instructed him to prepare an agreemnent between them whereby the plaintiff undertook to pay -511., the rent then dne, as well as the fixture rent of the farm, he having the occupation of the farm until his debt was satisfied. That agreement recited the fact that the plaintiff had paid 511. odd for Bennett's rent, and that that debt had since been reduced by a subsequent 'dealing between the plaintiff and Bennett to the sun of 241. Odd; and it also contsined a statement that Bennett had sold to tbe plaintiff two cows for 271 odd. A few days priGr to the signing of this agreement the farm was let to the plantiff and Bennett jointl, iand the plaintiff after-
wards occupied and mansged the lansd. The cows remaiued on the farm till the folowing Christmas, and down to that time Bennett had the milk. About Christmas the plaintiff removed them to another, farm occupied by him at *Welford, and kept them there till February. In that month Bennett applied to Gardner to know 'what olaim he made upon them, and on that occasion le made -out an account of ntey due to him, and said that if Bennett paid that amount they might go back to the -other farm. Bennett also stated that he h:.d made a charge against him for the keep of the cows ; but Gardner represented that the charge which he had mnade was for the milk which Bennett had had, and not for the keep. Shortly after this Bennett, at an early hour one mnorning, removed the cows from a paddock where they were and sold them. The plaintiff found them at the Lut.terworth station in the custody of a lad, whom he caused to he apprehended and taken before magistrates upon the charge of stealing them ; but that charge was dismissed. The defendant afterwards, aud wNith a knowledge of that fact, became .the purchaser; and it was liow contended on his behalf that the cows in fast never were sold by Bennett -to the plaintiff, %but-that tho transaction which took place in the sttorney'se'ffice was eolourable only, the real intention of the parties being to protect the cows, which were 3ennett's property, from his creditors. Several witnesses having been examined on both sides
The learned Judge in the end left to the jury the question which version of te ltransaction they believed, andtbe jury, -after somne deliberation, found a verdict for the plaintiff:[)amages, 1.31.

James Watts Mackay, aged 35, schoolmaster, was indicted -for an assault, with intent-to commit a rape, and in another count of the indictment with an indecent assault, upon 'Frances White, at Kingsthorpe, on the 25th of December.
Mr. Mere wetlher conducted the prosecution ; Mr. O'Brien defended the prisoner.
The prosecutrix in this case was a girl of about 16 years eof age, who had formerly -been - pupil in thie prisoner's school, and had latterly worked as a servanit in his house, .ard it-appeared from her statement-Chat on several occasions when shle was a pupil -in the prisoer's school some years ao he had taken very indecentliberties with he-, and that lately, upon her coming to workin 'his house, lie had been guilty of similar conduct. The prisoner was a married man witl-c hildren, but the prosecutrix -did not appear to have made auy complaint respecting his behaviour towards her inor to have exhibited azy disinclination to he employed in his house. he did not, however, -live -there as a servant, but went to work during-the day.
Lord CAPrroELL thought there was noevidence-to go to the jnry upon the first counit, but-left it to-them to say whether 'the prisoner had been guiSty, of an indecent assault.

Mr. -Merewether prosecuted; and Mr. Matkham defended the prisonier.
Mr. Vernon is a6aelicitor in 2Nosthampton, and the prisoner was in his evrvice front Michaelmas -e the 11th cf -February (ast. During that period she was considered a good servuet, and gmeat confidemce ws placed in her, so that durwig-the absence of her maister and mistress she was -required to watch the other servants. Vhile,ke remained mn the service no susptoion attache.d to her, and she left of her own aCce-d, in pt,susnce of a noti6e whieai -she had -given ; -but many thi&Igs were xnissed,-wine, 1preseryes, mnlIcemeat, sas wel as articles of wearing:2pparel, -and thel -boxes of some otherser,va;tswere seatcheiL Afteraheleft, howevev, some-i0formatior, was obtaWued, in consequence o£ whbich ant officer west 'to her mnother's 'hovse at Mortor, 'inckney, and the-e, in the prisoner's ho-xes, found a great Part of the missing properti:, and also several tetters agned " Williamn .," sodL dAted f-rom D%ventrty. It turned out that these letters ihad beeas written by an attorney's clerk at -Daventry fr one 'PWilliam Oiborn, who kespt A fishmonger's sbop there, and who had dictated the ,contents to tUe wrifer. lyve of them were read in ,evidence for the purpose of shoving that the writer had re,ceived wine &from the )risoner. They began, " My dear Lizzie ;" and one eontained these words, " I received the bottle, and enjoyed it witk ily friend. I went oUt hunting yesterday and had asevere f11-' i weuld rather hae fallen into your arats than where I did." The otber contained the following -" Make yessrself,contented till after Christmas, and then I hope we shall live comfoetAble and happy to-
ptJier. I felt rather queer tfus morning; I wvanted somei
tf tat old port." It aleo contained a .statement that if )r. and lfrs. Vernon would be out on the following Sen. day he would come over and see her. The prisoner herself at the timo her boxes were searched had gone to London, and intended, according to a stsatetnt made by herself to
lave left shortly for Australia.
The jury found her Gutlty, and the learned JUDGE sentenced her to 12 months' imprisonment with hard labour.
John ilrley, a gamekeeper, in the service of Lord Winhilsea, was indicted for wounding Thomas Stephens AUlen, with intent to do him some grievous bodily harm.
Mr. Cockle eonducted the prosocution; Mr. Macaulay Q. C., and Mr. Mtanusell the defence.
It appeared that the prosecutor, Mr. Allen, who carried on bnsiness as an auctioneer at Little Weldon, and was a
grd;D of pte pour and constable of his parir, went out
on the night ot tbo!Dlnt of Deoem-ber last with his gun to shoot pheas'Ants 'In tLord Winchilseia' wqods, and that while so etrployed-he received two gunshot wonnds, one in the arrm P:d the other in tb. back. There was no doubt that the prisoese, 'who ws ot that night watching with his son and a manu Xmcned Wade, had inflicted those wounds ; bunt it appeared from the statements which the prisoner made shortly after the occurrence that he had fired under the irme8ssion that there was a large party of poachers in the wood, and under the apprehension of danger, he having heard several shots fired, and having perceived shot fyiyng about bis head just before. His stateinsst was tha he had fired in the direction whence the sh-' proceeded, but that he did not know whether he had hit aL
one, and that he believed that he saw three men in the wood.
Mr. MACAULAY, at the close of the case for the prosecution, asked the learned judge whether he thought there was any evidence of the felonious intent charged in the indictment.
Lord CAMPBELL expressed his opinion that the charge of felony could not be supported; but he thought that the defendant was guilty of the misdemeanour of unlawfully wounding.
Mr. MjiC.AIULAY said that upon that question he was prepared to add some evidence which would tend to confirm the belief of Milley that there was a party of three or four poachers in the wood on the night in question; and that, perhaps, under those cizoumstancea, the defendant might be considered as entitled to an acquittal upon the ground that he was only acting in self-defence.
Lord CA'SIPBELL thou?ht that the firing of the gun could not be aLltogether justifed under the, circumstances; and, the learned counsel having submitted to that opinion, the prisoner was found guilty of the misdemeanour of unlawfully wounding.
The Rev. Mr. Hatton, Lord Winchilsea's brother was then examined as to the prisoner's character, and LO expressed the highest opinion of him as a humane man.
A letter from Lord Wincohisea, who wvas prevented from attendin personaly by an attack of gout, was also read, boeaing te highest testimony to the character of the prisoner, who had been in the service of the family for upwards of 40 years.
The prosecutor and the jury concurred in recommending him to mercy; and
Lord C s,sIsBELL said that he felt justified in sentencing him to one day's imprisonment only, as he fully believed that when he fired the shot he was acting strictly under a sense of dutv.
Thomas StephensAllen, the prosecutor in the last case, was then placed at the bar upon the charge of night poaching.
Mr. MACAUL,AY, however, said that he would not offer ny evidence against the accused, because, even if the jury should be led to doubt whether on the night in question Mr. Allen was the only person out shooting in the wood, the existence of any doubt on that subject would entitle him to an acqu_ttal, as the offence with which he was charged consisted in the being out armed, to the number of th7ee or more, with intent to destroy game; and it might also be, that if there were other poachers in the wood, Mr. Allen was not in company with them
Lord C , PBELL entirely approved the course which had been taken. He had no doubt that Milley was mistaken in supposing that thero were other persons with Allen;- and tne defendant was entitled to be acquitted, thou,gh it was greatly to be lamented that a person in his position should have set so had an excample as to go out by night, even singly, for the purpose of shooting pheasants in Lord Winchilses's woods, and he hoped that this occurrence would be a lesson to him for the remainder of his days.
A verdict of HVot G4aits. was then taken.
Chinese Humanity.
CHINESB HUMANITY.
TO THE EDITOl OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-To represent the Chinese as models of civilization, as Lord Derby and his friends have done, is one of the most extraordinary instances of the lengths to which faction will go. A glance at the punishments of the inner barbarians will be sufficient to prove this. What can be more ferocious and inhuman? First, there is the wooden cage, which consistsof two large pieces of wood fitting into one another, and having three openings, into which the head, or the head and a hand, or the head and both hands, according to the severity of the sentence, are put. This punishment is so severe-for the wretch condemned to it has to sustain on his shoulders a weight of 2001b., without any possibility of relief-that it is certain death if inflicted for more than a very few days. Next comes beating with bamboo canes,-a process which sometimes kills after 15 blows. Then, flaying, crushing limbs, and tearing out the tendons of the feet. Strangling and beheading are the capital punishments, to wlhich may be added, though, it is said, not often practised, the penalty by which a crinsial is placed between two boards and sawed in two from head to foot. Starving to death is sometimes practised, the culprit being buried in the earth up to the neck, and there left to die; or he is fixed in the wooden cage and fed with daily diminishing rations of rice, till he dies on the last grain, as the horse did on his last straw. In 1846 4,000 persons were beheaded in the province of Canton out of a population of 9,000,000.
Mr. Meadows, the interpreter of the English Embassy in China in 1852, saw at Canton an execution which he afterwards described. The criminals were insurgents who had fallen into the hands of the Tartar officials. The place of execution was a low room, from which the heads of persons previously executed had not been removed. A fire of sandal-wood burnt before the shed where sat the mandarins who were to superintend the executions, and iiterposed its fragrancy between their nobility and the stench of the decomposing heads. The criminals were brought in, some borne in bakets and tumbled out on the ground, where they lay paraly7ed ivith fear or from the effects of torture infficted duriDg their trial and imprisonment. They were then placed in order, in a kneeling position, with their faces towards the ground, a man standing behind each, and grasping him tightly by his bound hands. Another, in case of resistance, sei7ed the queuc, and pulled in the opposite direction to keep the neck extended. Ail being thus prepared, the executioner came forward, a common sabre his weapon, which he held with both hands, standing with his legs somewhat apart, ready for the word. In three minutes 33 bodies were headless, aUl but the first completely severed with one blow. From one to another the executioner leapt, body and sword acting with the precision of a machine, and dealing a death-
bow at ever Jump. One criminal remained, and for him a more awful death was appointed. He was a man of powerful frame, in the prime of life, and had surrenderel himself to he ffiial tosae hs wfe nd amiy,who were in their hands, from the torture. They took and bound him to a wooden cross fixed against the wall. The flesh was then cut from his forehead, breast, and extremities-a horrible process, which occupied five minutes, and was yet rapidlypr formed. The unhannv mRn +I,Ahn, td,.-.- S_A_A- *O. -

The School Rate Question.
THE SCHOOL RATE QUESTIO2.
TO TRE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The zeal with which Sir J. Pakington's Bill is pressed forward seems to me a reason why those who value England as it is should inquire what is likely to result if a similar BiU were carnied into effect all over the country.
I am anxious to keep the educatioi of the people in connexion with the religious teachers of the people. I think that a rate wiU in time dry up the streams of voluntary contributions to schools, and as a consequence lessen charity. The voluntary labourers wiU lose their interest in that which they cannot mould and influence. Thus the cement of society, the most necessary tissues of our English life, wiU be weakened. Much of what is done best in our schools cannot bh purchased by a money payment. Their characteristicfreedom and variety, their spontaneous action will be replaced by the uniform impress of the State pattern. We do not wish to have our schools managed by a set of " Luke Sharps," whose main object wiU be to prepare their scholars for the annual examination. The question is not whether arithmetic can be taught separately from the Catecbism. but whether our teachers be modest, laborious, trustworthy, Christian men. Such teachers cannot be reared simply by money payments from the State. Large sums were spent on Kneller-hall, the teacher was a most fit and able iman, the result was a failure.
A system that suits America miay not suit a, country where we wish the inhabitants to be trained in habitual honour and obedience to all that are set over them. We ahrink from tbat want of social connexion, that recklessness about human sufisring, that idolizing of material results, which some travelers find fault with on the other side of the Atlantic. In achieving moral results we can only effectually help those who will help themselves. I desire, therefore, to see tl-e present operations of the Committee of Council on Education enlarged and strengthened, and I think that on social and isolitical, as wei as or religious grounds, a heavy reeensibiity reste en owners of property wiho decline to do what they can to help local boards of education o profit by the advantages whiich are now 'offered to schools for the peer from the Parliamentary_grant.

The sum of 1,754, already stated for the first three fortnights of the half-year, added to the 404., as above, snakes a total expended to Feb-ruary22 of 1,580?., aS against 1,54. for the corresponding four fortnights of the previous year.
LAINCASHIRE AND YORKSHIRE.
The half-yearly meeting was held yesterday at Man*hester, Mr. W. Stuart presiding.
An abstract of the report has appeared in he Tlimes.
The CHAIXRMrAh then moved the adoption of the report and confirmation of the directors' proceedingg, After a brief summary of the statistics of the comn y's position and progress, as gven in the report, he alluded to the negotiations with the lackburn Company. The directors had given their earnest attention to this sabject, hoping that some course would be adopted which would satisfy the expectations of the Blackburn Co pny without entailng a heavy loss on the Lancashire and Yorkshire. Those anticipations had not been realzed, the Blackburn directors having introduced a Bill into Parliament for a new line
between Manchester and Bolton, and also an extension i from Chatburn to join the Little North-Western. The pretext for this opposition line and unnecessary expenditure of 5oO,0001. to 800,000L was that the Blaekburn Company had not been allowed their fair share of traffic, and that their interests had been sacrificed. An offer had since been made by this comnpany and the East Lancashire to
urchase the line on terms far exceeding its present value. That had been declined by the Blackburn Company, but he believed the negotiations were not entirely abandoned.
Mr. EHORNBY.-I beg leave to contradict that.
The CHAIBR3UN said he should regret the matter the more if the negotiations failed owing to a foregone conclusion.
Mr. Aunt's (director) seconded the motion.
Mr. W. RA.,wsoN moved, as an amendment, that the report be not adopted, and that the dividend be at the rate of 5U per cent., leaving 43,0001 to be carried over.
Mr. Ho\BmY seconded the motion.
The amendment was then put and negatived by a great majority, only three hands being held up in its favour.
Mr. HOBNBY then said he should oppose that portion of the report referring to the Blackburn Company. He asserted that there were no longer any negotiations between the Lancashire and Yorkshire and the Blackburn Company, and believed it was never contemplated by Mr. Stuart to offer fair terms to them. He concluded by moving an amendment, for the omission from the report of that portion relating to the application of the Blackburn Company to Parliament, and desiring the directors not to interfere, directly or indirectly, with that application.
Mr. MITCHELL seconded the amendment.
This amendment was also lost, only three hands being shown in its favour, and the report was then adopted.
Mr. RANNwsoN protested against this decision.
A resolution vwas then unanimously adopted declaring a dividend of 24 10s. per share on the 1004 stock, and the respeetive dividends due on the guaranteed shares.
The retiring dircetors and auditors were re-elected.
Resolutions were carried authorizing the directors to oppose all Bills in Parliament opposed to their interests, and giving them power to enter into such arrangements with the East Lancashire Railway to carry out the amalpmation as may be necessary.
A special meeting to raise new capital was then held.
The CIIAIRM:IAN explained that it vas necessary to raise this additional capital, and moved tbat, in lieu of shares which had been forfeited and merged in the general capital, a new stock should be issued to the amount of 787,5004, in shares of 9l. each.
After some objections from Mr. ENWISLE and Mr. R,A0SON, the resolution was agrecd to, and the meeting separated.
BLACKBURN.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Fri. day at Blackburn; Mr. W. H. Hornby in the chair.
The report, which was adopted, showed that the traffic on the line had almost remained stationary from 1851 to December, 155, during which time it had been worked by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the receipts having been 20.3151. for the half-year ending December, 1851, against 22,9611. in December, 1.855. The receipts for the traffic had increased since the line had been worked by the directors, those for the half-year ending December, 1856, amounted to 25.729L, showing an increase of 2,76St
over same period of 1855. The total receipts for the year 1855 amounted to 44,7:374, and for 1856 49.4711, showing an increase of 4,7341, or about 10-6 per cent. The directors regretted that they could not pay out of the balance of revenue now in hand the half-year's dividend on the B preference shares ; but they expressed their confident belief that if the Act of Parliament for which they were now applying was passed they would he enabled at once to resume the payment of dividends on these slhares, and they did not doubt that the ordinary capital would also soon participate in the general benefit. The only serious opposition anticipated to the Bill was from the Lancasgire and Yorkshire and East Lancashire companies, the principal landowners on both extensions being favourable to it. The report stated that if furtherproof were needed of the disregard by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company of their engagements with the Blackburn Company it was to be found in the agreement lately entered into by them with the East Lancashire Company for an amalgamation of their undertak-ings, without in any way consulting their interests on the subject. The capital account showed that 1,060,2801. had been received, and 1,039,2461. expended, leaving a balance in favour ofthe company of 21,0341. The revenue account for the halfyear ending 31st December amounted to 25, 7301., and the disbursements to 12,2321., leaving a balance of 13,4974 To this was added 7,1621. from the preceding half-year, making
20,6591. Out of this w as deducted 11,6994 interest on loans,aOnd 71.2411. for Parliamentary expenses, leaving a
WARRLNGTON AND STOCKPORT.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Warrington on Friday; hr. W. C. Fosbery in the chair.
The report stated that the receipts during the half-year amounted to 3,8421., showing an increase of 8044 over the corresponding period of 1855. Under the new arrangement with the South Junction and Altrincham Railway Company the worlking expenses were considerably rcduced. The directors looked forward to a steady increase of both goods and passenger traffic when the resources of the line were more fully developed under the existing agreement with the 'Scuth Junction U-many The total receipts on capital account amuounted to234,07374, and the expenditure,262,9981., leaving a balance against the company of 28,9254 There were further liablisties estimated to amount to 21,0004., nnsking 49, 925. The estimated asets amounted to 23,50014, leaving a balance against the company of 26,4251. The revenue account shlowed the receipts, for the half-year end'1 1tof December to be 3,8411 and the expense 2,b544,'leaving a balance of 1,2871. The inxe. t,In amounted to 1L419)L 1- - - tr o on

The CHAIRMAN explained that the cause of their expenditre being so heavy was in consequence of the Stockport branch, which was now abandoned.

bNORFOLKI.
The half-yearly nieetiL g Of this comrpaniy was held on Friday at the London Taevn, Mr. Rh. Til in the chair.
The report stated that the amount credited tothe Norfolk Company by the Eastern Coa.nties Company of 49,0741., as their proportion of the joint ,earnings, in accordanoe with the agreenment for amalgamati;Sn, would enable the propuietorg to declare a dividend of .21. per cent. uspon the ordinary stock of the company, leaaing a balance of 1,353LThere were some items in the accomit of fbe last half-year's working of the associated railway. and aOso in former accounts, whichwere objected to by the direct,.rs. The board of the Eastern Counties Company had brougtt forward a large claim against the company for expenditu.e on works upon the Norfolk line. The directors disputed 01ae amoInn or this claim, and under any caicumstance,3 they &catended that the Norfolk Company were only chargeable % ith, interest upon the outlay when ascertained. A pro ao X had been made to the Eastern Counties Company to refer LNOth questions to arbitration. The report of Messes. Harvey a,sd ,impson stated that the total amount of capital upon which' in-terest and dividends werc payable was 2,217,4401., and, thev after carefully examining the stock, debhe, And
share ledgers and bond accounts, were of opinion that tLe total amount of each description was correctly stated, and
fuly confirmed the sttement in the revenue and capitall accounts issued by the directors.
The CHrAiR' If entered at some length into the working of the lines, with a view to show that the Eastern Counties Company should work the associated lines at 43 per cent., iDstead of 46 per cent., of the receipts. If it had cost the Eastern Counties Company 50 per cent. to work them it was their own fault, because they had only to improve their management in order to reduce the expenses to at least 46 per cent., being the amount allowed under the agreement. He adverted to the position of the East Suffolk lines and to a former recommendation of the Norfolk Company to the
Eastern Counties Company that they should accept the offer ' of those lines for merely the cost of the Act of Parliament, but they rejected the offer.
Mr. BWDER contended that the accounts of the Eastern Counties Company had been cooked to show * loss on working the Tilbury and Southend hne, that the cattle traffio from Lowestoft had realized a profit to the Eastern Counties Company of 55 per cent. on the working, and that if the asociated lines were worked properly tho traffic on them could be cxrried At Iless cost than 46 per cent. of the gross receipts.
Resolations were passed adopting the report, declaring a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per Lnnum for the halfyear, and re-electing the retiring directors and auditor.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman.
EASTERN UNION.
The half-yeaxrl mneeting of this comnpanly was held on Friday at Radileys Hotel, Mr. Cobbold in the chair.
The report, an abstract of which hxs appeared in X2.c Times, was taken as read.
The CuASms , in moving the adoption of the report, congratulated the shareholders on having for the second time doubled their dividend, and they bad no reason to doubt that the progress of the traffic would continue. The EAstern Counties directors had stated tbat, because they could not work the traffic at 46 per cent., the actual cost being 50 per cent., it had entailed a IOES on them of 11,3201. a-year; but he did not see how they could call that a loss; it was merely receiving less profit. With regard to the proposed Colchester and Pitsea line, a more unwarrantable attack on establshed property could not be conceived. The line was not wanted nd could not pay. A loan of 200,0001. had been advanced to them by the Eastern Counties Company to redeem the preference stock at the time of the amalgamation, but it was very desirable they should get rid of that obligation, and pay it off as soon as possible.
Sir S. BzIqOLD, M.P., seconded the motion.
In reply to Mr. SN= it was stated that the Eastern Union had objected to the accounts rendered them by the Eastern Counties Company for several half-year ; they objected to payments to the Blackwall Company, to the loss on the Hnrwich steamboats. to the rent of the pepper warehouses at Blackwall, and other things being cbarged against them, but the matters in dispute would be referred to arbitration.
Mr. WEBB, an auditor, explained that various items in the former Accounts of the Eastern Counties to a large amount had been objected to, and he thought there was a sum of nearly 3,0001. on the past half-year that ought to come to them.
The report was then adopted.
Mr. D. SEYmouos complained of the way in which the Eastern Counties directors managed the traffic. He concluded by moving a resolution autborizing the directors to deal iththbe Bill before Parliament in reference to the Pitses line as they might deem expedient to the interests of the united lines, in the full hope that the Eastern Counties would Act in the true spirit of their arrange3nent.
The motion was seconded and carried, and the dividend recommended by the directors was declared.
The retiring directors, Messrs. Cayley, Cobbold, Grayston, and Hart, and the retiring auditor, J. Head, were reelected.
The proceedings then terminated.
LOWESTOFT AND BECCLES.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Mondayat Lowestoft- Mr. E. Leathesin the chair.
The accounts showes a blance in hand of 1,7931.
TheCsrjmir,vs, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that he had gone over the East Suffolk line, and the forward state of the works had greatly surprised him. From Balesworth to Benhall, two miles beyond Saxmundbam, the vork lay through a stiff clay, and, although the past winter had not been very favourable, the progress made was astonishing. As for the rest of the line, the work which remained to be done was quite trifling, there being 10 miles ready for sleepers On the present Lowestoft and Beccles line the land had been arranged for.
ir. GOVwncG seconded the adoption of the report, which was unanimously agreed to.
The proceedings closed with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors. -
GREAT SOUTHERN AND WESTERN.
The half-yearly meeting of this cempany was held at Dublin on Saturday; Sir E. M'Donnell in the chair.
The report, an abstract of which has appeared in 27ic Times, was read.
The CHAIRMAN explained the various items in the accounts, and that from the increase of traffic and the proposed opening of the Roscrea and Parsonstowvn, theWexford and Bagenalatown, and the llarney and Tralee Railwrays, a large additional quantity of rolling stock would be requiredan*d additional works on the line, making together a sum of 250,000L., for which they now sought Parliamentary powers to raise.
A long discussion ensued on various matters connected vith the affairs of the company and its position with respect to neighbouring companies, after which resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring the dividend at ithe rate of 6 per cent, per annum on the ordinary ahares of Ithe company, increasing the remuneration of the directors from 1,5001 to 3,000L a-year, and subscribing a certainsum to the Roscrea and Parsonstown Railwy.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman.
NORTH YORKSHIRE AND CLEVELAND.
About eight miles of this line, from the Picton Junction on the North-Eastern to Stokesley, as well as a short branch to Swainby, were opened for general traffic on Tuesday, having been opened by the directors on the previous day. A further portion of the line to Kildale is now in progress and is expected to be opened in September, and when completed the line wil form a junction with the Whitby and Pckering line, at Grosmont The line will be chiefly used for mineral traffic, and has been constructed with the view of opening one of the most extensive iron and stone districts in England, which has hitherto had no railway com3munication whatever.
WEST LONDON.
The committee appointed at the last half-yearly meeting of this company state that they have consulted counsel of emiinence with reference to the award of fr. Hawkshaw, who concur in opinion that such award is invalid, and contrary to law, and may be set aside on the application of any of the shareholders to a court of equity. Other questions of great importance have arisen as to the right of the preference shareholders to the surplus aseets and proerty of the company, to the exclusion of the ordinary shareholders Without some decision of a competent tribunal in a friendly proceeding, or without some compromise between the various classes of shareholders, the committee have arrived at the conclusion that the capital of the ordinary shareholders is in dancer of being wholly annihilated. They therefore recommend the shareholders to purme the course advised by counsel, and to obtain the opinion of a competent court with as httle delay and expense as practicable.
NORTHERN BENGAL
It is proposed to construct a branch railway from the Rajmahal rlie of the East ludian Railway in a northerly direction to Dinajpore and Darjeeling, for the accommodation of the districts of Rungpore, hfalda, and Pnrneah. The total length of the railway proposed to be constructed will depend upon the route selected, and will range between 200 and 300 miles The promoters state that the proposed lines would accommodate a country of great traffc and vast resources Onegreat adva-tage of the linewould be that of affording rapid acoess from Cl cutta to Dajeeling, which, it is sted, enjoys a climate equal to that of England, and would command a first-class trafEc in consequence of its healthy position. The cost of the railway is estimated at about 9,000L per mile. From the report of Dr. Campbell, of DarjeeUng, it apears that the population of that place is 50000; that the climate is as healthy as any in the world and very greeable, and is more favourable to the health of children than that of England; and that the hills are well suited for the growth of tea and coffee. He states that the districts through which the proposed lines are intended to pass yield a revenue of 450,0001 per annum, and have a population of more than 4,000,000. He represents labour as abundant and cheap, and the country as abounding in produce and materials
CORK AND YOUGHAL
In the Account of the proceedings at the meeting of this company which appeared in lTe 2imc of Tuesday, it was stated that the contractors had told the chairman "that an outlay of about 5,0001. per mile would put the line between Dunkettle and Midleton into a condition to receive the rails " it should have been that the outlay of 5,0001 upon the entire extnt of that section of the line would suffice.

The race requires little description. The pace wassevere throughout. From start to finish Emigrant bore hiscolours prominently in advance, and taking a line to himself was at times far a-head of his opponents. M\inos seemed beaten on passing the stand the first time, and on quitting the race course he nexrly came down. Escape layin the middle of the ruck until after clearing Beecher's-brook the second time, when hewas hopelearlybeaten. Tbeaccidents, so farasweovere enabled to ascertain them amid the confusion which revailed, and during the short time which was allowed us between the decision of the race and the departure of the express train, were few and, with one exception, not of a senous cbaracter. On coming on to the racecourse the first time Forest Queen cannoned against Star of the West, and knoeked him down. He was soon remounted, but refusin at the lane was stopped. Weatbercock refused at the third fence, but was soon righted and lay of until reaching the canal bridgo turn, when hedrew forward andwon afterwards took second place. Albatross feU on the racecourse and, it is said, broke her thigh. Red Rose also was reported to have met with an accident. After clearing Beecher's-brook the second time Westminster took the leAd, Emigrant, who was keeping his own particular track, running very wide, not far tn his wake, Little Charley and Dangerous being third and fourth. At the lst fence but one before reaching the racecourse Westminster dropped back and Emigrant again took a long lead lIe was first over the last fli2ht of hurdes, Dangerous being second, Weathercock third, Westminster and Treachery next. Emigrant gaUoped in an easy winner by two lengths. At a ide interval behind Weathercock were Treachery, third, Dangerous fourth, and Westminster fiftb, close together. Bebind them, a long wa3y, cameJean du Qiesue, Lady Arthur, a%nd Forest Queen. The next Int. consisting of Casse Cou, Minos, Squire of Bensham, and Garry Owen, trotted in. The succeeding division did not pass the stand, and the last animals we noticed were Escape and Midge. There were others behind them, but we could not see them, becuse, lik-e the Spanish fleet, they were not in sight. The ra ce was run in 10 minute.s 5 seconds.
The ground, which comprised grass, ploughed and h.nrrowed land, was In good goimg order.
