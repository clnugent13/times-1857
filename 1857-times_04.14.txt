M,ond6y Evening.
The further large arrival of Australian gold tos ay by the Royal Charter caused the funds to open '1iss morning at a fresh advance of an eighth per .ent. Sulbsequently the market showed increased I rmness, but this was met by a succession of sales, N bich caused some return of heaviness. The first 1t1 ansaCtions in Consols for money were at 92i to 93, wbhence they went to 93 to J. A slight relapse thin occurred, and the closing prices were 92k for money, and 93i to @ for the 7th of May. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 91i tot, New Three per Cents., 91 ] to 92; Exchequer-bonds, 9"i to J; India Bonds, 4x. to 2s. discount; and Exehequer-bills (March), 2s. discount to 2s. premivum.
There was a temporary absence of pressure for money to-day in the Stock-Exchange, and also in the discount-marktet and at the Bank.
Foreign sernties opened with firmness, but there was subsequently a slight reaction. Mexican was rather more freely dealt ;D2 and was well supported to the close. The transactions for money took place at23ft; and for the account at 234, J, i, and
In Turkish Six per Cents. the bargains were at 94k, i, i, and i. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were negotiated at 100 and i. The general operations comprised-Brazilan five per Cents., 99k; the Fonir-and-a Half per Cents., New, 99; Peruviasi Four-a-4d-a-Half per Cents., 77; Portuguese 'Ihree Per Cents., for account, 45; Russian Fourand-a- alf per Cents., 95i; and Sardinian Five per Cents., 90k and X.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 90c. for money, and 70f. 15c. for the end of the month, showing a further improvement of threee,gbtbs per cent.
The corn-market was steady this morning at the rates of Monday last.
The amount- of gold by the Royal Charter is 128,W0 ounces and 13,000 sovereigns, making a total of 525,U001. The Light of the Age brings 6,500 ounces, valued at 26,0001. Sinmultaneously with these arrivals the receipts of silk and tea from China are almost equally valuable, the cargoes of the two vessels announced on Saturday-the Palmerston and the John Robinson-being worth more tban 400,0001.
About 47,0001. in Australian gold was taken to the Bank to-day.
The letters from Paris state that some remittances of sovereigns are taking place from Paris to London. During the last week 70,000 are said to have been sent rid Boulogne. It appears that at the reduced price offered for gold by the Bank of France they no longer afford any profit on melting. The pressure for money i still severe, and on the Bourse the prospect of new issues of railway obligations tends to check the recovery in Rentes. Although the subscription lists for the Roman railways have been eagerly filled, it haa been found desirable to give an extension of timae for the payment of the deposit. The Russian railway scheme, notwithstanding the reduction of the amount to be offered in Paris, promises to prove a failure. In the face of all the efforts to impart a fictitiousvalue tothe shares persons are ready to sell them in any quantities at 25f. to 30f. per share premium, although the allotment will not be made before the end of the month. It is mentioned as a singular fact that the chief foreign demand for these shares at St. Petersburg has been from bankers at Constantinople, but many of these persons are merely Russian agents, who are probably acting according to order. With the view of helping the scheme the Russian Government, it is said, have given the anticipated directions to the various banks in Russia to make advances on the shares to the extent of two-thirds of their value. It is still asserted that an attempt will be made to raise part of the capital in London at the end of the preseut month, but it is added that the amount will be less than was at first intended, the Government probably being willing to take whatever they can get.
The question of the renewal of the charter of the Bank of France is now under discussion. The Government are said to contemplate granting a term, of 60 years, upon condition that the Bank shall
double its present capital of 3,650 0001., and employ I the additional amount thus raise& by investing it im Government securities. According to the Presse these securities are to consist of Treasury Bonds, but it is believed in private quarters that they are to be 3 per cent. Rentes.
Owing to the last accounts from India of the failure of the local Government to raise a 5 per cent. loan, an impression is entertained by. some persons that a subscription for the requizte sum wfill be opened on this side. The difficulty in India, however, is likely to prove merely temporary, and there is reason to suppose that any help which may be accorded by the authorities on this side will be limited to such sums as may be obtained in anticipation from subscribers to guaranteed railways.
The telegraphic uotations of the Indian exchanges show that the transmission of silver to the East will steadily continue, and It is estimated that the shipments by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Indus on the 20th wiiU be 600,0001.
The 70,0001. of gold brought by the Africa from Now York to-day is all on account of the Bank of France. The conunercial advices on this occasion, however, continue to desoribe an increasing firmness in thc. rate of exchange, which will probably lead to a resumption of specie shipments before the lapse of many weeks. The stock-market was heavy, and most of the principal railway shares had experienced a further decline. Erie were quoted 52k, Reading 78, New York Central 88 to J, Panama 94, and Ilrnois Central 131k to 132; the bonds 1021. The report of the Illinois Central Company, just issued, showed the gross earnings for 1856 to have been 495,0001. against 306,0001. in 1855. The working expenses were 58 per cent. The total land sales for the year had reached 3,023,0001., making the aggregate of allsales up to the 31st of December 2,142,0001. Out of the original grant ot 2,595,000 acres the proportion disposed of is 865,211, leaving 1,729,789, which, at the average price realized last year, are estimated at 5,677,0001. Tn the import-market there was no material alteration, but the demand for silk goods, owing to the advance in price, was dull. From the city of Mexico the last dates were to the 2d of March. Some new difficulty had arisen between the Gxovernment and the British Charg6 d'Aflaires on the Barron question. It was also said that the claim arising out of the robbery of 48,0001. from the British Consulate at San Luis had been refused. Renewed apprehensions were entertained of an invasion of the provinces of Sonora and Lower California by organized bands of Americaus from San Francisco, and strong forces had been sent to those districts.
The trade reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week show a limitedbusiness, but steady prices. At Manchester, stocks being moderate with a fair supply of orders, full rates have been demanded. The Birmingham advices state that the iron-market is well maintained, and that in the other occupations of the place there is good employment. Notwithstanding the high rates of interest, the quarter]y payments have been extremely well uet. At Nottingham and in the woollen districts there has been partial dulness, while in the Irish linen-markets the demand hla beensatisfactory.
According to the circular of M. Arles Dufour, of Lyons, the tendency to reaction in the European silk-markets continues, and the anticipated orders froni America have as yet beenunnimportant. Many holders still keep back their silk under the persuasion that another short crop will be exDerienced. Thus far, however, thc aspect of the muliervytree
is very favourable, and in some forward di-tricin where the leaves are already begmining to green the seed will be set to be hatched soonafter Easter. The progress of the hatching and breeding will be a sub. rect of anxietyr not only among the cultivators and
the peasants of the countrEy, but by all politiciansi and financiers, as well as the general crowrd of speculators on the Paris Bourse.
The European and American Steam Company, the recent purchaser of the eight large Ships of the General SCrew Company, have is8ued a report preparatory to their meeting on the 22d. From this it appears that the slips in question were paid for by a urrender of shares in the General Screw Company representing 223,1361., and cash to the amount of 96,6141. Every care has been taken in preparng them for sea, and their carrying capcitny ha been Incresed by spar decks. An additional cost of 83,6301. Wi thus have to be met, which, with 81,6141. represented by a bonus of 2& 7s, 6d. on the hare of the General Screw Company, will make the total capital of the concem 484,994t., to which amount the agfeement of- Memsrs.

shareholders is to apply. To raise the requisite funds it is proposed to sue preference 6 per cent.' ares at the rate of one new share of 91. for every two shaes now held, with no further participation into profits, but with a right of exchange at any time in ordinary shares. The services of the fleet commenced on the 6th inst. by the departure of the Golden Fleece for Hamburg, whence she is to sail on the 20th for Brazil, touching at Southampton on the 24th. A line from Antwerp to Brazil is to be opened on the 30th of* May, and the New York line from Bremen vid Southampton on the 26th of ApriL
The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have conprised three vessels-one for Port Phillip, one for Auckland, and one for Portland Bay, with au aggregate capacity of 3,783 tons. The rates of freight have exhibited little variation.
In the general business of the port of Londoa during the past week there has en diminished activity. The number of vessels reported inwards was 212, being 64 less thaa in the previous week. The number cleared outward was 120, including 16 in ballast, showing a decrease of 25. The number of ships on the berth loading for the Australiau colonies is 45, being 2 less than at the Lat account. Of these 7 are for Adelaide, 3 for Geelong, 1 for Hobart Town, 3 for Launceston, 6 for New Zealand, 12 for Port Philip, 2 for Portland Bay, I for Perth, 9 for Sydney, and 1 for Swan River; 5 of them were entered outward in January and 12 in February.
It is understood that at the approaching meeting of the Northern of France Hailway the board will recommend the construction of several branches of considerable importance, including the line from Paris to Soissons. A transversal line from Rouen to St. Quentin, passing through Amiens, is also proposed, which will bring St. Quentin and the industrious and imnportant ditrict of which it is the centre into direct communication with the two seaports of Boulogne,vid Amiens, andlIavre, ridAinlens and Rouen. A line is likewise projected from Btoulogne to Calais. This will shorten the distance between Calais and Paris, and bring Calais back to its true topographical relation with the capital. There is an extensive mineral district in the neighbourhood of Boulogne, and the line from Boulogne to Calais may be £o laid out as to traverse it, and bring it into close comniunication with the port of Boulogne. Should these various projects be approved by the meeting steps will betaken to obtain concessions from the Government, and to provide for their gradual execution.
The annexed is in contradiction of some statements just made with regard to the Bank of London:-
" Bank of london, Threadneedle-street, city, April 13.
"Sir,-A statement hving appeared in the columns of ore of your weekly contempoianes (the Atlas) to the effect that the directors of this bank aredebtors to the bank,' that I they became directors in order to avail themselves of their position to secure facilities of credit denied to them on their instrinsic merits,' and connecting the name of Sir John Shelley with the statement, wfith the evident inten. on of leading the public to infer that he is indebted to this bank, I beg te favour of your affording me the opportunity for the instant contradiction of so fse and injurious a statement,
*Sir John She31ey is not indebted one shilling to this bank; on the contrary, the bank has a considerable balance standing to the credit of his account - and, with respct to the unworthy motive attributed to the other direceors in joining the board, the best reply will be that no director of this bank bas, or can have, an advance upon anything but first-class bils of exchange, or upon such convertible security as would be readily taken by the Bank of England or by any London banker.
"Sir John is not in town to-day, but I have felt it due to him as a public man, and also to the bank over which he presides, to lose no time in contradicting so unwarrantable a statement.
*- I have the honour to be, Sir, your very obedient servasnt,
"JOHN GRIFFITH FRITH, Vice-Chairman."
The following is from the Port Philip and Colonial Gold Company:-
**he directors have received advicms from their resident director, dated Melbourne, 13th of February.

Barleyand oats arrived plentifully last weels, but ftour wheat, and other corn supplies were moderate. The exports ,ere only 1,430 qatrters of maize, and eight scks of flour. The home-grown wheat supply was 6,86 quarters, the foreig 5,671 quarters. The near counties sent but a moderato quantity for the morning, fine samples of which were more in request fat fully the prcvious rates, but inferior were sHll a dull sale. Fine foreign was also more in favour, but the lower kinds were very hard to sell
The receipts in flour were 16,683 sacks from the country, with 20 sacks and 1,250 barrels of foreign. No change took plac in prices of any description.
(1 English barley, there were .oniy 752 quarrr L t
foreign, mostly Danish and Mmburg, there were30,352 quarters. The malting season boing over, the bost qualities wore somowliat lower, but there was rather more demand for middling foreign.
Malt was a very dull sale, at about previous prices.
Of ctb there were in aU 36,186 quarters, consisting of 236 quarters English, 644 quarters Scotch, 3,740 quwrters Idsb, and 31,558 quarters foreign. The loss of a market-day last week added to the difliculty of selling, and prices were again 6d. to ls, lower.,
T he bean supplycoaistedof 69Squterahome-grown, and 685 quarters foreign.
The wbole quantity of peas was but 115 quarters, 60 quarters being foreign. Trade was steady, at unaltered quotations. The quantity of linseed was 1,154 quarters *gainst 560 quarters exportedL Crushing seed was is. per arter lower, but cakes contlnne to meet good inquiry, on previous terms.
Very little wa doing iu lovered Red ws little altered, but white seed and trefoil were quite neglected. Tares were unusually dull and depressed. Mustardseed supported its value, as well as canary. Hremoseed nan other descriptions of seed were unchanged.

Witneis had occasion to leave for a short time, when he heard a noie like the report of a cannon, accompenid with a

WAs employed by Mr. owres, a builder who acted under Mr. Pirker, the sutreyor to the Duke of Bedford. During the time hle was at wor. he believed the wall to have been a sonid one. On the other side of the wall there was a roof, some stabling, and buildings. After the wall fell he assisted in removint the deceased from the Tabbish.

THE SPEAKERSHIP.-What Baron Wood said of
Tup SPEAKERsHIP..-What Baron WVood said of wrines is certaLinly true of Speakers Of the House of Corn. Mons--namely, that some may be better than others, but that none are bad. In this faith we are quite easy about the choice of tho Speaker of tho new House. We cannot forget, indeed, what very inferior mnen have made good Speakers. A shallower man, for examplo, than Mr. Man. nfrs Sutiton conld hardly be named; but he acquitted himself suffioiently well irn the chair, and was renovsned for the tone of voice in which he callod ' Order." The Speaker is a sort of drum-major. Ho must b ortly and pompos. It should be his endeavour to imitato the look of tho mace as much as possible, the sight of which inspires beholders with so much indefinite awe, and all the more beause no one can imagine whit it Is good for, except sometimes to lie on and sometimes to lie under the table. If a bad Speaker conld be chosen, which we believe to be utterly impossible,whatwould hapen? Wouldthenew members tumu the House of wsindow? Would the event be like the disaster which followed Phaeton's tryinm his hand at driving the chariot of the sunm We believe not If the Speaker were remiss the House would take care of itself, and fkll the chair. There r&etalways in it old stgers
Ineogh to keep the new ones in check and in order. Bat I here is not the least chance of the choice of a had Speaker. The candidates *ro unobjectionable Mr. Fitzroy is an excellent man, who has done much good serrice in a quiet. unpretending way; Mr. Baines is thoroghglly sound and aLble - Mtr l Denison is not bad. The lat Is ereferred. He las n~ot'been too good a Reformer or riberal, zot too muchi in earnest about anything; and, above all, he is of the three the most of a druxn-ma lor Hao will be awful in a big wig, and wil fil youn snem^brs with a strange awe when he cries "1Order." ;at more is wanted in au incarna.- tion of rules I It was Partridge's not unna tnral maistake to Fuppose that the actor who plasyed the part of king must be the first of the comrpany, and in every respect very much like the king of a stage troop is the Speaker of the Commons. He must have a person, a presence, and a big voice for a very few words; a stocc of indifference to persons, and, perhaps, to things;- a good, cook, and cellar to match. With these qualifications his election mnust be c-onducted as if the working and charactr of the representative system all depended on it.-Rzamincr.

London, Tuesday, April 14, 1857.
LOZNDOZN. TUESDA. AYPrL 14, 1857.
England is a much less settled country than is commonly imagined. The proofs of thin might be multiplied almost indefinitely. It is computed that there are two hundred thousand people in England alone who are tramps, without any settled habitation ;-about the number of the aborigines of New Zealand. Should that island, therefore, ever bo colonized as thickly as England, without any decrease of its native tribes, they would make about as much figure among the newcomers as our Gipsies, travelling tinkers, hawkers, and other tramps. Our metropolis and grcat towns, strange to say, are the least settled portions of the empire. The Arabs of the street are a recognized class 'whom it is held scarcely possible to deal with, and it is said that few of them know where they will get their next meal or their next night's rest. For many years past our industrial customs have defied all order or method, aud tle very hands which contribute most to the not less solid than showy externals of our social system have the least share of it. The power that rears our mansions, our churches, our theatres, and our bridges, that makes and maintains our rail'ways and our streets, and does a hundred offices -without which London would be intolerable, is evolked, as it were, out of chaos. The contractor holds up his finger, and they appear, no one knows whence, no one lnows whither to return. They are so abstract from all the fixed relations of life that even the philantbropist heaitates or forgets to dive or burrow after them. Indeed, it would require the arts of a magician, clues, charms, and transformations, to do this successfully. All our social apparatus is Iccalized and divided to excess. Everything is fixed, every man is tethered; and so wedded are we to the system, so much do we fear having to swim for our lives in a general unsettlement, that we hold it treazon to take up a fixture, be it ever so useless, or to lengthen a tether even when it is srangling its victin. Such prejudices are an excellent stock in trade for the charlatan, who dearly loves a specious inutility. Only the other day it was proposed to send some oE the emapty city churches after their own congregv,tiong into tbe suburlbs, and some of the Mnost -disreputable members of the House
of Commons raised such a hubbub about
the hallowed sites, -the sacred stones, and the consecrated timber, that the House of Commons was frightened, and let the suburban souls go their own way. The City of London in this, as in almost every other respect, i. the most enormous, most costly, and most cumbrous fixture in the world. For what period of time it is intended we knov not, as our religion tells us it will not be for ever, and experience equaUly assures us it is not for present utility. Its institutions profess to be for the good of man, but they for whom the benefit is intended launch forth hke ducklings from the wing of the foster hen. It is a fleet of huge threedeckers, while the people it is meant to deal with are scattered in shallows atid aground up creeks.
Such is the fact-it affords an almost unanswerable apology for those who administer this huge finality and cannot follow its movement. What can be done with people who have no whereabouts i A new street is wanted, with handsome shops, roomy warehouses, and magnificent edifices for public institutions or mercantile companies. No doubt, it is a great benefit to the neighbourhood and to the metropolis, which wilingly submits to be taxed for the purpose. But it is necessary first to get rid of some hundred, or even some thousand, people, who for this purpose are pronounced thieves, tramps, costermongers-in a word, Irish. In many instances we 'believe them to be exceedingly useful and meritorious members of society, maintaining themselves and their famiies with hard and honourable labour, which is more than can be said of many who are their " betters." Bat they are turned out, commonly by the pick and crowbar, and no one asks where they go. No alderman, no clergyman, no relieving-officer, no functionary of any sort, not even the philanthropist, tracks the outcast crowd. No poet immortalizes the deserted alley and its touching traditions. The rubbish goes its way, dead or alive. Carts of refuse turn down one way, dirty families another,-the one to some chasm where rubbish may be shot, the other to some court, or very fallen street, where lodgings are to be let. Some locality, already rather uninviting to the taste of those who can, and perhaps ought, to do some good, becomes charged with an accession of misery and dirt. It is rather worse than it was before. Before very long relieving-officers and registrars discover that there is more fever and death there than there used to be, and the police possibly discover a new resort of crime. Such is the way in which " rookeries" are disseminated. For every clearance in the interior of the metropolis they are driven, by a sort of centrifugal force, outwards, to the outlying wards, the deserted mews, streets that rumour has blown upon, and the distant suburb. What is to be done with these people ? It is hardyes, "hard" is the word-that the authorities of each new locality squatted on by the dismal emigration should have to stand all the trouble 4nd cost ef looling after it,-all the blame of almost certain failure. Confessedly the people themselves are most difficult to deal with. In the case of the Irish, who constitute a large part of them, and who were the chief occupants of the filthy sties desribed by Dr. LTurnBY, their habits, their prejudices, their religion, their failings, and even their virtues,-that is, their strong social feelings,-offer great difficulties. They will be dirty, and nobody shall clean them. They will huddle together, and nobody shall separate them.
It is rather remarkable-and it is common justice to state the fact-that the same state of things is found at this moment in all the other great cities of Europe. Everywhere there has been a great congestion to the metropolis; everywhere there have been improvement and enterprise at the cost of those who are, and ever will be, the last in the rawe. What is to be done with the very sediment of society, that is always to happy to settle down to its lowest conditions, and that will always spend in some inflammrtory drink or noxious drug that which would procure wholesome lodging and clothing ? We do not for an instant question that the chief responsibility of this wrelchedness remains with the sufferers themselves, who are often even unaware of their degradation, and have to be driven out of it. Yet, the less conscious they are of it, and the more obstinately they cling to their rags and their lairs,-the more difficultit is to ferret them out of their burrows, the greater is the evil. These wounds and putrefying sores of society are more than skin deep. It is something that we have a machinery for their detection and exposure; and we do not at all undervalue the fact that, at all events, we have such a report as Dr. LETHxrn's, and shall probably hear more from him and from other medical officers. Only a few years ago people knew as little about these horrors as they did about the haunts of smugglers, or illicit distilleries, or still worse dens. The evil is now dragged into the intolerable light of day. So far so good. Nothing at present is to be done but to enforce the sai-. tary inspection and reglulation of the Lodginghouses to the utmost extent of the law, and to come to the Legislature for further powers and more stringent rules, if necessary. It is stated that it will not answer to build proper Lodging-houses for the poor so long as they are permitted to live in the places and in the manner they now do; that they could generally afford better lodging if they pleased; and that the closeness and dirt of the lodgings are the chief cause of that continual prostration of strength and spiit wbich compels the dram and the pipe. The first thing to be done is to go at once to the evil, and put all Lodging-houses into good order, reducing the inmates to the legal mcwxi mum. Nobody should be permitted to poison the common atmosphere, even if we cannot make him take care of himself; but we must say that if the Legislature, by the medium of commissions and other public bodies, may build good dwelling-houses and shops for tne higher and middle classes-if it may undertake these strictly private works, and if it also happens that by this very process it is robbing the accommodation of the poor for that of the better classes, then surely it may and ought to undertake Lodginghouses for the Poor. No reason of political economy can be suggested for the one which does not apply to the other; and humanity is in favour of those who are less able to help themselves. Various sites have been suggested, and certainly
many are available for the purpose. Experience shows that a weU-conduebed Lodging-house need be no more a nuisance to the neighbourhood than the cottages which house a gentleman's labourers. The best rule is that a labourer, whether in country or in town, should live near his work.
We published yesterday a roll of honours which
We published yesterday a roll of honours which must have carried pride and gratification to many a household among us, and which should havo been read vith admiration and pleasure by all clames in the kingdom. Fivo hundred of the French war medals were assigned by the EMi'EROR for distribution among the worthiest claimants-noncommissioned officera and soldiers-of the British Army after its service in the Crimea, and a corresponding number of men have accordingly been selected for the receipt of this enviable decoration. Four-fifths of -the medals were distributed before Sebastopol itself, on the very ground where they had been so gallantly won, the remainder being reserved for that portion of the force which had left he Cnmea ISefora -the distribution -was made.* :fany of these names have been aI@akedy-pub,.
was always a valuable man on pickets ;" while Private Jonw SAvaGE "distinguished hiraself on "outpost duty arnd by bis care and attention to "his horse duting- the svere winter, never miss"ing a turn of duty, from sickness or anv other "cause." Sickness, indeed, seems to have been absolutely. kept down and stifled by the will and ~devotion. of therc determined men. It was not that they escaped-its attacks-few did-but thit they held on to their duty in despite of it as long as .strengthwouldatand. SergeautJTrs NwruT,of the4th Foot, "duling the winter of 1854-1855,thouoh i"s uffering severely from sickness, continued cheer" fully to perform his duty." Colour-Sergea&t JAMES GA BurTr, of the 39th, !while under medical treatment, -joined his regiment ot the 18th of " June, kno .ing .hat in importaint.. attack waa "s aigned z tihe trigade to which he beloned,
lished, and we have now concluded the catalogue by the list to wbich we refer.
It must be understood that every name on this honourable roll represents distinguished personal merit-not, indeed, necessarily any particular or isolated act of daring, but always and in every case some positive desert or superior title to notice actually ascertained and verified. The peculiar character of the war, indeed, was especialy calculated to elicit all the varioux qualities which constitute the excellence of a soldier. There was the long and painful service before the beleaguered town, in which the besiegers suffered the straits of the besieged; there were the incessant night sorties, in which a few hundreds of half-famished men were brought into fierce colision with a desperate enemy; there were the successive assaults made upon works of enormous strength; there was the great pitched battle of Inkermann-one of the deadliest on record; aud, as if to complete the comprehensiveness of the campaigns, there was the unparalleled Cavalry Charge of Balaklava. The results of aU these tests we now discern in such a record of spirit, bravery, endurance, and general heroism as has rarely been set before the public. All arms of the service are represented in the list-Cavalry and Lnfantry, Artillery and Engineers; and the impressivenews of the picture ought to be enhanced in the eyes of Englishmen by the utter absence of colouring or varnish. Actions and efforts of the most extraordinary merit are chronicled in a few brief words, and the deserts of a service extending over two years of the severest trial are often compressed into a couple of unpretending lines.
In its list of heroes, where all are so heroic, the 63d Regiment appears nobly conspicuous. We seem, indeed, to be introduced again into the very thick of the fight at Inkermann by the returns from this valiant corps. On that memorable day, as our readers will remember, it was hotly engaged. The whole battalion was brought breast to breast with the Russian masses, and the officers carrying the colours were struck down. Under these circumstances COlOur-Sergeant JOHN BROPHY-now Lieutenant in the Lancashire Militia-took up the colours dropped by Ensign CLuTTERBucH, and, though seriously wounded, defended them and brought them safe from the mele. Sergeant ATHu ROBERTS, carrying one of the colours after the Ensign had been severely wounded, himself " received a wound "which caused him to fall. Hle got up quickly,. "took up the colours, and, refusing to leave the " field, continued to carry the colours until inca"pacitated by a second wound." Sergeant WIL. LIAM Auuxu, it being known that Ensign CLuTrrxBUCK was kiZled, and that his body was left on the field, " instantly volunteered to fetch it, and, being " accompanied by a private, he went far in ad"vance and brought in the body. On the same day, "the only officer in his company being wounded, "he took the command of the company, " and held it during the charge, main"taining discipline and conduct." Private JoN "'GoWAN "behaved in a particularly " gaUant and bold manner, charging, forwarding, " and being the first to clear a breastwork in pur" suit of the enemy." Private DANEL SULLIVAN,
" one of his comrades being made prisoner by five - " of the enemy, rushed at them, kiUed three, aud " rescued his comrade." Boththese soldiers, too, are especially described as evincing the utmost spirit and courage on all occasions; while ColourSergeant MoBBis, still of the same corps, finding himself in the battle far in advance with a number of men, " collected them, took the command, " and, though attacked by superior numbers, " maintained his post, repulsing the attacking " party.''
Nothing is more remarkable in these records than the promptitude shown, even under the most dangerous conditions, in volunteering to bring in the wounded. On the 18th of June, when a portion of Sebastopol had been taken by Sir W nLnu Evnx and his Brigade, groans were heard by the party in occupation of the trenches near the Cemetery, upon which Lieutenant SMrYT, the officer in command, asking for aid in the attempt, was immediately joined by LAWRENCE LED, MAIrTIN LYoNs, and M'CuLSmY, of the 39th, and the whole four then advanced close to the Russian sentries in the face of a storm of fire, and "brought in a "wounded sergeant of the 38th, who had been "lying for 15 hours" in his pain. Of the 17th Regiment seven men, one of whom, THomAz LAWLESS, is noW selected for the medal, " went " out on the glacis of the Great Redan, under " very heavy fire, and brought in the dead body " of their captain, JoHN CRorER ;" and Corporal PHILIP SaMITH distinguished himself on the same occasion 'by going out " several times " under very heavy fire, and bringing in several " wounded men on his back." In the 9th Regiment Sergeant Ezxrr Frams " exposed himself to "great personal risk on the 18th of June in order "to succour Lieutenant-Colonel LOWTH, 38th "Regiment, when wounded ;" and his bravery was emulated by Private D. A'LMAHow, who "exposed himself, and rescued a wounded com"rade in the trenches when the working party to "which he belonged was driven back by the de"structive fire of the enemy."
We observed, however, that it was not simply for individual acts of bravery or devotion that these decorations have been awarded, nor do we, indeed, consider that any particular feat of daring could surpass the merits disclcsed in some of the general testimonials to the character anid bearing of the soldier. What, for example, could possibly be more honourable thau the report made of Private RrcAnn HOGAN, of the 17th Regiment, who was " distinguished by his officers "and many of his comrades for superior in"telligence in the trenches ? Always ready and "forward for any duty there. Never missed a "duty. Present with his regiment during the "whole period of his service in the Crimea. "Always cheering and encouraging his comrades. "Wounded." Why, all that is excellent in soldiership seems told in these short, pithy notes. So, too, with Sergeart-Majors J. RussExL, S. GREIrTH, and WraIrTA STEWART, of the 5th Dragoon Guards, the latter of whom "had two horses
"killed under him at Balaklava, but still continued "to act, procuring a third horse, and remaining "in action with his regiment. Was present at "Inkerman, and never absent from his duty a
"single day throughout the war, during the whole
"of wbich trying time he never relaxed in his
"endeavours to benefit the men and horses of tho "regiment." In the 1st Dragoons Sergeant-Major MATTHEW BAuxn " never missed a days duty, and
and was obliged to go into hospital i-ediatelI
"on bis retum." 7Some of the testimonials given are wonderful in their point and brevity. Bombardier J. BowER, of the Royal Artillery, " always " behaved well under fire." Sergeant TEos
WAIsH, of the same corps, " displayed on " all occasions (he served in the trenches from "9 November, 1854, to the fall of Sebastopol) great " bravery and coolnens under fire, setting a good " example to young soldiers." Of Corporal
ICHZL MoXONAHA-, of the 9th, it is said, " This " man's gallantrphas been always conspicuous " and in two or three cases the title of the claimants to the medal is summed up in the sententious remark-" A good soldier."
Good, indeed, they all were; so good that it has been hard to choose for any special notice even such examples as those recorded above, and they must be received rather as specimens than zelections of the heroes of the Brtish army. The medal which is to be worn will honour at once the giver and receiver, and will be evidence not only of the bravery which deserved the decoration, but of the munificence and disceinment with which such deserts were recognized.
One of the last subjects occupying the attention
One of the last subjects occupying the attention of the Late House of Commons is likely enough to be among the first presented to the notice of the new one. It concerned a question of internal economy, appearing under the shape of Parliamentary Printing Accounts; and our readers may probably recollect some observations in which, on the 13th of last January, we introduced them to the various points of administration and thrift which the subject involved. We do not propose to repeat these details, but a few plain remarks will be serviceable in placing before the public a matter which deserves to be regarded under more aspects than one.
Separating Parliamentary printing, in the strict acceptation of the term, from other printing executed on behalf of the State, we may say that two principal branches of the account are distinguishable,-one created by the orders of the House upon the motions of Members for Returns, &c., or upon the Reports of Select Committees, an(d another arising out of papers " presented by " command," such as copies of Treaties er Correspondence, Reports of Commissions, and so forth. In both of these cases the documents produced faU under the general description of Parliamentary Papers, but the proportions assumed under each head are somewhat different. In the case of Returns the usual rule is to strike off 1,000 copies, but twice, or even five times this number, are occasionally printed in the case of Commission Reports. Another distinction, toe>, requires to be noticed. The Report of a Committee or Commission ordinarily comprises two separate portions; first, the Report itself, strictly so called, or, in other words, the conclusions to which the Committee or Commissioners have arrived, and next the evidence on which their opinions have been founded. Sometimes there is a third section of the document in the form of an appendix, containing long calculations, averages, or tabulated statistics of any sort which may have been coUlected during the progress of the inquiry. It will easily be understood that the second and third portions of the paper are generally far more voluminous than the first, and that they absorb, accordingly, a large share of the outlay incurred.
For the regulation and reform of them various proceedings Committees of the House of Commons have been appointed at intervals sinee 1830, their duties being to assist the SPEAKxv, upon whom the superintendence of the printing in the first intance devolves. The chief objects have- been to promote good management in the direct aetion of the House, and to bring, if possible, unitr more effective control -that large and heavy amount of work, in the shape of Commission Reports, &-c., which is not directly created by the House, but the results of which come before it in the foru of the charges incurred. In aid of the former purpose it has been suggested that before motions are made for Returns the Librarian of the House should be consulted as to the existence, or otherwise, of the information required in documents already printed, and as to the best shape to be given to Returns when ordered. In respect of Reports, it has been questioned whether the appendices, or even the evidence, should necessarily be printed with them, and whether a diminution in the large number of copies struck off might not be effected without prejudice to any of the objects desired.
As regards the general scope of these regulations and proposals, it is certainly impossible to withhold approval. Nothing can be more natural, or more easily comprehended than the manner- in. which printing of this kind, and especially the. printing of Commission Reports, might run to waste. When a Commission is appointed by the CaOowy ie receives a carte blanche to print at the expense of Government. The authorities of the Stationeryoffice keep a vigilant check upon the charges made by the printer, but over the orders of the Commission there is no control whatever. The Report, with its evidence and its appendix, as the case may be, is sent to press, and thousands of copies are ordered of a produiction which may command scarcely any sale at all, and the interest in which may be confined apparently to a very small number of persons. This, in fact, is ofiten the practical result. Volumes upon volumes, produced at a large expense to the country, become so much waste paper, and the trouble of the House and its officers is actually taxed to provide receptaces for the ponderous accumulations of unread and unsaleable documents. It is certainly no wonder that those most immediately conversant with such abuses should desire to see them reformed, or that officers whose duty it is to economize in their respective departments the resources of the State should deplore such an unproductive outlay of public money.
If we offer any observations implying doubts upon this subject, it is not in derogation of the efforts which have been so laudably made, but simply on behalf of certain distinct principles which are involved in the questions at issue. We have already said that the matter presents more than one aspect deserving of regard ;-that of economy has already been noticed, but that of general policy should not be forgotten. It should be remarked that the question, after all, is one of popular instruction. It may happen, and no doubt does so, that this intended instruction is occasionally so managed as to combine the maa-i,num of outlay with the minimum of result, even to the extent of printing sometimes huge volumes never likely to be read at all, and in so
far as this abuse can be remedied without injury to the principle itself the reform woildd be clearly advantageous and desirable. It appears to us, however, a very possible event that economy in this particular department of State expenditure may be exercised with greater general damage than speoial profit. We do not doubt the existence of waste, but the waste, be it remembered, occurs in a supply which can hardly -bo too liberal. The question on one sido is that of the saving, at most, of a few thousand pounds; on the other of stinting or expanding the information of the public on matters of the very highest concern. During the very last discussions upon our foreign poliey Lord Cm&i- Dox observed, that never had so many papers or such ecpious intelligence been laid before Parliament and the.nation Am in the last few yeara. Of this expansion nobody
iz likely to diapprove; but that it entailed a proportionate increasw, not only of outlay, but of waste too, we may be tolerably sure. Taldng even the case of Commision Reports, in which, perhaps, the greatest excess is committed, it is clear that the subject-matter must be of some public interest, or the inquiry need never have been undertaken, while it is by no means impossible that the evidence attached may not only be intrinsically valaable, but necessary to the proper estimation of the Report itself. We do not affect to question the evils complained of, but if the first object in such proceedings-as must surely be the case-is not to save money, but to diffuse knowledge, any curtailment of the supply should be very jealously regarded. What is the practice of societies formed for the dissemination of information, sacred or otherwise I They keep a sharp control over their accounts, but as regards the multiplication and distribution of their publications they apply very little check, being well aware that the seed must be sown broadcast if it is to come up at all, and quite prepared to mak-e many sacrifices for the salko of some returns. The diffioulty, of course, in the case before us is to effect retrencliments undoubtedly called for without injury to principles which are of even greater value than those of public economy. By aU means let us save 10,0001. a-year in printing, if we can safely do so, but to accomplish this amount of reduction in an expenditure of 60,000,0001. at any material cost to the information of the public could hardly be a policy befitting the country or the age.

Tbe return of Mr. W. H. Gregorr forthe county of Gal way has produced even a better moral effeat than *bo mere lowering of the influence hitherto exercised by Archbishop WHale In the province subject to his government. It has elicited the following manily and spirited zemarks, which coming from a Roman Catholic journal of undisputed orthodoxy, foreshadow the decEns and fall, at no distaxt day, of that system of spiritual terrorism which converted Irish freedom of election into a mockery ane clelusion. "If," says the Galway Vindmicator, "there be any credit due to the fieeholdar3 of this county ftr placing Mr. Gregory second on the poll, it lies in this-that they did so of their own mere motion, and in, opite of the highest influence that cou)d be brought to beau on their minds and bias their votes. Its a new thing in the hiistory of Irish elections that honest frieze coats for onoe depended on their own judgmcnt, amd refused to listen to the suggestive policy of bishop an& otergy. This is one replr to thoe assertion made every day, that the Irish are thle-most priestridden people on the face, ef the globe. We will go further than this. It is a matter of general belief' with respectable Catholics that it was the interference of the Archbishop of Taam and some of his clersgy, by their puklished resolutions, which mainly touded. to the unsenting of Captain Bellew. Any string of resolutions, however strong in his favour, we believe would notb have the effect of returnhghim for the county; but the lukewarm and negativesup. port offered by the unmeaning and'contradic%ory affirmations of those publisbed certainly damag him irretrievably, and set the seal of defeat upon him before he canvassed a singloe elector. We say any resolutions, however strong, 'wouldnot have made his cause better, bsesuse the electors believe they are now fully competent to judge for themselves, and to act as freemen in a-matter which sr vitally concerns their political rights. and, iaterests. This is-thoe feeling abroad, and it. would be silly affectation and mereparasitical fawning to attempt to disguise it. It will boalways advanitageous for a candidate to have the golden. opin3ons of all good men, lay or clerical, in his favour.
But hencefo"h, unless some newr and unexpected. ph:ae o>f tyranny shall manifest ibself, and perh spa not even thee, a written character from. Churchmuen, hov,ever pure, will not ct as the ' openes4ame,' or commaudthe keys of the county or the sweet voice' of the electors. Here is another fac for the Exeterhelites and British bigots of every hue,-the Catholic oconstituency of thiscounty have returmed a Protestant gentlbinan to Parliament in preference to a Catholic. Tbe downright Papists of Connaught, in the teeth of the expressed wishes of an inflnential portion of their clergy, and notwithsitanding their sauposed bigoted dhesion to Romis3h influences, have put their trust in Mr. Grrgory, and confided to his hands tbesr political interests. Wbnt will the polemicahi and fanaticasl addressers of consJtituencies about Protestant exaltation and Papistiesl eneerviency say to thEis fact ? Are the rinsh Catbelies the blind idolators of a. system, as thsey are painted by those lovers of truth andgo3pel.1ighti They had
it In their hands, we repeat, to return a Catholic memberI for their county, and they voluntarily choose a Protestant genteman in preference. A better state-af things is dawning upon us as. we become more independent. Freedom of action and honesty of purpose are the levers by which Ireland will be raisedLet us practse those national vtuer and the reslt as sr as it i every way desirable."
The ofcil deelaration of the pol for the Derry election was signali2ed by a disgraceful riot in,the town of Coleraine, the partieulars of which are thus given in a local paper "'At 4o'llock Mr. Greer addressed a large body of electors fzom the windows of his comnittee-room in Water-
side-street, audtthsnked them cordially for the proud position. in which they had placed him. In the evening largo numbers, particularly of tho lowest classes, began to assemble in several of the streets, and, as therowas a rumour that a person who rendered himself very aotive in behalf of Mr. Greer, and au Orangeman to boot,, was to be burnt in effigy, Captain Consedine, tho- stipendiary mnagistrate who had charge here during the two days of the poMingc deemed it prudent to give instructions to the rilitary and cavalry to be ready. totumr out in caso of a disturbance. About 7 o'clock the streets were in a very ex, cited state, when the attempt st an of egy made its appear. ance from Bellhouse-lane, carried shou3der high by Archur Mooney, a drunken painter, and followed by a crowd of the rag, tag, and bobtail of the town. Captain Cousedino, with a few horsemen, howeve,j soon relieved Arthur of his burden, and made him. and his followers take leg-baiL The rabble then passed up Now-roai, breaking several windows on. their way, and os, coming to the house of Mr. S, White, who wae very active for Mr. Greer, they broke every pane in every wnndow in his house. They thon wended their way toNoew Narket-streetk shouting ' Bruce fur ever,' and, comLing to the house occupied by Mr. Neal D3rragh, grocer, began to ssnash his windows also. They were remonstrated with, but it only made them worse. A shot was then fred on the mob from the interior of the house, and the lead took effect on twoof the rioters, Arthur Mooney, anda ma.'anamed M'Laughlin. The excitement then became tremiiendous, and Captain Consedine at once rode at the head of the body of horsemen-.a troop of the 17th Lancers, so nobly distinguisbed for their e,ier-momorable gallantry at Balaklavato tx e scene of action. Seeing the excited state of matters, he read the Riot Act, and counselled all to bet:ake themselves to their homes, as he must clear the streets, which he vesy soon proceeded to do, and in a short time Done of the ' braves' were to be seen, and they who wrer so valiant a few minutes before were now-nowhere. A recurrence of the sanre disgraceful scenes was feared on the following night, but notbing took place to disturb th peace of the town, though a lot of low-looking runfians were waiting in the streets to join in any mW1. Their names were taken down by the police, and they wero never before so well watched as they are now."
The result of the contest for Kilkenny county is another instance of the chango of public opinion since the general election of 1852. At the latter penrd the Hon. Wr. Ellis, the nephew of Lord Carlisle, was, in sporting phrase, nowhere, while upon the present occasion he heads the poll over the two late members by an overwhelming majority. This is the more remarkable as the Lon. gentleman enters Parliament as an avowed Ministerialist and supporter of Lord Palmorston.

INDIA.
On Satuavy last we published a telegraphic tnessaae from Trieste, in anticipation of the Overantd Mail. We have now received our Indian letters and papers bythe Marseilles route. There Seem to be no advices from China by this arrival.
The following are our correspondents' letters *_
" BOMBAY, M&Rcn 10.
"The latest news that we have received from the 'Persian Gulf bears date the 25th of February. Vhen the steamer which brought it left Bushire 1?reparations were making quietly but rapidly for the despatch of a large portion of the force to attack the] Persian fortress of Mohammerah. This place is 'situated on the right or northern bank of the river Karoon, at the point where its waters join those of -the already united Euphrates and Tigris. Some 70 miles below, and by narrow and difficult channels, which however have been of late well surveyed, the open sea of the Gulf is reached. Above Mohammerah -some 30 miles, and on the Euphrates, is the Turkish town of Bussorah. Mohammeral, indeed, is a frontier -post of Persia, close upon the boundary line be'tween the territories of the Shah and the Turkish .provinces of Arabia. Comnmanding, as it does, the -current of the Euphrates, the Persian force sta. -tioned there have been able to do us not little -damage by intercepting the supplie3 which our commisariat officers at work among the Arab tribes despatch down the river for conveyance to the ,camp at Bushire. Hence the resolution of General Outram to attack and capture it while yet the remembrance of the rout at Khooshab is too
fresh in the minds of the Persian authorities to: render an attack on Bushire probable. It is, more-
over, suggested as a motive for occupying Moham- I merah that, with the mouth of the Karoon thus opened, an advance to Shuster and thence into the interior of the country will be comparatively easy. It is quite possible that this latter consideration has had weight with the General, and that such an advance may be contemplated as au ulterior operation. But at present the question of supplies is the more pressing one to an army encamped in a desert -country, with apowerful enemy in its front; and the great Mesopotamian highway as the principal, almost -the only, channel of such supplies, must be cleared and kept clear. For this purpose Mohamaimerah must be taken, and a sufficient force left in the place to prevent recapture. That done, the remainder of the force must hurry back to its camp at Bushire, to act on the offensive or the defensive as circumstances may require against the mass of the Persian army that will have been by that time got together to meet them.
"The defences of Mohammeralh arereportedas formnidable, and it is thought possible here that a heavy lORs on the side of the assailants will be attendant upon their capture. By the latest accounts they were manned by 14,000 Persian troops, with 14 guns, some of whom were stationed in the fortified town itself, the rest strongly intrenched in a date grove outside. The town will be assailed from the river by the steamers, the Semiramis leading. But the intrenchments in the date grove are not, I believe, accessible by the gins of the fleet, and must bo assaulted by the troops on shore. The portion of the force destined for this service, and of which the embarcation at Bushire had commenced at the date of the latest letters, consists of the 3d troop of Horse Artilery, Captain Aitken's field-battery (sent straight up to the river's mouth without being landed at Bushire), and, I believe, the whole or the greater part of the following corps :-the 64th, '78th Highlanders, 2d Europeans, 4th Rifles, 20th and 26th Native Infantry, and the Light Battalion, -with some Sappers and Miners. Several regiments wil leave a company or companies in the camp, and there also remain behind the 2d Beloochees, the 23d Native Infantry, and the whole of the cavalry. Wlhen Mohammerah shall have fallen Brigadier Hall will, I believe, be placed in command of the fortress withthe two nativeregimentsforminghis brigade,and the rest of the troops will, as I have intimated above, be reconveyead to Busbire with all speed. At Burazjoon, the site of the old camp, from which they were frightened away at the sudden approach of the English the day before the battle of Khooshab, the Persians are again collecting in force. Probably the General will not be able to repeat the blow that he so successfully dealt on the previous occasion without a large accession of strength, which he may await within his intrenehments undisquieted while his communications by sea and river with Turkish Arabia are secure.
" But where at the present moment we are to look for reinforcements on any large scale it is by no means easy to say. The army of the Western Presidency has done much, but it was thought that if aided in some of its stations by troops from Bengal or Madras it niight do a little more yet. The 3d Europeans, a lately raised reginent which has never yet seen service, is lying at Poonah. It lately received orders to march to Bombay, for embarcation, and was already on the way when an officer of the Quartermaster-General's Department was sent up in hot haste with counter orders, and the corps returned to its cantoninents. It ap. pears that the 1stMadras Funileers, who were tohave replaced their Bo-ubaybrethren at Poonah, could not, it was thought by the Madras authorities, be spared from their own Presidency. And without being replaced the Bombay regiment could not well be removed, fo,r its withdrawal would leave not a single European infantry corps in the Presidency lower than Deesa in the north, with the exception of the wing of the 86th stationed in Bombay. I touch here upon a question neither uninteresting nor ur.
important, the present feeling entertained towards our Government by the people of India and the native soldiery. In the ranks of thelatter two or three events have lately occurred to demand attention, and doubtless to be reported to exaggeration. Your Calcutta correspondent may have mentioned the stir among the high- caste Sepoys atBarrackpore upon learning or fancyjng that animal fat wyas used in the manufacture of some new cartridges, and thus, upon their biting off the end, brouight into contact with their lips. Another regiment in Bengal and one in Madras have also figured in the papers of late as being in a state of something like mutiny; but in -each case the exhibition of an insubordinate spi'-.
appears to have been due to injudicious orders, and ita extent has been, I imagine, considerablymagnified. Nor do I feel disposed to attach any political significance to an occurrence which is nevertheless Of a singular ancd somewhat perplexing character. From Cawnpore to Allahabad aud onwards towards the great cities of the north-west, the chokedars,
or policemen, have been of late speeding from village to village-at whose command, or for what
-object, they themselves, it i said, aTeignorant-little plaincakes of wheaten flour. The numberof thecakes and the mode of their transmission is uniform. Choiredar, of sillage A, enters village B, and, addresw ing its chokedar, commits to his charge two cakes, with directions to have other two similar to them prepared, and, leaving the old in his own village, to lie with the -new to village C, and so on. The English authorities of the districts through which these edibles passed looked at, handled, and probably tasted them, and, fnding them upon the evidence of Ull their senses harmless, reported accordingly to Government. And it appears, I think, with tolerable clearness, that the mysterious mission is not 'of political, but of sigperstitiots origin, and is
directed simply to theowarding off of diseases such as the choleraic visitation of 12 months ago, in which point of view it is noteworthy and characteria-
tic, not unworthy to be remembered together with lat
year's griw i4lni picturesque legend of the horseman vho rode i'wn to the river at dead of night, and was ferrie ektoss, announcing that the pestilence was in bhi. t. ii.
"Nevert i v 1eless, and attachingno moreth an their due imporran,.e to these things, I cannot doubt that the Goveri.nt jit do weeU to hesitate before withdrawng entirely `nglish bayonets from the Deccan. It is not so lion since the downfallof the Peishwah, but that tradji :in4 of the power of his family are rife amaong tht I;. ahmins in the bazaars of Poonah, and that craftry class have more influence over the Mahratta y -uth than is credited by those who are acquainted outlv with the 'Young Bombay' of the PresideutcN. There is, in fine, reason to feel assured that (evil bla-its are abroad. Not that there is the slightest cause for alarm. We arejust reminded that India .tE n uot yet be governed by the pen alone. We are sei-ding, then, no more European Infantry from Bontlay, though the 14th Light Dragoons are gone, or going, the last squadron leaving the harbour to-morrow. Their place is partly supplied by a wing of the 12th Lancers, of whom part have arrived from Madras, and others are daily expected. I n ouch another affair as that at Khooshab the 14th will have ample field to add another to their many laurels. The charge of the 3d Cavalry on that occasion, of which I wrote in my last, has caUed forth the admiration of a Bengal officer, who cites it in proof of what horsemen, well led, can do against infantry. After describing the formation of the Persian square as excellent, steady, and untouched by artillery, he proceeds (in a letter to a Calcutta paper) with so vivid a description of the charge-of which he had merely heard from eyewitnesses, not seen himself-that I am tempted to extract it:-
" ' When Forbes, who commanded this regiment, gave the order to charge, he and his adjutant, young Moore, placed themselves in front of the 6th troop, which was the one directly opposite the nearest face of the square. The other Moore, Malcoltnson, and Spens came the least thing behind, riding knee to knee, with spurs in their horses' flanks, as if racing after a hog. In rear of them rushed the dark troopers of the 3d, mad to avenge the death of poor Malet at Bushire. In spite of steel, fire, and bullets they tore down upon the nearest face of the devoted square. As they approached Forbes was shot through the thigh and Spen's horse was wounded, but unheeding they swept onward. Daunted by the flashes and the fire and the noise and crackle of the musketry, the younger Moore's horse swerved as they came np. Dropping his sword from his hand and letting it hang by the knot at his wrist, he caught up the reins iu both handz, screwed his head straight, and then coolly, as if riding at a fence, leapt him at the square. If, therefore, any man can be said to have been first, the younger Moore is that man. Of course the horse fell stone dead upon the bayonets; so did his brother's, ridden with equal courage and determinalion. The elder Moore-18 stone in weight, and 6 ft. 7, or thereabouts, in height-cut his way out on foot. Malcolmson took one foot out of his stirrup when he saw his brother officer down and unarmed (for his swordhad been broken to pieces by the fall), and, holding on to that, the younger Moore escaped. The barrier once broken, and the entrance once made, in and through it poured the avenging troopers. On and over everything they rode, til
getting clear out, they reformed on the other aide, wheeled and swept back-a second wave of ruin. Out of 500 Per. sian soldiers of the lst Regular Regiment of Fars, who com. posed that fated square, only 20 esoaped to tell the tale of its destruction. Thus the 3d Light Cavalry, to use their own phrase, gave our enemies ' a jeoab (answer) for the death of Malet Sakib Bahadur.'
"UAtthe date of the latest accountsfrom CabulDost Mahomed had not yet arrived at the capital. Inathe Punjab a large force is assembling at Debra Gbazee Khan-artillery, cavalry, and infantry-for service against a tribe cal'ed the Bozdars across the mountains. Brigadier Chamberlain commands in person, and some smart fighting is lo oked for. In Oude an affray has occurred, ending in loss of life to a member of the Bengal Civil Service. It appears that one Fuzl Ali, who had been long imprisoned for a murderous assault upon a IRoyal Minister some years back, escaped lately from custody and became the leader of a band of robbers. He had already wounded and eluded an English officer sent against him with a party of sepoys, when, as we learn to-day from the north-west, Mr. Charles Elliot Boileau, Deputy-Commisioner of Gonda, in Oude, 20 miles from Lucknow, heard of his proximity, and endeavoured to seize him. But Mr. Boileau, with the six troopers who accompanied him, fell into an ambush planted by the robber, and was killed himself, together with four of his men, the two others escaping grievously wounded.
"We have no local news of importance. The head-quarters of the army are still here, but probably will be moved to Mahabuleshwar shortly. The arrival of the next mail is anxiously looked for as expected to convey the result of the negotiations between Feruk Khan and Lord Cowley. I have omitted to mention, by the way, that the attack on Mohammerah would probably take place this week, somewhere between the 15th and the 20th, it is thought. In my next, therefore, I hope to be able to tell you of the result.
"A native holyday of several days in duration has rendered trade less stirring than of late. Money is plentiful, and the banks have reduced their rates of discount a further one per cent.
"Exchange on England, 2s. 32d."
" CALCUTTA, MARci 8.
"I have little to tell you of the war beyond this:The Scindian recently stated that a force had been ordered to rendezvous at Shikarpore, on its way to Quetta. The names of the regiments were given with a most circumstantial minuteness, and for a m oment the statement was believed. The Scindian, for reasons well understood on the spot, has excellent information, and rarely publishes an erroneous report. In this case, however, he has been misinformed. 1 am positively assured that no such orders have been issued. The Government of India maintains a rigid and most injurious srecy in regard to all the operations of the war. The frank policy of Lord Dalhousie has been abandoned, and the smallest facts are concealed as carefully as if the Persian Court were in communication with the Indian press. This mystification is a symptom of the weakness beginning to be felt in every department of Government. There is a want of courage, or, if you will, of audacity, in every resolution of the supreme authority. Troops, for instance, could have been sent to China from Madras with the greatest ease. The safety of Hongkong was endangered in order to avoid cesponsibility. Lord Dalhousie would have had 10,000 men afloat within a month after the requisition reached Calcutta. One regiment, the telegraph informs us, has at last been sent, but a regiment can do little more than garrison Hongkong.
"We have had another mutiny more serious than the last. The men of the 19th Native Infantry, at Moorshedabad heard of the dispute about the
cartridge paper. By way of expressing their feelilgs they held a parade on their own account with their arms. The Colonel commanding remonstrated with the native officers, who, as usual, adhered after a passive fashion to their superiora. The men,
however, were still refractory, and he called out a regiment of cavalry and two guns. The two arms inIndia seldom coalesce, and the cavalry are usually as trustworthy as marines on board ship. The men were then ordered to ground their arms and return to their baracks. They agreed if the Colonel wouldsend away his cavalry. The Colonel appears to have dreaded the responsibility of an armed conflict, and acceded to the conditions, for which he bas been
rebuked. It was undoubtedly a serious error of judgment, as it was almost impossble that !the infantry should 'have ventured to at. tack the guns, and there were 2,000 Sikh Ir-
regulars within 40 miles. I can readily imagine, however, that an old officer would from humanity alone be unwilling to see his own regiment cUt to '*es. Terrible as the necesity mRay be, however,
T ipsstion if thb &%calty will be overome w,t3osot
one severe example. This cartridge quetion is travelling northward, and will excite every Sepoy regiment in lndia, until in some station a determined Brigadier gives the men the option of obedience or death. There is on this subject no weakness either with Government or among the public. Every man feels to the bottom of his heart that the safety of the empire hinges on the instant suppression of mutiny in whatever shape it may appear. Some punishment will, I doubt not, be meted out to this regiment. The papers have a story that the King of Oude is at the bottom of it alL I need not say this is absurd.
" A strange and to some observers a very disagreeable incident has occurred in the North-west. A few days since a chowkeydar, or village policeman, of Cawnpore ran up to another in Futteghur and gave him two chupatties. These are indigestible little unleavened cakes, the common food of the poorer clases. He ordered him to make ten more, and give two to each of the five nearest chowkeydars with the same order. He was obeyed, and in a few hours the whole coantry was in commotion with chowkeydars running about with these cakes. The wave swept province after province with a speed at which official orders never fly. The magistrates were powerless, and the chupatties at this moment are flyingwestward. Nobody has the least idea what it all means. Some officers fancy it iB a ceremony intended to avert the cholera; others hint at treason-a view encouraged by the native officials; others talk of it as a triflea joke. For myself, I believe it to be the act of some wealthy fool in pursuance of a vow; but its d1gnificance is this *-There are some 90,000 policemen in these provinces. If they should perchance imbibe dangerous ideas, how perfect is their organization. I enclose evidence of this strange affair.
"There has been a trumpery disturbancein Oude, but it has no political significance. A well-known dacoit, named Fuezl Alee, -who has been proscribed for the last three reigns, took it into his head to cut up two police stations; so far as is apparent the outrage was a mere caprice. Of course, he fled, with the cavalry hard on his heels. He reached the lNepaulese frontier, however, and the frontier officers deny all knowledge of his existence. Jung Bahadoor will probably brng him to justice, as he has no interest in turnig his territories into a refuge for every scoundrdl who chooses to render Oude too hot to hold him. The new Oude Irregulars behaved very well, accomplishing a march of 60 miles in 30 hours. The indigo cultivation of Oude is said to be reviving. The province once produced fine indigo, but the revenue officers could not endure the presence of Europeans, and persuaded the King that the cultivation increased the price of grain. A native can never rid himself of the idea that cheap grain is a blessing even to the cultivator; and the King prohibited the growth of indigo.
"The annual reports contain, among other information, an account of the progress of Pegu. The province is becoming prosperous. The people have got rid of their notion that we were about to abandon the country, and are settling steadily to cultivation. The Burmese, Karens, and Shalm are thronging into the northern dis. tricts, and the area of cultivation has increased by 135,000 acres in one year. The export of rice has risen to 126,000 tons more than the usual export of Calcutta. The trade, which has sprung from nothing, has reached two millions sterling. The revenue is 30 lakhs of rupees (300,0001.), and the expenditure not 20. There is now no doubt, even among the opponents of annexation, that Pega in 20 years will pay a revenue such as in Asia is obtainable only from these rich deltas. Great efforts are being made to introduce superior cotton, but I have no confidence in them. A native does not want to be told to grow cotton. He will grow anything that will pay, and increase cultivation to any extent the moment the price rises. The demand for jute doubled last year, and was provided by the cultivators at once. It paid, and the "native prejudices" we are so fond of talking about never stand in the way of their interest. I saw a Parsee, a Brabmin, a Mebter (scavenger), and an Englishman all sitting on the same seat in the railway the other day, and all profoundly indifferent to the outrage on their respective superstitions.
" The Government ha's published a report on the working of the Post-office. The uniform threefarthing rate has now been in operation for two years. In that time the number of letters and newspapers carried by the post has exactly doubled, and the increase is progressive. The losa of revenue by the alteration is about 30,0001. a-year, but the deficit will be expunged in a twelvemonth. The natives, however, persist in sending unpaid letters, under the idea that they are more secure, and there is a lingering distrust of Post-office honesty. The benefits accrning from the reform are, however, eagerly acknowledged by the natives, who regard it as a direct redaction of taxation.
"The Maharajah of Gwalior, the chief of the MIahrafts princes, is on a visit to Calcutta. Re is an irascible, self-willed lad, very difficult to manage. He went the other day down the river to visit the Fort Glocester mills. On his way he was particularly boastful until he passed the house occupied by the n of Oude. The sig,ht sobered him in an instant, and his zeal for civilization instantly increased. He has been well educated, but seems falling back to the true native style of life and thought. In England there is great sympathy for these men. In India it seems horrible that a boy of this description, without principle or restraint, should exercise by our favour power of life and death over Fome millions of people."

The overland mail from London of the 10th of February, par Peninsular and Oriental ComPany's steamship Ganges, reached Bombay on the morning of the 9th inst.
Our money-market during the past fortnight has become very much easer, and the banks in consequence have reduced their rates of interest 1 per cent. aln round, and the rates now rule from 7 to 9 per cent., but money is obtainabla under the'a rates in the bazaar.
We have to report a further rise in Four per Cent. paper which we now quote 84, aud Fives par. Oar local stocks to some extent have also improved in value.
IMPORTS.
Cotton Piece Goods.-Since the despatch of last mail, very little basiness has been transacted in our market, owing to the intervention of the Holee holydays, which caused all doing to be suspended for a week. The market remains firm at last quotations.
Fancy Goods.-The market has been dull, except for articles of low qualities.
Cotton Yarns.-This article is dul, and no sales have been effected, with the exception of 100 bales. The market, however, is soon expected to resume an active appearance.
Metals.-An improvement has taken place in all descrip. tions except Swedish bar iron. We quote British bar at 35.r. to S6r, and Swedish bar at 60r. to 65r.per csndy. Spelter is in good demand, as also pig lead, of wvhich latter the stoc is very light.

The advices from the IUpperrerovince as remgards British cotton piece goods proving favourable, the sales during the fortnight have been to a satisfactory extent especially of gray goods, at the advance in prices noticed in our last, and but for the dearness of money, and the consequent want of facilities, we should have had to report alargo amount of transctions. Gray shirtings, jaconots, and madapollams have continued to sell freely. For mule twist, however, the demand hag been les active. In metals a fair businmess has been done.
Money-market.-A gradual improvement has been visible since our last. A better feeling among capitalists seems gaining ground, and there is every probability of the pressure soon disappearing from our market. The state of the Bank of Bengal having likewise improved, as we had auticipated, its rates of interest and discount have been reduced 2 per cent. all round in the interval, the margin of loans on deposit of Government secUrities remaining, however, untouched.

Bengal Coal shares have further declined, the last sale having been effected at 1,100r. each. In others we have not had much doing.

The rereipt, however, of orders from China by the Fiery Cross and Lightning on the 2d inst. for large shipments of rice caused much excitement, and tonnage to the extent of 13,000 tons was taken up at once for that country at S1 a bag, a smal uantity only having been engaged at a sligltly lower rate.
e ships taken up to loa with rice, we understand, are the Acastus, the Good Hope, the AIbion, the Bengal, 4e Coringa. the Crescent, the City, the Bushire Merchant, the Hanover, the Ariadne, the Rienzi, the Clasmerdon, and the Swartimore, to convey in all about 170,000 bags. One or two vessels ace loading for Australia, having come under chatter from that country. For Arnericathe rate continues at $10 a-ton, although many of the ships now in our harbour have been chartered there and sent out at 141. to 151. a-ton. The Conrad, now under repai, is engaged to load wlth a cargo of timber for Great

(FROM OUR OWN ODR.ESPOWDLNT.)
NEW YORK, ART7LL
The President has, by final decisi)n, obtained relesse from a large section of his persecutors. The Federal oftfces for the State of New York are at last bestowed, a fact that was announced hera late at night by a salute of 100 guns, or of one gun fred 100 times. The gun, an important instrument of city politics, belongs to the Empire Club, andon any occasion of democratic rejoicing is brought into. the park and fired, without remorse or regard for the nerves and wndovw of the neighbourbood. On ibis occasion it notified a special as vrell as general triumph, the President of the club, Captain Ryndera, an influential poitician of the "rowdy" class, but a little softened of late by place and salary, having been appointed United States' Marshal, "rotating" into that office from a deputy sturveyorrhip in the Custom-house, his former post. " The gun" of course did its loudest for such an event, as the Captain intends to turn out all the under officials of the department-Democrats though they be-and put in his immediate friends. The rernlt of the conflict at Washington between the two sections of the party is in favour of the "Hards," and the " Softs" are discomfited; deeper into the intricacies of the dispute, personal and political, no one can attempt to go. The most important office, that of Collector of the Customs, has fallen to a gentleman, Mr. Schell, vwho is generally approved, and the appointment is considered good in every respect; the former Postmaster is retained by a compromise between the sections; as to the other appointments, the passive public draxvs its breath and says " they might have been worse," with a quiet resignation to the inevitable. The offices of other States are still under discussion.
The late decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Dred Scott is provoling demonstrations in some of the State Legislatures against the principle involved in it. The Massachusets and New York amendments to the State constitutions have teen proposed, more favourable to the free men of the coloured race than the clauses at present in operation. The Supreme Court declares that no man of negro descent is or can be a citizen of the United States. The Free States, which have already admitted them as citizens (local citizens, if the term is allowable) by giving them the right of voting. and the privilege of paying taxes, immediately, by way of protest, proceed to 2 e-affirm annd extend the rights of the proscribed race. This is called, in some quaxs ers, a mere empty demonstration; practically it may be so, for the more or less of rights and facility of exercising tbem conceded within each State will change nothing in the s5tatts of the' free negro. The trial Will be whenever any of these state constitutions are brought into actual collision with theFederal Power upon the interpretation of the Federal Constitution now given. Then the point will arise, how can that interpretation be enforced on States that thus set it at defiance ? It may be long ere such a question arises, but the protest now being made against the decision of the highest legal and constitutional authority of the Federation is a sign of the times, and a very significant one.
There is another movement going on, which, though not ostensibly directed against slavery as a system, must have an important effect upon it wherever it extends. It is weU known that the tendency of the population of the oldest States has been for many years to migrate to the unoccupied soil of the Wesl. The process has gone on till there are in the earliest settled Stateslands which, once cultivated, have reverted again to their first condition of wilderness. This is especiaUy the case with the State of Virginia, emphatically the "Old Dominion." It has gone back in relative if not actual importance and wealth from the era of the Revolution. The tobacco plantations were gradualy exhausted, and the increase of cotton culture further to the South drew away its people, black as well as white. At the present time many of what were once its finest estates are again covered with a second grovrth of the forest, and lie totally unproductive. Vhite labour shuns instinctively any contact with slavery, which degrades all industry that takes the same channel as the compelled toil of the negro. Hitherto the stream of free labour has flown westward, and speculation and competition have driven up the price of land in regions many hundred miles from the Atlantic to a rate far above that at which estates can be bought within reach of the coast, and near the largest markets of the East. Slavery turned the current of free enterprise away from the vicinity of the densest population to the unpeopled praries. A change is coming over this condition of things, and it is probable the current will take a new direction-which is really the old one. The abandoned tobacco plantations of Virginia are to be reconquered and turned into farms, cultivated by free labour with corn and grain. There are large tracts of land for sale in many of the slave States, under conditions of climate which permit the white man to work; there is a natural limit to the possibility, but within that linit the field is a very wide one. In the exhausted eastern counties of Virginia land may be bought for three and five dollars an acre, less than must now be given in TMausas and Miinnesota. There are tbousands upon thousands of acres of land in Virginia held upon hopeless mortgages by merchants and brokers in New York and Philadelphia, who have not been able to sell it at any price. It is proposed to deal with it as if the " Old Dominion" were new territory,-in fact, to resettle it under new conditions. The process has been actually commenced in Virginia without any organization for the purpowe, and the plough is passing over many of the "Plantations" that figured so prominently in the history of the 1lth and first half of the last century, which had been abandoned and are now reclaimed with good results. The present plan is to carry on that process more systematically and on a more extended scale. Black and white labour vill not mix together, but it has been shown that they may exist side by side. There are large settlements of Germans in the slave State of Texas who reject slavery altogether, and their farms are the best cultivated in that immense and fertile region. If the movement were exclusiiely northern it might fail; the South generally would regard it in the light of an invasion-ns the extreme partisans of slavery do. But there is a large mass of opinion in the South favourable to the change ; the contrast between the busy prosperity of the North with the decay and stagnation of the South is too great to exist for ever, at least so near the border as Virginia. There are many of the proprietors friendly to the change, and will support it. Similar influences are at work in Maryland, Kentucky, and AMissouri. Thus, while the South is all but supreme in political power, and is even extending its claims so as to provoke the North to resistance, sociallv or matoriaUy it is not increasing, but rather the reverse; its grasp on new northern territory will ultimately be shaken off, as in Kansas, and it is threatened within its own borders. The higher civilization of the North is gradually bearing down upon it, and will slowly occupy the soil slavery has abandoned. PoliticaUy, slavery, or the power based on it, is supreme; materially, its northern borders are being eaten into by the advancing wave of free white immigration. The spectacle of the resettlement of old States and the reclaiming soil once cultivated and forsaken will be a new one, even on this continent of novelties.
The Illinois arrived on the 2Bth with intell;gence from Nicaragua, which indicates that the total ruin of Walker is rapidly approaching. A fate worse
than defeat has overtaken him; he is belng aban- |
doned by his men in bodiestolrge forhimto a
tempt to check their desertion by the unspaing severity of his military executions of those who were takel in the attempt before the disaffection became generaL By the last accounts received it was stated the mnen had become so disgusted with the brutality drunkenness, and incapacity of the officers, and Walker's cold and cruel neglect of the sick and wounded, that in an attack on San Jorge they refuEed to advance. After this incident they began to leave the encampment at Rivas with their arms in bands too numerous for the patrols to stop, and ready to fire on them if they interfered. Of his 500 men, a body of 126 went 'over to the Costa Rican lines and surrendered. They were treated well by the allies, clothed and fed, ind received a free panage to-the United States. They had arrived by a steamer at Panama ; some of them came on to New York by -he Illinois; others rould leave foi New Orleans. Befo thoir departture above 70 of them signed an addresa- to their fellow-oldler; still reaining 'wi h Walker' describing the,. tretment -they hiiI met andc the fair tes kept'with tltma arid the,y urged theic comrades
to abandon the adventurer as soon as possible, "as he had deceived them from the first mnon2ent of entering his service." A large number of the recruits from New York were utterly ignorant of the country and its condition, and actuaUy thought they were g, 0oing as settlers i all the warnings of the press were n£sJeSs (nothing mn a paper opposed to a party ja ever believed); a8 soon as they arrived they were pushea' against the enemy, as Walker had found a fear days suffldent to open their eyes and cool their enthusiasnta for him. The Tenee was telegraphed from New Orleans yesterday, with a body of 90 of the deserters on board. Walker has probably lost, within a few days, nearly one-half of the remnant of his army; and those who return to the cities vill, to judge by the acaunts they have published, be missionaries of the msost effective kind against~ him. In the meantime the native allies were closing him in at Rivas. It was supposed they would not; make an attack on the place but starve it out, as his comunications with the lake, the river, and the, Atlantic were quite cut ofif aud all his vessels andl boats seized.
The Governments of the Central Americaa Republics have prepared to enter into an arrangement with respect to Nicaragua that wil have the effect of expunging that State from the map; in fact, a partition of Nicaragua is resolved on, that State itself being an. assenting party. Commissioners representing Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatepiala, Honduras, and San Salvador are to meet at San: Mguel (in Salvador) to draw up the terms of a. settlement of the country, by which Nicaragua is to be divided among and annexed to the other States. Costa Rica will take tbe territory on both sides the San Jnan river and that between the lake and the Pacit2c, as far north as Masaya, the scene of the first of Walker's recent series. of disasters. Chontales wiU be giver. to Honduras. The remaLinder falls to the share of San Salvador. This aettlenauit, it is stated, is proposed by Nicaragua itself, -which despaira of maintainincr peace in the country by any other means. ft is to continue for a certain number of years, not yet fixed, at least not specified, after which the people may resume their independence if they choose. This arrangement throws the transit route, for which the war was fed by rival steamboat companies, into the hands of the rulers of Costa. Rica,'who alko hold the captured steamers, and have altogether a very good 'vantage ground for "negotiation" with the new parties, who, it is understood, wish to re-establish the traffic.
By the Illinois we also received news from California, the tendency of which will not be to raise the quotations of the State bonds. California, it has been announced, is on the verge of repudiation; it may if it will, as nearly the whole of its debt has been illegally or unconstitutionally contracted. The State is strongly tempted, and there are misgivingg that, having to decide between payment and ponpayment, it will decide in the negative. The point of the legality of the debt has been raised in a second. case, purposely selected to try it, and the Supreme Court has not only repealed its decision, but declared tlhat even the taxes raised to pay the interest are illegal, and may be resisted. Since the decision some discouraging " developments " have come to light, -well calculated to make men keep their money in their pockets. The sum appropriated for the payment of the dividends, dueL here last Jnly, has been embezzled; twice that atnount, intended to cover those dividends and the payments of next July, has disappeared. The Treasurer of the State and the Controller are both in prison and under impeachment for swindling-it is as well to call things by their right names-rand the ControUer's clerk has left for 4" parts unknown." The public begins to question the prudence of trusting the disposal of above $3,000,000 to such hands, and argues, " it will all go the same way, tha creditors will be none the better, and we all the worse !" The reasoning is verynatural, but for the bondbolders perilous. hen the country districts, the farmers and miners, care very little about the credit of the State; to them it is an abstraction and they will not sacrifice anything to mnintain it. They say, if the merchants of San Francisco want; credit for the :3tate, they should have kept it when they had it, and not allowed the political machinery to lift into office so many scoundrels. The Legislature would wiUingly pass an Act, assuming the debt and providing for its payment, but it has not the power; the decision of the Court is imperative; the question must be submitted to the people throughout the whole State. This the Legislature shrinks from doing from apprehension of the result. The decision must come from the people, and cannot be taken before September. If the popular voice refuses to recognize the debt, the process of repudiation will be complete, and the time that must elapse before the vote is taken wiUl, it is feared, not increase the chances of the creditors.

Sir,-Observing in The 2inw of this day a lotter from Our gifted correspondent in the Crimea relat*e to Mrs. ca colo, in which a misapprehension of a nmatter of fact is made so prominent as to prejudice the old lady in the minds of her miiitary friends, I take the first opportunity of cor-
" iw. H. R." ascribes tbo bankruptcy of Mrs. Seacole. among other causes, to the non-payment of the bills cashed by her for the officors who patronized her in the Crimea, the fact being that the amount at risk under this head never e;ceeded 1001., and is at the present moment under 501.
The principal causes of the bankruptcy, as proved to the satisfaction of the official and trade assignees, were losses by the elemnents and by robbery, and tho depreciation of stockin-trade and buildings consequent on tho unexpectedly rapid evacuation of the Crimea on the conclusion of the war.
With regard to the deserts of Mrs. Seacole no one knows better than inyself that they are not overstated by the " l'en vof the War," and I much regret that any circumstances ehould have prevented the appcal in her behalf to the public fron being made at an oarhlerdate,vwhen the subscriptiona wrould probably have reached the thousands she deserves. instead of being limited, zs I fear It v.ill no v be, to a fewhu ndreds.

PARIS, APRIL 12, 6 P.?{.
Despatches were received yesterday at the Foreignoffice from M. de Bourqueney, the French Ambs.- sador at Vienna. It is again said that there are hopes of the differences between the Austrian and Sardinian Governments being arrangecl through the friendly intervention of the other Powers. I cannot say on what foundation those expectations rest. I have no doubt that England and ance are anxious to see friendly relations restored, and would do their beat towards that object, but the causes of jealousY and discontent are too deep to be easily removed
Between Austria and Piedmnont appearances may be I kept up, but a good feeling cannot for a long time .be sincere on either side.
M. de Kisseleff leaves on the 20th for Toulon, in order to meet the Grand Duke Constantine, and the Ohaplain-General of the Fleet on the 16th, for the same purose. M. Fould, Mlinister of the Imperial Household, went yesterday to Fontainebleau to direct the preparations for the festivities which are to take place there on the Grand Duke's arrival. Captain Tchigir, of the Russian navy, who, I believe, was Secretary of the Admiralty at Nicholaieft duriug the Crimean war, haa arrived in Paris. General Todtleben dines to-day at the Tuileries, and Marshal VailMant, Minister of Way, gives a grand dinner on Tuesday, in honour of the same General.
The Director of the Imperial Foundry at Indret, wbich is a branch of the naval establishment, has been officially informed that the Grand Duke will visit that place during his stay in France.
The meeting of the Spanish Cortes, now so near, is looked forwvard to with considerable curiosity by those who still take an interest in Peninsular affairs. The Chamber of Deputies, packed as it is by the systematic and shameful violation of every promise and pledge, and the most barefaced dis-
gard of everything like law or morality, may not present during the brief existence that in all likelihood wil be accorded to it any violent collision between political parties, for there the element of op-
osition is reduced nearly to zero. It is rather to the Senate that our eyes are turned, and it is there that will probably be exhibited the conflict between those who have been ejected from power by acts which they themselves had employed to overthrow their predecessors. If confusion, hatred, and mutual vituperation among their enemnies and oppressors be a consolation to the few honest and patriotic menwho have attemptedtoform a free Government in this ill-fated country, that feeling promises to be gratified. To the haters of liberal institutions the scenes that are expected to take place, similar to those which hastened the outbreak of 1854, must afford the same enjoyment that the ravings of the Helots gave to the Spartans of old; and they may point to those scenes as a lesson and a warning to their own submi6sive people. Yet, as nothing that occurs in Spain takes any one by surprise, and as events commonly bappen there the most opposed to aU preconceived notions, no one can evennow be sure that the general expectation will not be disappointed. Were Narvaez the man he was somelOorl2years ago, did he possess but a small part of that inexorable wlll and fierce energy which friends and enemies once endowed him with, the danger which is impending over him would be dissipated by means wMh& were in other times so familiar to him. O'Donnell has withdrawn into retirement, in order to forge the thunderbolts which it is said he means to hurl at the head of his successful rivaL O'Donnell, who is a man not apt to forgive any one who crosses his path, is doubtless very weU disposed for a violent onslaught on Narvaez in the Senate, but he is at the same time in a difficult nosition, as he wiU have but a small number ,of persoial folowers in it to support him. However,
he must evidently think, right or wrong, that out of the Cortes he has considerable support somewheresome say vith the Queen, others with the army. O'Donnell, who knows both well, probably feels that the one prop is as frail as the other; and I suspect that, after all that has occurred, neither the Queen nor the army has any very strong preference for either Narvaez or O'Donnell, and probably think it is " sim of one and a half-dozen of the other." But what would touch the heart of the former would be a MiniAtry under Bravo MuriUlo, and the only thing that would win, really win, the sympathies of the latter is the promise of two years' reduction of service-a bait which no Spanish army ever can witbstand.
There is little doubt that the Carlists expect great things in their favour, partly from the Court and partly from some attempts in the provinces. In
'rance their sgents have been trying to gain over some of the discontented Liberals. The new confessor of the Queen, the Archbishop of Cuba, is precisely the man to assist them. Most people suppose that the fraction headed by Bravo MuriUo and Beltran de Lis in the Cortes will end by being in the ascendant, sbould the Parliament live for a session or two. This party will undoubtedly try a retrograde reform in the Constitution, and then, as Sancho Panza would say, "1luede la bola,"-let the bal roll on. I think it is pretty certain that there wil be another act to the melodrama before the curtain faUs.
A letter from Jassy of the 30th March gives the manifesto published by the electoral committee of the capital of Moldavia. It advocates :-l. The union of the provinces into a single State, reserving the rights of the Sublime Porte according to the spirit and the letter of the ancient stipulations. 2. The neutrality of the territory of the Principalities. 3. Respect for the rights of the Principalities according to the spirit and letter of the same treaties. 4. HIereditary succession of the chief of the State. The Hospodariate has served its time-an European system ought to succeed it. 5. The legislative power confided to a single General Assembly, which will represent the interests of the entire nation. 0. Submission of foreigners inhabiting the Principalities to all the laws of the country. 7. The acknowledgment of the right of the Principalitieis to establish comnmercial relations according to their interests. 8. All these to be under the coUective guarantee of the Powers who signed the Treaty of Paris.
The following private telegraphic despatches have been received:-

General Pianelli, who is married to a dcaughter of Count Rudolf, is to be seen every day walldng in the streets of Naples. According to the same letter the author of the false proclamation posted during the night In the streets of Naples, having the 'inature of the Ministers and the Royal seal attached, hs been arreated. He is a young printer-he admits the fact, but denies that he ban any accomplices. The press and proof sheets of the proclamation have likewise been seized.
AUSTRIA.
(FROM OUR OWN ConEs1orNDKT.)
VIENN4A, AzRx 10.
Some of the German papers are informed by their Vienna correspondents that the diplomatic relations between Austria and Sardinia are likely soon to be renewed, but nothing of this is known in diplomatic
cirles. The French Government has been extremely active here, but its endeavours to persade the Austrians to be reconciled to their Sardinian neighbours have totally failed. Directly after his return from Turin Count Paar had an audience of the
3mperor, and he is said to have informed His Majesty that there was little hope of any change in the policy of the Sardinian Government. The language used in Austrian official circles is, that the diplomatic relations between the two Governments will not be renewed unti the satisfaction demanded in Count Buol's notes of February 10 and March 16 has been given by Count Cavour.
The Paris papers have recently assured their readers that the opinions of the British and Turkish Governments in respect to the union of the Danubian Principalities have undergone a very considerable change, but reliable information has been given me that such is not the case. The Britiah Cabinet is not so much averse to the idea of the union as Austria, but it has not lost sight of the fact that its realization must mainly depend on the Porte, as the Suzerain Power. The prevalent opinion here is that concessions will be made on both sides. According to reliable letters from Jary, the agitation in favour of the union is less systematicaly carried on In Moldavia than in Wallachia.
At length an authentic account has been obtained of what happened about a fortnight since in the ante-room of the audience chamber of the Emperor. There was no question of a plot against H is Majesty, as wil be seen by the following simple statement of facts :-A couple of years ago a Slave, from the neighbourhood of Comorn, applied for and obtained an audience of the Emperor. The man, a grower
oftobacco, complaied of bad times, heavy taxes, &c., and at length obtained some trifling pecuniary assistance. A few months after he returned, aud managed to obtain access to the waiting-room of the audience chamber, where he told a long story made
up of complats against the employgs in general,
and of charges against the persons whose duty it is to take note of the quantity of tobacco grown in particular. So much noise waa made that the
Emperor sent to inquire what was going da, and as the petitioner endeavoured to force his way into the presence of His Majesty he was ejected from the room, and sent back to his place of
residence with orders not to quit it without previously obtaining perniasion from the authorities so to do. About a fortnight or 10 days ago the Slave again forced his war into the waiting-room, and was
again "walked off by the Gendarmes in waiting.
The man, who was accompanied by two of hu friends, will probably be imprisoned for some weeks, as he came to Vienna without the knowledge of the
police.
Yesterday the eremony of "The Washing of FeetJ' took place at Court. At 9 o'clock in the
morning 24 old people-12 men and as many women -who were dressed in the ancienlt German costume, were conducted to the " Hall of Ceremony" (Ceremnnien Saal) of the Palace. On their arrival the men were placed on one side of a long table, and the women on the other. As soon as the seniors had taken their seats their Majesties entered, and placed before them a great number of dishes, which were brought in trays by the Imperial servers. The Emperor handled the " crockery" in a masterly way, but the Empress required the assistance of her
ladies. After the dishes had been set on the table they were removed and placed in 24 large baskets, which were sent to the rooms occupied by the paupers in the almahouse. At 10 @clock the wasing of feet began in the chapel of the Palace. The Emperor performed the ceremony on the above-mentioned 12 old men, and the Empress on the women. His Majesty re-
ceived from the hands of his Lord Steward a gilt ewer, and poured from it a few drops of water on one of the feet of each of the men. After a towel had been pressed once or twice on each of the wetted feet, and a little bag containing 32 silver groats had been hung round the necks of the old people, the ceremony was at an end. Her Majesty, who was attended by her Lord Steward, acted in exactly the same way as her ImperiaI consort.
The Austrian and Ger an pers continue to assert that a complete chain of fortifications is about to be construted in Galicia; but the very persons whose duty it would be to carry out the works declare that there ia no truth in the current
report. What Is now stated applies to fortifications which it was proposed to construct in 1855.
The VenetiaDs are very wrath that Count Pisani has sold his Paul Veronese to the British Government. Alexander, Darius, and the other personages represented are said to be portraits of members of the Pisani family.
After having sat for one month the Wurtemberg Chambers have been prorogued.
Lady Seymour leaves for London to-morrow, with her children; but Sir Hamilton, who appears to be a very hardworldng and conscientious public servant, remains at his post.
A few hours ago there was an impression on my mind that Russia and Austria had come to an understanding on the Montenegrin question, but positive information has now been received that such is not the case. The St. Petersbura Cabinet protects M. George Petrovitch, the Preident of the Senate, because that personage, who is the leader of a very powerful party in Montenegro is resolved never to
acknowledge the supremacy o2 the Porte. Austria
on the contrary, favoursth at p sarty in the prinipality which, for a valuable consideration, would consent to recognize the suzeraine of the Sultan,
Abdul Medjhid. The opinion8 entertained by tbis Government in resPect to Montenegro and its in-
habitants may be given in a very few lines. The Montenegrins, who were formerly designated "heroic hristians oppressed by the Porte," are now "s Bemi-barbarous freebooters,"7 to whoma certain territorial concessions ought, for the
sake of peace and quiet, to be made. . It is a positive fact that the preduce of themojin-
tainftous country known as Montenegro is inadeqaate to the maintenance of its inhabitants, and the 'ustrian Government, therefore, advises the TurkLsh Government to annex to itnsuch portions of the' ad joining lowlands as would enable the, people to live
at hoiae in peac ce instead Of making inioad s inito th o. Herzegovina and Albania in quest of the necessaries Of life. It is not positively kown what districit Prince Da Dlel wishes to have ananxed to is pAnl-

Russia towards Montenegro, which contain the folloWing passages:-
" As Russia wishes to weaken Turkey, she thinks. it will be better to let the Montenegrins have little to eat, and so force them to wage a continual guerills war against thi
Turis. Austria, on the contrary, thinks it would be we'! to give them the possibility of satiating their hunger,. without disturbing the peace of their neighbours. When in 1852, Omar Pasha menaced to turn Montenegro into a Turkish pashaijo, Austia entered a most serious pro test against the plan,* but she never intended that the rapacious and predatory habits of the mountaineers shodf'd become permanent. The Imperial Government is well inclined to Montenegro, but it is not of opinion that ibis necessary to establish an 'independent' miniature Stato, peopled by starvelings and thievish vagabonds, in a remote corner of Europe. As to Tarkish tyranny, it is entirely out of the question in a country that is not only almost inaccessible, but in which no Mussulmn is allowed to reside.'
PRUSSIA.
(FROM OURh OWN CORRFSPONDZNT.)
BERLIN, APriL, 9.
The last vessel that paid Sound Dues was the British screw steamer Shamrock, bound from Rostook to Hull with a cargo of wheat. The firat vessel that passed the Sound without paying dues was the Prussian schooner Graf von Schwerin, bound from Stettin for England, also with a cargo o' wheat. Both these vessels passed the Sound going outwards. The first vessel that passed the Sound inwards duty free was the British screr steamer Gertrude, bound for Stettin; and in honour of the oocasion a private party from that port went out to meet her in a steamer, and welcomed her arrival under these improved auspiees of the redemptioni of the Dues. Te official reejoicings which the municipality of Stettin had prepared wecre defeiwed, naturally enough, for the first Prussian vessel that passed the Sound inwards duty free. This was the screwv steamer Tilsit wrhich passed the Sound on the 6th inst,, and was receied on approaching Swinemunde by three steamera with all tbe members of thc body corporate of merchants on board, with hundreds of passenge civic authorities, bands of music, flags, &c. A the vessels the nautical procession would have to p and all houses on the coast and quays were rigged out with every species of bunting that could be procured, and as much noise was made as was possible for the money by dint of hurrahs, brass bands, and small pieces of artillery. Accompanied by these satisfactory and " stunning" demonstrations, the a-dval of the Tilsit inaugurated a new era in the trade of Stettin.
The Danish Rigaraad, or General Council for the entire Monarchy, met on the 3dinst. in Copenhagen,, to deliberate on the ratification of the main treaty for the redemption of the Sound Dues, several of the separate treaties regulating the modus of payment, and certain other small matters of minor importance. On the 4th the Sound Dues treaties were laid before the Council and referred to a committee to report upon. The Mnister of Finance then made a statement as to what the Government intended to do with the amount of 31,000,000 Reichs Bank thalers, which the redemption of the dues will soone4r or later bring into its coffers. The Sound Duse have hitherto figured in the budget as producing as
income of 2,034,000 Reicha =ank thalers; thjs amount forms the first item of the future deficit; to'. it must be added 175,000 Reichs Bank thaler%
arising from the diminution of the land transit dues; and 60,000 Reichs Bank thalers from the abolition of the dues on the Eider Canal; total, 2,275,000 Reichs Bank thalers. To this sum must be added for many years to come the pensions to be p aid to official deprived of their offices by the aboltion of the dues, which, together with the amounts hitherto paid out of the gross amount of the Sound Dues, will bring up the deficit to about 2,900,000 Reichs Bank thalers. Towrards this annLual deficit the Goverment propos to take the sum of 1,200,000 Reichs Bank thalers out of the interest aotting from the 31,000,000; t>he rest will, as far as at present appears, have to be made up by increased taxations. A further portion of the interest is to be devoted to undertakings required by the consideration of the public welfare. The Minister of Finance has also applied for a Bill to empower himn to use such porthons of the capital aS canxnot be beneficially invested in the paying off of any amounts of the public debt as are open to redemption, and this projecV seema in the first instance intended to be carried out with reference to the London loans of 1849 and 1850.
In Sweden they continue to collect subscriptions for the starving sufferers in Finland and the north of Sweden. Including 10,000PRicha Bank thalers that were forwarded from Stockholm on the 31st ult., that capital had contributed no less than 47,750 Reichs Bank thalers to the alleviation of the dearth. A callection in the Swedish church in London is stated also to have produced 301. An official report sent in by the Swedish Governor in Norbottens-Lmn to his Government affirms that the statements that have appeared of late in Beenska Ticainges about the fearfu ravages of the famine were exaggerated. Advices also from Helsingfora state that, among all the reports sent in by the cilergy at the request of the Finland Senate there was no mention made of a single case of death from starvation. Those, therefore, who live at a distance, andlack either the will or the means to help, may lay the soothing unction to theirso0ulathat " perhaps it wasnot all so bad as was represented."

TRIN, APRIL 7.
The following particulars regarding the Convents suppressed by the law of Last session are gathered from the official report of the Director of the Ecclesiastical Fund established at the same time .-
The number of religious orders of males possessing property in the tera-jlrma States affected by the first article of the said law are fourteen, i.e., the Agostiniani with shoes, the Agostiniani without shoes, the Benedettini Cassinesi, the Canonisi Rcgolari Lateranensi, the Carmeletaniwithout shoei, the Certosini, the Ctercensi t-he Domenicani, the Conventuali, the Minlmni, the 1ippini,thoOlivetan;, the Ob]ati and the Servi. They occupied 68 houses, and, when the Commsion took possession, there were 557 priests, 215 lay brethren, and 9 sering novices and servants, giving a total of 781 persons, or an average of 11 persons to each house. The number of female relgious orders in the terrafirma States affected by the same law is 11-the Angostiniane, the Battistine, the Benedettine Cassinese, the Canonichesse Lateranense, the Carmelitane without shoes, the Celestine, the Chiarisse, the Cistercense, the Crocifisse, the Domenicane, and the Terziarie Domenicane. They owned 46 houses and numbered 1,085 persons, of whom 814 were "coriste," or adnittec nunls; 265 " converse" or persons in a probationary state, and six novices or servants. They averaged 23 persons to each convent, or more than double the number averaged by the male orders.
The 66 convents inhabited by the possessing monks were found to contain 3 905 clhambers, and to be of an aggregate value of 49,757f. Between houses, lnnds, capital, and other soure the gross receipts were G68,685f. 63t., of wrhich abouta-itah was in houses, and more than thehalf in rural possesions to the anount of 4,932 hectares of land, the rent of which at the time of the promulgation of the law did not average more than 77f. the hectare. Comparig the total of rural possessions with the number of families to which it belonged
there appears an average of 75 hectsres to each family. The rent derived from capital and credits
of various kdnds amounted to 106,488f. 21c., or* about 1,596f. for each family. The debts of aU'll sorts contracted by the administrators of the male orders amounted to 216,640f. 42c., so that the net rent, exclusive of the value of the monasteries, was 452,045f. 21c.
The estimated rent of the 46 convents occupied by the nuns in possession smounted-altogether to 73,145f. or an -average of 1,590f. to each convent, a value equal to double that of the monasteries. Comparatively, the gross rent Is still greater onthe whole of the different categories of properb-, amounting to 514,609f. 76c., of which 292,870f. is
derived from rural waions to the extent f.f 2,783 hectares of land The debts in five of the male religious ordem absorbed a third of their gross income, while thoeo of the female orders hardly exceeded a fourth. The net revenues of the latter were found to amountto 389,155f.
In the Island of Saidinia the male orders affect d by the law wre sevenl in number, occupying Mi houses, and the femalec two, writh nine house. Thc first comprehend 322 pe§rsns, the second 166. Thb estimated refiof the holo 'of tha monasteries and nve~ts so o spid is yeT smal.' There were
attached to them 1,054 other building, andu 3,262 hiectares of land.
The houses of the mendicant orders suppreased amount to 183, of which 136 are in the terra-firma States and 47 in the Island of Sardinia. The total number of members of these orders is 3,135, of whom 175 are women and 2,960 men. Of the latter 1,709 are priests (sacerdoti), 983 laymen, and 268 between novices and servants. In general, the value of the convents of the mendicant orders is found to be very trifling. Theypossess, however, other property which produces a rent of 83,804f. 36c.
There are 66 collegiate churches affected by the law, comprising altogether 650 canonries, so that there is an average of 10 canonries for each church, or about one for 6,500 souls. These canonries have a net rent, varying from 150f. to 1,800f. The smallest are in the province of Liguria, and the xichest in those of lNovara, Verceli, and Tuiin.
As to the simple benefices, the Commision has not yet been able to take possession of them, bat they are calculated to number about 1,700.
The following notice appears in thePiedmonese Gazete of this d:-" A pamphlet has lately been published entitled D; Bel Nuov& sula Spez, Terzo ed Ulimo Argomento. The Government does not intend to refute the errors which abound id this namphiet. The discussion that will take place beiore long in Parliament will offer occasion for showing the serious reasons that may be alleged on this " argment '" bult it is the duty of the Government to declare.that'what is nauerted in a note of the said pamphlet regarding the conduct in the month of April, 3849, at Genoa, of th6 - commander of an Englih man-of-war, the Vengeance, LordEaarwicke, is contrary to the fact. He placed his vessel under the battery of the Campanella, thereby shorwing that he did not fear the menaces of those who had ordered him to leave ; but he never intended to destroy theArsenal, whicbi, a few days before, he had contributed to save by lending aid to the Director of the Prison in maintaining order among the condemned. His Mojesty the King has been pleased to manifest his acknowledgment of lord Hardwicle's services by conferring an honorary distiction on him."
The Roman Minister-of Public Works, Monsignor Milesi, has addremsed a circular to the delegates and presidentts of the provinces regarding subscriptions for shares in the railways from Rome to Civita Vecchia and Ihome to Ferrara, rid Foligno, Ancona, and Bologna, exhorting them to persuade all persons in their districts to follow the example of His Holiness Pius 1X, who had been the first to contribute. Among the reasons which Monsignor Milesi says induced His-Holiness to adopt this course was, that "the extension of railways becoming every day greater, it was impossible any longer to defer their application to the States of the Church, so that Rome, th'e centre of the true religion, might be easy of access to those who gothere to worship the tombs of the Apostles, wad to console themselves by the presence of the Vicar of Jesus Christ."
The shares are of 600f. each. The guaranteed Interest is to commence from the first payment. The far-s call will be for 150f. Until the oompletion of the line from lRome to Civita Vecchia there wiU be; no second call, and in consequence the second .call (of 100 francs) wil1 not be made until thelatter half of 1858, and there wll not be another until the completion of the line from Rome to Ancona.
lBut, although these railways will certainly be a great advantage to all good Christians and many heretics as wrell, it may be allowed to doubt the correctness of the calculation on wfhich the interest of 7 per cent. is founded on the estimated cost of 300,000 francs per kilometre.

MADRID, AP= 8.
Marshal (YDonneU has retired to a country house he possesses at a short distance from Mabdrid, and is preparing for the meeting of the Cortes, with the assistance of a few political friends v;ho gather round him there. I believe there is no truth in the report that he proposes publishing a manifesto but it is certain that he yesterday began to sketch the speech he proposes to make in the Senate. The Count de Lucena is a man of impetuous and excitable temper and a fluent speaker, and he wishes to guard himselfbyprevlous preparation against saying more than he intends. There can be scareely a doubt that his speech will include severe strictures on his rival, Narvaez. Indeed, it is well known that the latter dreads therCortes, anticipating, and with good reason, a series of most damaging attacks As it is, his prestige has dwindled almost to nothing; people talk of him as used up and effete, and we may easily judge what a sorry figure he wil cut when he hasbeen dragged to and fro and vitu-
prated by the angry Vicalvarist Generals. he general conviction of the diffienlty of his situation leads to continual reports of changes of Ministry. If he could get a aood fighting Cabinet, men sharp of tongue and ready of speech, and able to retaliate effectively on his assailants,ae mightmeet the Senatewith less discomposure than the thought of the encounter at present occasions hinm. The latest rumour that has reached me is to the effect that most of the present Ministers are to go out; that Bermudez de Castro is to have the Foreign Affairs; Pidal, the Interior; Mon, the Ftinance; and Anmero, the Marine. It is stated positively that a courier started for Rome the nightbefore last to induce Mon to accept this arrangement,which, it is thought, may be difficult, as he aspires to be Premier, and cannot forget that he vFas once kicked or beaten by the Duke of Valencia, then his colleague. Itl is among possibilities that there may be an understanding that Narvaez shall ghortly give up to bimthe presideneyofthe Counciland take the Paris Embassy, which it is generally believed he desires, but wishes, before exchanging for it his present post, to arrange a Ministry that will maintain him in his new one, and have some chance of durability.
The Progresis are dissatisfied with themselves for having meddled and put forward candidates at the elections. From the first a portion of them were for remaining entirely aloof, and in many districts this was done, but between 30 and 40 Progresistas stood to be elected, only five of whom were returned. The illegitimate manceuvres of the Government are notorious, and have been repeatedly proved and exposed, but it is also certain that the Progresista electors were very lukewarm, and that a great many of them would not go to the poll, while some aetually gave their votes for Government candidates.
This unfortunate party, which could do nothingI when in power, is utt.erly demoralized and disorganized by its reverses and by the disappointment it lhas felt at the conduct of its once revered chlef. It stil, in spite of depoaitions and defeo. tions, reckons a few men of ability and sense in its ranks, but they are 1ost in the mob of incapables, and their voices are unheard in the clamorous dis. cord of the groups into which the party has split.
The acquittal of the Iberwa newspaper is said to be due in great part to a violent article against O'Donnell, which it published a few days ago. Narvaez thought it would not do to be too hard upon a paper which could deal such hard blows to his enemy, and he gave directions aecordingly. to the Tribunal, which wouldprobably not have dared to acquit without Government austhorization, since. it is composed of judges named and unnamed by Government; and we have recently had abundant proofs that an act of disobedience is pretty sure to lead to dismissal. The Iberia is said, even by the
krgresatas, to have written the articl on O'Donnell in -expectation of its producing a mnollifying effect, and getting the paper let off esiy.
The Fenix, one of the inmumerable trashy journals that have lately sprung up in Madrid; and which was founded by Don Jesus Muno;, brother-in-law of Queen Christina, and is supposed to represent the' views 'and interests of the Rianzares family, is Iwriting upconstitutional government and crying, E liroupon the Absolutitsb. This agrees with the.
tenour of Christina's recent letters to her daughter., One Alfaro,.a Polaco, who feathered his nest as a Goveinment ernp?eye in the honest and golden days of Sartorius, isthe editor of the Fenix, as he was. in former days of the notorious Posdata.
Altogether nothing can exoeed the sort of pol-. tical anarchy that exists here in parties and- in the' prbes, the utter want of common sense, of comnirn cdosistency, and, above all, of common honesty.

A brother of Marshal Serrano has just died; it is thought that this may accelerate the latter's return.to Madrid. It is reported that General Jose Concha will come here to take his place in the Senate, and viill be replaced, as Captain-General of the island of Cuba, by General Lemery, who lately commanded at Porto Rico, and who is one of the few officers of rank in Spain who has never meddled in I politics, but has always confined himself to his mili-

LISBON, APRIL L
Since the approval of the bill suppressing the Literary Subsidy Ttax, principally levied upon the winegrowers, the Deputies have been discussing the Ministerial project for the extinction of the soap contract and, the admission of foreign soap after the 1st July, 1858, at a duty of about a halfpenny per pound for common, aud 3d. per pound for line qualities.
The general principles of this bill were unanimously approved, and its different clauses are being passed by large majorities, although much debate and recrimination have arisen between the late Ministers and partisans of the present Cabinet. The bill had been introduced last session by M. Fontes, when he proposed to avail of the bank-note tax for the purpose of rescinding the existing soap contract, and indemnifying the contractors, but M. Avila, the present Minister of Finance, proposes to continue the contract to its close in June, 1858, and to apply the note-tax to public works, viz., 12 per cent. upon Custom-house duties, and 10 per cent. upon all other imposts. This tax, originally introduced for the purpose of withdrawing the Lisbon Bank notes from circulation, is now to be continued in metal; and, although the notes are nearly aU cancelled, the tax will, no doubt, be kept up as a source of revenue long-after they cease to exist. Some divisions have already taken place upon different clauses of this bill, which indicate the relative strength of parties in the House, and prove that the Ministers will have a large xiajority as long as the coalition holds good between the Progresistas, represented in the Cabinet by the Marquis de Loul6, and the Conservative Chartists, represented by M. Avila. The largest number of votes in opposition to the Government were given yesterday, viz., 36 against 78, upon an amendment M. Fontes proposed in regard to the application given tothe bank-note tax, which he lost by a majority of 42.
M. Avila defended himself successfully for adopting measures introduced by the previous Administration. He showed that he had approved many acts of that Administration, and among others the bills for suppressing the literary subsidy-tax and soap contract, which had last session been favourablyreported onbyhim as a member of the Finance Committee; he was nothowever so suceesefulin justifying the continuation of the bank-note tax, in a form which tends to increase the high tariff of import duties, to the great benefit of the smuggler and equally to the prejudice of legitimate trade aud the public revenue.
The ordinary session of the Cortes expiring at the end of March, the King issued a decree to keep the Legislature open until the end of April, nor is there any chance of public business being then concluded, although the new Ministers of Finance and Public Works are naturally anxious to confine themselves to the most urgent bills, in order that an early reces
may give them time 'o study the necessities of their important departments.
The Santarem Railway and the new lproposals from Mr. Peto and the Portuguese Cnrdit Mobilier Company for a continuation of the line cannot but be embarrassing to the new Ministers, who had, as Opposition Deputies, taken a prominent part in the debates last year upon the questions sthll at issue between the English contractors and the company, or rather the Government, which may, in this case, be said to stand for the company. I have heard it suggested by some influential deputies that a bill should be passed this session authorizing the Govermment to settle within oertain limits the old differences and the contracts now necessary to continue the railway from Santarem to Oporto, if not to the Spanish frontier, and I think this would be the most practicable and judicious way of closing a very difficult and complicated question.
The Portuguese frigate Don Fernando leaves to-day with troops for Mozambique, and a small body of about 300 men is being prepared for Macao, which the Portuguese begin to feel the necessity of protecting with a larger force than formerly. It is, however, an unprofitable pOssession, and is likely to continue so as long as it remains in the hands of Portugal.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOR OP THE TIMES.
Sir,-Will you allow me to offer a few remarks on the question at issue between " P." and " Young Amerlca "2
The Niagara's engines are only of 600 horse-powver. The greatest speed attained on her first trial, accordingtothe roport I have seen, was 11. knots. It was said, howover, that she would make one knot more when in proper trim. Her engines appear but small to propol the ]argest ship of war in the world, especially when contrasted with some new English and French frigates, the machinery of which is much superor, even at the same nominal power.
If the 'crrimac ever carries 60 guns they must be much llghber than her present armament, or her speed, such as it is, will be diminishied and the ship probably injured. "Young America" will rememberthat the Constitution was built to carry 62 guns, then reduced to 56, and finally to 50, as the ship was found to "hog" considerably.
Now, let us compare her with our new frigate Diadem. The Herrimac has only two 10-inch guns, 24 9-inch, and 14 8-inch ' her engines are of 600 horse-power to a tonnage of I thlni) about 3,100 Enulish. The Diadem has 20 10-inch,
long 68s, and 10 32s; her horse power is 800 h less than 2,500 tons. Itwiillbe seen that she could oppose 12 long-rango guns to the lMerriinae' two, and her speed will be mush greater, prohably 14 hnots (the Shanon, &c., made 12 writh only 600 horse-power to 2,6150 tons).
Can " Young America" tell me whyhis Government build no mere Niagaras ?
I am, Sir. your obedient servant.

SOUR GRAPES.-We believe the Conservative party
SOUB GRAnPs.-We believe theCon8ervative party may well afford to wait the course of events with calmness. In the Liberal niajority are included a suaficient number of moderate men to prevent the Introduction of changes of a dangerous character. From other changes the Corservatives have nothing to dread. Even as repets electoral reform, the Bill of 1832 was so designedly unfair to interests essen. tMy Conservative, It gave such undue preponderance to urban populations in the representatlve system, that it is almost impossible for any change to be otherwise than favourable to tho Conservative prty Any degradation of the existing suffrage is not likey to enlist such an amount of support in its favour as would secure its success* while to any fair extesiAon of the existing snffragp, or to axy such modcifiation of the electoral system as would tend to give'
ter weight to intelligence5 character, and station, the Conservative party would certainly not be opposed. 'In the presence of an imposing majority the Opposition will, we imagine, neither court conflict nor shrink from the am,ssertion of its principles A time will come when the public must think that constitntional changvs have been carried far enough-when thoy will be disgusted with a foreign plicy which involves the country In neodless quarrels and sullies its honouz when their eyes Will be opened to the folly of a systematic and profuse expenditnre, wich not only impose unnecesmry taxation, but which renders a large deficit certan, and imperilk the national crodit--when they deiire to see their Government really and honestly conducted upon the principles announced by .the leaders of Opposition"hononrable pae, reduoed taxatlon, social improvemerii

Memoirs Of Sir Robert Peel.*
4EMOIR8 OF SIR ROBERT PEEL.*
The second, and happily the last, volume of those memoirs on public affairs which Sir Robert Peel himtelf drew up for his posthumous vindication having been recently published by his executors, as enjomned by him, we must give some account of its tenour and bearings. But we must, first of an, endeavour to translate into English the meaning conveyed with such circumlocution in a vaporous and diplomatic phraseology which is inadequate to the common purposes of life. It is the misfortune of his readers now, as it was often that of his hearers in his lifetime, that Sir Robert Peel's conc,ptions, however clear, were clothed in such a nebulous mass of verbiage that we have to probe and- disengage them to get at their aubstance. Briefly, it is like blowing the froth from a syllabub, or squeezing the liquor out of a sponge, or draining drop by drop the product of a jelly bag. For Sir Robert Peel's language was not the language of commonmenintheirordinaryintercourse, butitwastheintricate envelope of a statesman of great importance, and of aman perhaps morenervouslyconscious of that importance than any other individual known to history. It was his protection, like that of the cuttlefish, to surround himself with this species of personal distillation as a refuge against danger or a cloak for his timidity, and his meaning was thus diluted or diffised, and dissolved rather than expressed in parts of speechL The language of most official men in official documents is flowing and colourless; it serves as a sort of solvent to their real intentions. But Sir Robert Peel used up more of this departmental gum in communicating his ideas than any of his contemporaries. Each of his sentences is a sort of official jujube, and a mass of jLuch jujubes compose the records of even the most 0onfidential phases of his public life.
We must dissolve these irreverently to get at their essence, and this process we now undertake for our readers. The present volume contains two memoirs -one on the grounds of Sir Robert's assumption of the Govenment in 1834, and the other on his conduct with reference to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 184-6G. We commence with the former.
On the 11th of July, 1834, Lord Melbourne made to Sif R. Peel a secret communication by the desire of the Ring, who, now that Lords Grey and Althorp were out, was desirous of including the chief Conservatives in his new Ministry. Lord Melbourne did not share the King's wishes, and regarded the proposed combination as hopeless. He thereupon expresed himself to this effect, and elicited a similar expression from Sir Robert, which was transmitted to the King to His Majesty's disappointment. Sir Robert was acting in concert with the Duke, with whom he was, however, ready to take office on their separate account, and he has added a memorandumi which flows into the form of a jujube in announcing the policy which ke " for one" would then have followed.
Sir Robert (in plain language), concluding that the pear was not ripe, left England for Italy on the 14th of October, 1834, and was surprised at Rome by receiving the King's commands to return at once and become his Prime Minister. In the meantime, however, Lord Spencer had died, Lord Althorp had been called tb the Upper House, and "'probabilities " which the King a ppears promptly to have insisted on had induced His Majesty to send for the Duke of Wellington. But the Duke of Wellington had taken a view of his future relations to Sir Robert which the latter acquiesced in with less hesitation than the King himself did. The Duke, that is to say, had proposed Sir Robert as his chief, though it is not stated whether he had any premonitions of the usual circumlocutory class, to the effect that Sir Robert was unwilling to remain his subordinate. We refer to this because we have been distinctly informed that such was the case, and if it was so it is quite consistent that the Duke and Sir Robert should take this matter for granted in their mutual communications. In other respects these communications are highly characteristic. The Duke's are frank and curta
he calls the King's difficulty with his Minibters " a quarrel ;" says " he (meaning the King) is in such a hurry to get rid of them ;" that they are "sulky enough ;" that Peel will find "the Tories, Tory Lords in particular, very well disposed to go all reasonable lengtbs,"&c.- that he (the Duke) has been " astonished at their being so doeile," and that in the meantime he is filling all the great offices, as it was necessary " to take possession." Peel, on the other hand, writes briefly and drily, but he crosses the Alps summd diligentid, and having had, as he says, ample oppor tunity for consideringmatters "coolly" during his jourmey, he informs His Majesty on his arrival that he "does not feel himself justified, in the present position of public affairs, in withholding any services which it may be in his power to render." But he takes at the same time a clear view of his position and its difficulties, makes a reasonable, though unsuccessful, offer of offiee to Lord Stanley and Sir James Graham, thereupon fulfils " the most paiifuZ duty' of selecting his colleagues, decides in favour of a dissolution, and issues a Tamworth manifesto.
The manifesto has various important bearings. It of course, wore suo, places in the foreground " the heavy sacrifices" involved in the power and distinction conferred on the v'riter. But the King had required his services in a crisis of great difficulty, and how could he hesitate ? To assume that he was morally disqualified in consequence of the Reform Bill would be to question the good sense of the people and to fetter the prerogative. Moreover, his opinions and those of his coleagues might not be at variance with those of the constituencies. At all events, to secure their confidence he will frankly and explicitly declare his principles.
He is no " apostate ;" he has ?weer been " the defender of abuses" (his declaration on this head we shall auote and consider presently) ; he accepts the Reform Bill as " final and irrevocable," and is 'willing to act in its spirit if its spirit implies " the maintenance of established rights," with "the correction of proved abuses and the redress of real grievances." "To apply this declaration practically," he Iwil not oppose the inquiry into Municipal Corporations, and he wil give to the evidence and the suggestions of the Report " a full and unprejudiced consideration." These are the limits of the frankness and explicitness, for, as regards ecclesiastical questions, he has no new professions to make. He had supported Lord Althorp's proposed substitute for church-rates and Lord John Russell's Dissenters Marriage Bill. He had opposed the admission of Dissenters to the Universities, with some qualiaieations as to law and medicine. He had opposed the alienation, but not the re-distribution of ecclesiastical revenues, and had already expressed himself in favour of the commutation of Tithes. He had resisted a retrospective inquiry Into the pension list, but had voted for Lord Althorp'a prospective restrictions. As Minister of the Crown he should persist in the same coti-, retaining that position, however, only from " ttrong irmpulse of public duty, the consciousness of upright motives," and the firm helief that, Ms the choice of the King, he and his colleagues would obtain a fair trial.
On what grounds he hoped to "secure" the confidence of the country when he "held no language and expressed no opinions In this address which he had not previously held while acting in opposition to the Government," and how far, if such was the case, he could take credit at this moment for "a frank
ana explicit declaration of principle," is not unequivocally clear. Such a declaration might fairly be taken to imply some novel announcement, yet novelty there was none, wbile the benefit of its semblance wa claimed by the in$enious writer. The point is not material; it is msignificant even in comparison with the questions raised by the one paragraph of the address to which we have ponted, and which contains his version of his past history. of this paragraph, which we subjoin, 'we contend that it is substantiay untrue -
NoW, I say t once that I will not accept power on the condition of daring myself an apostate from the prin ciples on which I have heretofore aCtee Atho e s nme, I never vilaamit~ that I have been, either beforo or after the, Refor Bill, the defender of abases or the enemy of

lNevur the defender of abuses nor the enemy of .h1diciovs reforms ! Then Gatton, Sarum, &c., were no abuses, and the Reform BiQ was injudicious,was, in short, an abuse in itself, though in his address he accepts it as final, and is villing to act in its spirit, mdeed, as he himself stated a few months later, at the Merchant Taylora' dinner of May 11, 1835, " not niggardly, not merely as content with a cold assent and submission to its details, but -with an honest and generous deference to its spirit and to the authority which it established." Yet only in regarding it at this date with very different feelings could he venture on the assertion contained in his address, still less could his former conduct be justified. Unless it had been hazardously injudicious in his eyes, what becomes of his former vehement opposition, and what is the meaning of his present statement? Unless, on the other hand, it had proved tolerably judicious, how was he justified in his adoption of its spirit now, and his honest deference a few months later? In any event there is a screw loose, a position unexplained, a doubt and a difficulty left to the reader. But the untruthfulness of the paragraph is more conspicuous in its reference to the amendment of the criminal law. In this respect he had been at least "disposed to acquiesce in acknowledged evils," if not to defend them. As far back as the term of his Secretaryship for Ireland Romilly was assiduous session after session in arousing the attention of the House to evils inwhichPeel then acquiescedwithout a murmur. As it has been truly said, "he never helped the cause of Law Reform vhen it was weak and needed help,-he never had a strong true word to say for it during the years when it was struggling in Romilly's hands against adverse lawyer majorities."+ Some years later, when Macintosh -%as urging the House of Commons to revise its Criminal Code, and while that code was stil hanging hosts of people for offences now punished with three months' imprisonment,t Mr. Peel and the Government were the strongest opponents of Sir James. In 1822 Mr. Peel declared the system of this country to be " the most perfect system of jurisprudence in the world." In 1823 the criminal law was "not," indeed, "perfect," and there were clauses in the statute-book which might possibly be altered for the better; but not till after the Government had been beaten in that year on this very question by a majority of 117 to 301 did Peers acquiescence subside under premsure, and not till 1826-27 did he introduce those Bills for which he then claimed credit, as " having done more towards the great anid important object of improving and consolidating the cruninal statutes of thia country than any other individual who has gone before me." The names of Romilly and Macintosh might have occurred to him then, and 14 or 15 years of previous acquiescence in evils since aclnowledged by himself might have checked this assertion in his Tamworth manifesto. Yet this is not the -whole misstatement of his personal history.
The word " apostate" is an obvious reference to the charges made against his Irish policy, and had he never been the "defender of abuses" here? In the final surrender of Catholic Emancipation we are apt to observe with too little attention the protracted defence of Protestant ascendancy. Yet who but he for some 15 years of his public life was its chief pillar and its most efficient bulwark? In 1812 he declined to pledge himself with regard to the Catholic question, but in 1813 he pledged himself unreservedly in " protesting against the principle" of Mr. Grattan's Relief Bill. From then to some still undetermined date prior to 1829 he persisted in a course the consequence of which, according to his admission of the 5th of March, 1829, was the enormous scandal that during the interval " Ireland had hardly been governed for a single year by the ordinary laws of the realm." He had himself been Secretary for Ireland from 1812 to 1818, and the character of his administration is conspicuous onthe pages of the StatuteBook. Besides its encouragementato the brood of vile informers, it was a rule of the bayonet, the dungeon, and the transpzort ship. Its chief archives are the Arms Bills, the Police l'ills, and the Ins,urrection Acts, which empowered the Irish magiatracy almost at their discretion, at all events without trial by jury, to transport any one 'who 'was found out of his dwelling-house one hour before sunrise, or one hour after sunset. This cruel and coercive system he had pushed to its utmost limits. This abuse, if ever there was an abuse, he defended as long as the means of defending it existed, and he yielded emancipation when he could hold it back no longer. His conduct in conceding it is not now in question, but his previous conduct must not be forgotten here in connexion with the assertion, now solemnly adopted as the final record of his publie conduct, that he never would admit that he had been the defender of abuses.
It is this very weakness of " never admitting," this timid recoil from unwelcome facts, which it behoves us to guard against in reading these Memoirs. Sir Robert Peel had neither the courage nor the candour to admit the changes of his opinions, the contradictions in his conduct. It was a characteristic of his which no one can contest, however variously they may judge of his integrity. It was injurious to his reputation, and it may have been fatal to his peace, that he was always endeavouriqo, before the world to reconcile two opposite lines of action. God knows whether he was entirely selfdeceived, but if so, the deception was so extraordinary that it may almost rank with the delusions of an unhealthy mind. But the fact was this, that he incessantly deferred to the "force of public opinion," the "force of existing eircumstances," the "highly artificial and complicated state of society In which we live in a country like this," and at the same time wanted to claim credit for the consistency of the man whio adopts certain abstract principles, and wisely or foolishly abides by their consequences. The former rule of conduct may be a principle of itself, and may fairly reconcile the conduct of a Minister to the requirements, of a eociety which is master of its own destinies. It may have a high though indefinite sanction in public morality, and it may be a reasonable though a precarious and hazardous Mentor. It may even be a safe guide where it is possible to keep it free from the suggestions of self-interest or of a defective judgment. But this principle, which was Peers invariable pole-star, he followed with his eyes shaded, w,ith his lips sealed, with a seeming trust in his timid heart that he was taking a different direction or that he was moving to his destined goal from superior inducements. It was thus that he falsified his position incessantly, and, whatever opinion we may hold of his personal sincerity, it was thus, as regards this paragraph in his address, that so far he assumed the government of his country npon false pretences.
It is not our intention to travel out of these Memoirs for a history of this Government and its comparative failure. According to the party predilections of its critics it will be variously regarded, but no one wil deny that Peel hlmself showed rea ability and energy in dealing with an adverse House of Commons, or that in his adroit struggles against inevitable defeat he laid the foundation of his subsequent return to power. He himself confines his statement to an explanation of his endeavours to reconcile Lord Harrowby and the Bishops of Exeter and Durham to the proposed appointment of an Ecclesiastical Commission1 and to a statement of the circumstances under which he retired upon the motion of Lord John Russell.
ti"Among the me-asme which received my ealest atten. {ion the moment that the was the appointment of the EcclesatclCm ssn,frheppose of instituting those nureadetrignoths
deliberations which were tIencsaypeiiaisto an effectual reform of such abue nthcurhestablishmaent a most urgently required extirpation, and to a supply of the maost grievous deficiencies i the ministration of relli gious rites and worship. My object and intentions in esat. jishingthis commtsion are detailed in the accompamying letter to LordHarrowby, pressing him to betome a member of the Ecclesiastical Commiion. I purposely formed the commission of persons decidedly friendly to the establishmeat ; I Durposey excluded from the commission every person wfio was not regarded as a friend to the Churcb, placing upon the commnission a large proportion (as compared wit, the lay members) of the highest spiritual antborities. I did this for the purpose of propitiating towa*ies theointended reform of the Church the goodwill and confidence of the Church itsolf. I clearly foresaw the neoessty of this, fearing that 'when reform-though it bad been loudly demandLed by rainy attached memnbers of the Church -though the necessity and the practicability of it bad been enforced by high clerical authorities (Dr. Butn for instance, the Professor of Divinty at Oxford)-fearing that when reform should assume a definite shape, and be acomnpsalmo by these suggestionis of practical imiprovement which affect the interests and expectations, of individuals, and, are the real test of the earnestness and sincerity of advocates of reform, it would be much less popular and palateable than

whben it had been dimly seen at a distance, and was merely a convenient topic for the safe display of liberal opinions ad professions.
I fully expected that the firt result of a sincere and united endeavour on tho part of the executive Govermment and the Church to work out practical improvement would be general satisfaction anud confidence among all reasonable nen, and the abatement of extravagant demands in favour either of violent change or of the niorous maintenance of the existing law and practice iu eccleslastical matters. I much feared that the second result would be a prevailing and dangerous imprension that, in consequence of this trantmilliged state of the pablc mind, in consequence of having tE'us appeased the angry clamour for innovation by the promise of improvement, the necessity for any change whatever bad passed away, and that the Church might safely be left uninolested. X was desirous, therefore, to take every security that the constitution of the commission could afford against the suspicion of an unfriendly spirit, and against the consequences of alarm, real or pretended, as to the intentions and objects of those to whom the imncortant duties of the commission were to be intrusted. I did all that I could by prvate corespondence to reconcile to the appointment and to the probable recommendations of the commission those sincere friends of the Church who were most adverse to any innovation, and whose opiuis had the greatest weight, from the purity of their lives and disinterestedness of their conduct, and from their high professional character and attainments. I refer particularly to my correspondence with my lamnented friend Dr. Vxn zMildert, the Bishop of Durham, and others. The objects contemplated by the appointment of the commissionx are set forth in the letters which I wrote to Lord Harwby, to the Bishop of Exeter,
and otherd."
It will be seen that he has no defence to offer against any Ehortcomings which may have been attributed to this Commission in consequence of the constitution which he designed for it. It is sufficient for him that its II large proportion of the highest spiritual authorities" propitiated at the ti.me the goodwill and confidenoe of Churchmen, and, if objections have been made by Churchmen subsequently in consequence of the preponderance of its episcopal members and its alleged tenderness for episcopal interests, to these objections he does not reply in justificahon either of his foresight or his predilections. There is, at all events, no ground for impeaching his consistency here. At the same time, there is no new light thrown on the policy of his Government of 18341i. There is nothing here revealed. which the public did not already know in substance, so that, with regard to this particular portion of his Memoirs, we are at a lOss to account for his personal wishes or to see the reasons for its posthumous publication.

Ballast Burning At Holloway.
BALLAST BURNIL2G AT HOLLOWIAY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I have no doubt that your correspondent "3 J P.,
is quite correct in stating that " great consternation" has aisen among ballast-burners and their congeners by the recent decosinon of thoe magistate at Clerkenlwel, who in-
caused by his ballast fires at Holloway. But this is the only point on which I can agree with J. P.," who if, as his nitfals would seem to imply, in the commission of the pece
is sadly in want of the necessary judicial qualifications for his office, since his letter to you, as it respects the facts of the case decided at Clerkenwell, is a tissue of misrepresentations.
It was at my instance that the parochial authorities of Islington interfered with the operation of " J. P's." afficted friend, and I applied to them because, being an "immediate resident" in the neighbourhood of his stifling ballast heap,I and my household were half poisoned by it. I flatly deny that, as alleged by " J. P.," any "1immed-Ate residentsofferedtoprove thatthey suffered no inconvenience from it." I gave evidence in and was present at the whole hearing of the case, and I distinctly affirm that no such offer was made, and a gentleman, also an " immediate resident," who attended and gave evidence in corroboration of mn
ownf as to the suffocating abomination of the nuisance, will confirm this statement. But this is not the only 'tuggestio falsi" of which "J. P.' has been guiltv in his attempt to excite publio sympathy in favour of his client. For the purpose of making It appear that the " offence" in this case could not possibly be so " rank" as to justify the infliction of a penalty and the magisterial veto annexed to it he caDs the ballast heap "a smiall quantity of clay," which "small quantity o clay" was simply an enormous mound of burning earth wvithin 40 yards of my garden wfall at Manor-road, holloway, estimated by the Inspector of Nuisances in his evidence to contain abont 600 cartloada at the time he surveyed it, but considerably augmented since that period. So much for the truth andhonestyof "J P.'B" statements as to matters of fact.
The only evidence adduced in defence of "J. P.,s" proeg6 was tendered by three witnesses, who in the course of their examination modestly confessed that they were ballast burners themselves. Theee were scarcely likely to ralse the cry of " stinking fish" against their neighbour, and I have no doubt that the worthy magistrate took the testimony of these disinterested gentlemen exacly for what it is worth.
I am not going to ursue " J. P." much further. I have no reason to regret is zeal in the cause of his mulctedfriend having precipitated him Into print, since the publio wililearn therefrom that this pestilential nuisance of ballast burrdng maybe stopped by a very cheap and summary proces-viz., by application to a magistrate through the vestry, under the Metropolis Local -Management Act. But " J. P." groans over the effect the magistraWs decision in the late case is likely to have on an " exigency" which it is certainly news to me to learn exists-vi;, the want of house accommodation in and about London. Indeed I thought that of all trades ix the metropebs that of building was the most overdone. If not, what mean the miles of unfinished and unoccupied houses at Notting-hill and elsewhere-what the dismal fact of builders tumbling into the Gaere by twos and threes every week-what the monster meetings of unemployed b I "" era at Smithfield? These are questions which "J. P."ill find it hard to answer consistently with his assertion that we are pinched for house roomi; buteven if it were the fact that we want more houses bult it does not legitimately follow that speculative builders should have the privilege of establishing a smothering nuisance of smoke and stench, Sundays included (when, indeed, theirlabourers seem busiest), in the midst of a populous neighbourhood like the "uninhabited" regionwhich was the scene of the recent exploits of the enterprising gentleman who was so properly fined the other day.

The River Thames.
THE ArVER TBAArBS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS.
Sir,-Iu your impression of yesterday you refer to a report, dated the 25th of January last, which appears in a blue-book just published as having been made to the First Commissioner of Works by Commander Burstal, R.N., on the state of the River Thames between Putney and Rotherhithe, giving the alteration in the low-water surface of the Thames above London-bridge consequent on the removal of the old bridge in 1832 - also stating that the ebb stream is so strong in the Pood ss to cause ' a small and saDicient scour." Now, without deciding whether the commander's statements in the above respects are perfectly accurate or not, it seems but right to those vho have preceded him in their inquiries on this subject to notice that he advances nothing new as regards this alteration in the low-water surface of the river, the fact having been often before mentioned by others; it is, indeed, alluded to in a letter which I published last year in one of your dasy con. tempor:ries, now also given in my pamphlet on the Dranage of the Metropolis, and which was, In fact, addressed to the shippisg interest. My obserntion waa ths,-that, i reference to the change in the low-water level of the river, " the removal of the old London. bridge in 1832 was not favourable to the shpping above bridge owing to the water running off quiicker and to a lower level by 4 or 5 feet than it did before." I also in the same letter went at considerable length into the river inauencc4, in operation both as regards the mcur in the river and the shitig accumulations of silt below bridge, coneiving that these influenes tend to produce effects which do not appear to me to have been hithetto sufficiently considereod and whioh, if real, axe allImportant-so long as the river is the receptacle either wholly or in part of the sewage-as regards the healthy drainage of the metroplis. Be this, however, as it may,
your :o rvations would seem to assign to the report in quee3on a merit to which the writer probably never meant to lay claim, and which, if he did, would hardly be fair. You will therefore, perhaps, favour me with a corner for the above in your neAt and

Mr. Long, in stating that one drpof the solution (maeaning fixing solution) recommended by the formula contains only 1-720th part of a grain, appenrs to have overlooked a par. ticulor reference mnade by "A.

Mr. Sleigh prosecuted, and Mr. Laxton defended.
It appeared that the prisoner Creasy was in the employment of Messrs.

(Bfore Mr. PRENDERGAST, Q.C.)
David Davis, 21, labourer, and Owen Macarthy, 24, plasterer, were indicted for feloniously assaulting Thomas Birch with intent to rob him.
Mr. Scoble prosecuted.
The prosecutor, who is captain of the sloop Cmnife, stated that upon the evening of the 12th of March he was in Greenwich, where he met a woman whom he accompanied to her lodgings. He had not been long there when he sent her out to get something to drink As soon as she was gone the prisoner Davis and another man, and Macarthy, came into the room, and Macarthy said the place was his. Witness then missed his watch, which one of the men produced from the bed, and said he had dropped it there. Having got his watch he gave them something to drink, and said he should leave, which they did not object to, but offered to show him the way; as he went out he passed the woman, who was waiting upon the doorstep. The men asked him where he wantedto go to, anahavngtold them "to theHos. pital, they agreed to showhim. He had, however, t ut very lile way from the house when he receive;a violent blow upon the back of his head, which caused him to stagger. At that moment Davis caught him by 'he hand, and said "Hl Eloa, what's the matter P" and at that moment he felt a snatch made at his wateh, but which they faiig to get ran offL The blow, an extremely violent one, had be made with some sharp-edged instrmment, and, strange to Esay although the prosecutor's hat was not cut thronu,gh, he had a wound upon the back part of the head above an inch in length, and as deep as the part would admit of without fracturing the bone.
Polce-constable 373, R, said that hearing the cries of Murder" he ran to the spot, and turning on his lantern saw the prosecutor, who seemed very faint and excited, bleeding very freely from a wound at the back of his head. At the same time another constable came up with Davis in his custody, and the prisoner was at once recognized by the prosecutor. They then went to Tranter's-buildings, Rosestreet, Greenwich, wherethey found Macarthy, who lives with the woman theprosecutor had been in the company of. Hewas in bed, but prosecutorat once recognized him, but the third man whom the police took could not be identified, and was discharged by the magistrate. The prisoners had taken prosecutor, under pretence of showing him the way, into one of the darkest and lowest parts of Greenwich before they made the aLttack. P fGrewo

Mr. Thompson prosecuted, and rlr. Philips defended.
The proseectrix, a woma of the town, who was brought up in custody from Horsemonger-lane-gaol, said, that upon
e 27th of MArch she left home with 16 sovereigns and some silver in her possession, and went toa dgt tghouse kejpt by a womaan named Evans, where she met the prisoner rowderhill, who asked her if she would give him some money, as he was just out of prison and had no moneu
to pay his lodging. She gave him a trifle, and then tok him and a woman with whom he cohabited to a coffeehouse and gave them something to eat. After this they went about during the nirght from house to house drinking. During the -nIat they met Leary, whom Powderhili told to come with them and about 5 dclock the next morning they all went to a pu;lichoume in the Borough, prosecutrix treating. She then asked the barmn if he would take care of her money for her, and took it from her bosom, where she had it tied up in her handkerchief, to give it to him. She hdnosoonerdone so than Powderhill seized her by the hand, which he severely ixjsred in forcing the parcel from her. At the same time Leary seized her by the throat, and they both threw her with great violence to the ground, 'Where Leary held her While Powderhill got away. She managed to ciing to Leary, who dragged her after him into the street, where a police-constable took him into custody.
In cross-examination proseeutrix said that she was now in gaol because she could not find securities to appear at this court. She refused to say how she became possessed of the money she had been charged with stealing, but the man who had lost his money could not identify her as the thief. Aecaptain used to allow her 1t. a-week for some years She
had been convicted of robbery. I
Police-constable Lavenden, who took Lear to the station, said that on their way there he eaid to the prosecutrix,
Don't come up, and rD find Jesse," meaning Powderhill, and he will turn us up six quid" (sovereigns). About two hounrs afterwards witness sawl Powderbi runing away from a brother constable, and upon his being capturedhe called out to a woman whom he lived with t go to prosecutrix with three sovereigns, using the same slang term that Leary had, or he would get transported.
Mr. Pa.UAMPS, for the defence, argued upon the fact of their all being out drinkdmg, and put it to the jury whether, upon the testimony of such a woman as the prosecutrix, they blieved that she had the money, and, if so, whether
sh ha not herself stolen It.
The Coisa90sEro told the jury t-hat, ;without evidence to the contrary, whatever the characer of the prosecutrix, the money must he held to be hers.
The jury found the prisoners Gudiy, and they were each sentenced to slx monhs~ Amprisonment.
Louis Napoleon La Gras, a respectable-looking Frenchman, who been out upon his own recognsances, surrendered to take his trial for having, before ohn Hammil,
the magistrate, made a false declaration. M.hil}ips prosecuted.
The evidence, which was extremely complicated, proved the facts out of which the charge arose to be these. Tha, prosecutor to the indictment is hir. Defries, the inventor of the dry gasmeters, and the defendant claims to be the in. ventor ot something for facilitating the manufacture of a
art of r. Defries's invention known as the diaphram EL tfimetoawards the close of haSt year he enteredMr Defries's service to make these things at so much each, but previosly to beginnig them defendant had to makle certain tools, for which he required a press and screw, for the purchase of which x. .Defries advanP¢ed1himStIg. The press and the screw were to remain at the prosecutor's, and the defendant, when he began his regular work, was to repav prosecutor for this and other tools, which would then be his own. Prosecutor also advanced the defendant 5o. for his support, which was to be similarly repaid. Early in January the screw was missed, and defendant did not deny having taken it and pawned it in Bath-street, Citv-
d . Defendant did not return to his work, and on the 6th of March he came to some arrngement wnth the pro. aecutor, who pve him M., upon which he (defendant) reluctantly gave up the duplicate of the screw, which had been pledged for 14. Upon the next day he obtained a declaration of the usual character, which was taken before the magistrate, Mr. Haminill, at Worship-street, and the defendant, when asking for the declaration, did not say wthat he had done with the duplicate, but merely said he had not got it. It further appeared that in Febrularythe defendant took out a summons for wages at the farylehone Police Court, wrhence he was referred to the County Court., and upon the 6th of March he summoned Mir.

the es containing them to take to the docks. Instead of taking them there for shipment, they were conveyed elsewhere, and the contents were abstracted frm them, cinders and dust being substituted in their place. The fraud was not discovered till the arrival of the boxes in Melbourne, when thoy were opened by the porson to whom they had been eonsigned.
T homas Hayton, constable No. 588.-I took the prisoners into custody yestrday in consequenoe of information that rachedme mreecting a robbery of the prosecutor's property in March, I85
Mr. F. Fuller, a packer in the service of the prosecutor, said, in the months of February, March, and June of last year large quantities of boots and shoes were packed in cues and trunks at Mr. Isenbures premises for the purpose of being forwarded to Melbourne. The cases and trunks were then delivered to the prisoner Maybery, -who was directed to take them to the docks for shipment.
John Morris the prosecutor's foreman, and John Nicholson, who was lormerlyin the same employment, also proved that large quantities of hoots and shoes had boen packed in cases and delivered to Maybery, whose duty it was to convey them to the docks.
J. Hatfieid, foreman at St. K6tharinoDocks, produced his books, which contained entries of the receipt of the boxes. (Upon comparing dates it appeared that some of the boxes did not reach the docks on the same day that they left the prosecutor's premises, which they ought-to have done in the due course of busimess.)
Maria lItooney.-The prisoner Pickering lodged at my house last year. His wife told me thxt he worked in the docks for a living. I remember upon several occasions seeing him go out with a lar bag filled with boots which he put into a cart, and then drove off with tbem.
Timothy Desmond.-I am a tinplate worker and reside at 85, Chamber-street, Goodman's-fields. I know all theprisoners. They were in the habit of associating toether Maybery Is a carman, About nine monthsao I helped them to remove one lot of goods. I had prevlousl7 met Boyce in Whitechapel, and he told me that a quantity of boots and shoes was to be bought at a oertalnplace I-went with him to the top of Upper Rupert-street, Commercial
road. I there saw Maybery and Collins in a publichouse. Pickering was not present upon that occasion. Boyce purchased boots of Maybery and CoUllns I do not know what he paid for them, but I saw a check for 401. upon one occason which Boyce asked me to get cash for. I had knonv
!Boyce and Pickering in another transaction, which I believe will be the subject of a separate prosecution. A large quantity of boots was in the court to which I have referred, and after we ad taken them away a man named Dennis M'Carthy helped us to take away another lot.
Anofcero the metroolitan police force here stepped forward and, addreing the magistrate, said that having seen M6arthy, whom; he knew to be implicated in the robbery, in cort listening to the proceedina he had taken him into custody, and locked him up in a ce4 below.
Mr. Alderman HAcL..-Place him by the side of the other prisoners at once.
Dennis 3Carthy was immediawtely placed in the dock with the four prisoners already under examination, and Mr. Goodman, the chief clerk, read to him the evidence of Dos. mond as far as it had been given.
Examination continued.-I know M'Carthy, who was an associate of the other four prisoners. He was present at the time of the delivery of the boots and shoes. I cannot swear who bronut out the baMs. M'Carthy helped to bring the goods into the court. Iafterwrards saw him put rubbish into the boxes, all the other prisoners, except Pickering, being present when that s done
Cross-examined by Mr. Stedman, for Boyce.-I have been out of work for the last eight weeks. Before that time I worked in Camomile-street, I left thAt situation becAuse they were slack. Previous to that I worked for Messrs. Moses, on Tower-hill, for nearly 13 years. I was dismissed from that situation on suspicion of being implcated in steaing some boots. Mr. Moses did not assign any reason for discharging me.
Mr. Lewi.-It is only fair to the solicitor to gay that we are going to prefer a charge agaiast two of tho prisoners and the witness for stealing those goods.
Cross-examination continued.- beoieve I was discharged because a lot of goods belon g to my master was found in my cellar. I do not live alone, but cohabit with the prisoner Boyce's sister. Boyce has never remonstrated with meforlivinginastate of adultery with his sister. I did not ask him for some money last Friday. I did not tell him. that unless he gave me 191 I would " split" upon him. He owed me some money. I found out he had robbed me, and I asked him whether he was going to pay me and he said "No." He owed me money, my share of the produoe of the goods that had been stolen from Messrs. Moses. I gave information of Mr. Isenburg's robbery to the officer Hayton. I did not give information against M'Cartby, although I knew he vwas implcated, because he has a large family.
Cross-examined b Pickering.-I sent for you on Friday night, and told you had been given to understand that you and Boyce had robbed me. I asked you if you intended to pay me the money you owed me, You sad " No," and laughed at me.
Cross-examined by M'Carthy,-I have been charged at this coutt several times. I once bought a telescope of tho constable Hayton. I have bought several other things of him also. I once asked him to buy a snuffbox of me for 11. 5s., and he offered me 11. 2s. 6d. for it. I bought the snuffbox of you.
M'Carthy.-Yes; and I stole it. (Laughter.) To the Magistrate.-The witness admitsghe bought a telescope of the constable, and it will require a pretty good telescope, my Lord to enable anybody to see through this case thoroughly. (Much laughter). This constable has got a celebrated out-and-out terrier, which he warrants to Idll more rats in a given time thati any other dog of the same weight in the kingdom; and he has been in the constant habit of taking the witness Desmond with him to dog-fights, and other fancy things. This case has been got up between the constable and Desmond.
Upon re-examination by Mr. Lewis, Desmond said,-151. was daue to me as my share of the produce of the goods stolen from Messrs. Moses. Boyce and Pickering were in partnership, and they bought the goods of me, and never paid me for them.
'the prisoners, upon the application of Mr. Lewis, were then remanded.
Bow-msTng-r.-Willfam Stevens Hayward, who stood remanded (on bail) from that day week on a charge of rape, appeared before MIr. JARDn in discharge of his rocogmzances, hut as the prosecutrix, Jane Bettison, wa s not in attendance, and no communication had been received which could account for her absence,
Mr. J.ARDnWZsaid hehad no choice but to dismiss the
*The prisoner was accordingly disc-harged.
MAXUMROUGEU-STRsr.-Lientenant Ernest Lloyd was brought up for final examination, charged with obtaining goods from a number of tradesmen by fraudulent pretenoes.
Mr. Eoberts, bootmaker, Bond-street, from whom the prisoner had obtained three pairs of boots and given a chock on Cox and Co., which was dishonoured, was cres. examined, but he did not alter his proviou tesmony which was that he should not have parted with the last two pairs of boots had he not received a check which he bdievod =would have been honoured.
A gentleman from Cox and Co. said he refused payment of the cheek, and had it beea presntea ny time during the last three months It woald not have been paid.
Cross-examined.-The prisoner, as an artillery officer, necessarily had an accountopen with the firm. The pri. soner went with his regiment to Sebastopol. His father, Colonel Lloyd. died at ScutarL Bankers under certin circumstances would pay checks where n account was overdrawn, but under paticular circtancee, such a those In which the prisonerwplaced,payment would be refused Never heard until Monday last that the prisoner wa in ex pectation of selling a reversionary latere6t on some property and payigthe amountintohishouse.

After. wards the prisoner caUed and a3ked him to cash a check for 5. which he did. The next evening the prisoner again called, and asked him to make the 51 check 101. HRtold the prisoner he had only three sovereigns about him. The prisoner took the money and gave a check for t. The check was dishonoured.
Mr. Worsley inquired if there were any further cases to 'be brouaght forward, and whether the magistrate considered tbat the evidence of false pretee was suilliciently complete in alithe cases
Mr. BEaDox said there was this amount of evidence, that tbe prisoner had given checks after his pay had becn stopped in December, and when ho knew there was no money to meet themr.
The prisoner wished to contradict a statement which ho said had appeared in the public papers, that ho had embezzled the public money.
Mr. B.Amol said no such statement had been made before him.
Several tradcemen here intimated that thoy had chargee against the prisoner.
Mr. BEADON replied, there were at least 30 charges gSt the prisoner. It would be useless to take them all as the caes already heard were sufficiently complete.
Our feporter atates that Lieutenant Lloyd was mistaken in sa,ing that he was charged in the public papers with embezzlng public money,

Mr. Sleigh, barrister, conducted the prosecution on behalf of the Associate Institute for the Protcotion of Women and in his opening address stated that according to his inEtructions a more atrocious case of abduction and rape was never brought before a court of justice. Re then wentirto a brief statemnent of the facts, as afterwards proved in evi-
dence, and dwelt with much 'feelg upon the pain, anxiety, and anguish experienced by the parents of the girl at the calamity brought upon her by the heartless and infamous conduct of the prisoners

Gd. for the poor-box from " J. 6." An acknowledgment in Th7e nmcs was requested.
MIr. Szrs, in mentloning the case of the young woman Floyd, said it was the most pitiable one he had ever heard. She had lost her husband seven montbs after she was married to him, and her mother, sister, and brother a few weeks afterwards; the poor creature was destitute,
and owing to her weakly condition from the effect of typAus fever and her recent conlinement, was unable to do anything for her maintenance. Ee had given her 10s, from the poor-box because it was a meet deservig case.
SouTuwAB.w-Edward John Syer, a person employod by Sir Charles Napier's election comnittee,.was summoned before Mr. ComBi by William Wise, cab driver, No. 2,134, for refusing to pay him 16s. for the hire of his vehicle on the day of election, the complainant being engaged to carry the voters to the poing booth.
The complainant said he was engaged by the defendant to carry the voters on the 30th ult., the day of the Southlwark election. He had sinoe applied for payment, and being unable to get his money, he was compeUed to take the present prcdtings.
DeSfed'ant.-'Iadmit employing the complainant. On the 28th uit. I engaged 30 cabs for Sir Charles Napier-25 at Ils. the day, and5 at 16s. The complainant was one of the latter. I received my orders through Mr. James, Sir Charles Napier's committee agent. I have those orders in writing, xna was authorized by the committee.
Mr. COMIi.-Then you must pay the complainant, and look to the committee.
Defendant.-But I was then appointed superintendent of cabs for the election, and surely I am not answerable.
Mr. Commyx-You must pay, whether superintendent or not. You were the onlyperson who hired the complainant
If you had told him to go to the committee, as tb-y were in want of cabs, and if they had hired him, they would have been answerable, but you hired him and must
DYefendant.-Hrow shall I act with Sir Charles Napier under the circuntauceel
Mr. CosraL-Go and swe him about it. Defendant.-That would be of no use.
Mr. CoMsE-That's another thing. Who is Sir Charles's agent?
Defendant.-Mr. James, of Croydon, and Mr. Vtjiito acted for him. I received my orders from the committee, and the complainant should go to them, and not to me, who Am onlya poor man.
Mr. Coauss,-You must psy it and sue them. I understand you actually carried the voters to the poll, and surely, as that is the caem, they wil pay for that. Sir Charles Napier had the advaatage of the voters, and he must pay if the demand is oorroct.
A cab proprietor in the body of the court called out, The oommittee hired 25 of my cabs, which were used in conv ing voters to the poll, and I can't got my money. It'S rascaly conduct of Sir Charles Napier and his committee, but I'l makel hmpay."
Mr. COmBL.-I am sorry to hear these complaints, and I think there must be something that has delayed the settlement of the accounts between Sir Charles and Mr. James, his agent. There might have been some greement about the pgos amount to cary him through his eaection. I dare say if you wait a little tume you will all get your money.
Byer.-It's disgraceful on his part as wel as his committee's to allow one of his servants, a poor man, to be summoned for a cab hired by their orders to carry voters to the

Mr. ComBE.-What time do you want, then, as I shall order you to pay 16g., and 5s. costs 2
Syer.-Irl pay it in a week, Sir. But what must I do ? There are nearly 30 cabmen in the same position, and I may be summoned here by alL
Mr. ComsiB.-I should recommend you to summon Sir Charles Napier in the County Court, as if you have tho orders of the committee in writing he cannot get out of it. He could not have had all those voters had it not been for the cabs, as many would not have gone to the poll had they not been carried there. At the same time I should advise you to apply to him first.
Syer.-Il do that directly, Sir; and I am much obliged to your worship for giving me time to pay th money. lql surely pay itt on Monday next and summon Sir Charles
No person appeared en the part of tho committee, but there was a number of cabmen present to hear the deCision,
STATISTICS OF CRIME.-The quarter sessions for
STATISTiCS OF Ciu?r.-The quarter sessions for the various counhes in the wost of England have just been held. Sir S. .L Northeote, as chairman of the Devon Quarter Sessions, stted in his charge to the grand jury that a docrease of crime was apparent in comparing the number of prisoners for trial at the present sessions with corresponding sessions in past years. The total number to be tried at tho Easter Sessons, 1°57, was 16, and last year thero wero 26 prisoners for trial. Th nunmber of prisoners committed to the gaol was considerably less than in the corresponding quarter. Last year there were 331 committals, and in the present quarter there were 244-showing a decrease of 87. At the Cornwall Quarter Sessions Mr. Lethbridge, the chair. man, dated in his charge to the grand jury "that thero were only 2 prisoners for triA, and last year at the corresponding perod there were o * consequently, in that resct there was a diminution. But when lt wag recollected that the. aa;izes wero just passed, and that there were 42 risons tried, whereas at the previous aizes there were 49, he was afraid crime was not diminishing in the county." At the. Dorset Quarter Sesions the Rev. IL F. Yeatman, the chairman, stated that there were 10 prisoners for trial, that 13 prisoners hd beeth tried under the Juvenile Offende
Act, 32 prisoners under the Suammay Jurisdiction Act, and 2Sat the assizcs, makdng&atotal of ~.Under these 'vln stances the chairma-n said he could not congratulate the jr on a diminution of crimne throughout thecony Ter wag, however, a decae in the number of s

DRIURY.LANE
By tho genorAity of playgoers, even including some of the youlngo`Ac, Easter AMonday wiUl be remembered as a theatrical 'iestival scarcely inferior in importance to Boxing. dayN If Cbxisttras had its pantomnies, Easter baa its brill lnmt spectacles, and the latter, though less n&Uion41, wem *Treqsaently as attractive as thelformer. But, while the 'winter festival has been raised in henour, for the nugmented
ntumber of theatres has brought with it an inretased nunmber of harlequinades, the spring holyday has for the last three or four years been in a declining co&iition, and at the p'reeent moment hazs nearly vanished 4together, as far as theatrical celebration is concerned. The playhoases of the metropolis are neady all of them open, but mny reader who takes the trouble to run over the list of programmes will t ,once perceive tUat there is nothing X distiuge-ish them from the amusements of the least festive seasons of vhe year. In ltbe eyes of a veteran playgoer the general non-observance of Easter must be absolestelyfrightful.
The modern facilities of locomotion will, of course, be cited as the ready explanation of a chauge in the customs of a whole class that, wHile it asl but obliterates the peculiarities of the spring holyday, leaves the winter -festival intact. When the weather invites people out to green fields, there is now less chance of securing a six weeks' "run' of an Easter piece than there is of earning the same amount of vitality for a Christmas pantomime, brought out at a season when in-door amusements are those most readily chosen. But we suspect there is an internal besides an external cause for the decline of Easter entertainments. The class of pieces of which they were composed has beea almost worn out by over-uEe. Those earnest melodramas and f(e'ries, which were Eeen by our fathers in simple faith, were followed by a burleEque ocnu.s of drama, which at last wholly monopolized the Easter stage, and even encroached on the precincts of Harlequin at Christmas. The excess in the article of burlesque at last led to a feeling akin to nausea. There is a nationality in harlequinade 'which survives changes of fasbion, and the temporary supremacy of burlesque has only produced a reaction in favour of pantomime. On the other hand, burlesque is an exotic which thrives through the magnificence of some particular manager, or the grotesque talent of some particular actor, and when administered in too large doses is instinctively rejected. Now it has in a great measure lost its charm; Easter is actually left withoat an attraction peculiar to itself. The old fairy melodrame is in every sense of the word passC, and pantomimes from their very nature would not be found palatable if performed during more than one season of the year. Having nothing wherewithi they can mark the Paschal festival, the practice of marking is, as a matter of necessity, abandoned by the managers.
Drury-lane was formaUy closed for the season some time before Passion Week, and its reopening last night took the theatrical world by surprise. According to all appearances no lengthened season is intended, but Mr. Charles Dillon <' stars" for a week in some of his favourite characters, and the latter portion of the entertainment consists of acompound pantomime, made up of the introduction to the Lyceum Conrad and afedaera, with the renowned " transformation scene," and the Drury-lane harlequinade See Sa7c, JAargcey Dau;.
HAYMARKET.
This theatre has not generaUy been what is termed a 'holyday house," but last night it was crowded in every nook. The agreeable phenomenon may be ascribed partly to the circumstance that this year it is the only esta. blishment in the western part of London at which Easter is celebrated by a s?ecial entertainment, but more particularly to an alteration in the prices of admission, which is now adopted for the first time. By the provisions of the leases under which the property has hitherto been held both Mr. Webster and his successor, Mr. Buck. stone, have been compeUed to maintain a tariff of prices totally different from that of any other house, and, we may add, t oteUy at variance with the 3pirit of the age. However, Mr. Buckstone, having lately renewed his lease, has beean enabled to make fresh stipulations, and the consequence is a reformed scale, by which the charge for the aristocratic stalls is increased, wlhile the right to occupy those portions of the house that are devoted to the two great masses of the public is obtainable at a cheaper rate than was ever known at the establishment. The " proof of the pudding is ia the eating," and the crowded state of the house last night demonstrated the wisdom of Mr. Buckstone in venturing on a bold innovation within the regions associated witll the name of Samuel Foote.
TheEaster pieco-theonly one properlyso-called,inLondon -is a burlesque, written by Mr. Talfourd, u'i the story of "IHippomenes andAtalanta,"and adorned with a due amount of decorative magnificeneo, comprising a final (ableani, vying in brilliancy with the " transfornation scones" of pantamime. The ancient fable is closely followed, the agile victor being somewhat mildly represented by Miss Ellen Ternan, and the agile vanquished being impersonated with a world of spirit by Miles Oliver. Miss Wilton, who during the whole of the winter season delighted everybody at the Lyceum by an exuberance of that quality which is popularly designated "smartness," made her Haymarlcet d:0a,d in the character of Cupid, anld was received with the most violent acclamations. She justifiedthe welcomebby becoming " smarter" than ever. As there may be shades of drollery even in burlesques, the author of Atalanta has enriched the fable with two broadly comic parts, as a contrast to the less violently comic hero and heroine. Tie pedagogue of Hippomenes (played by Mr. Compton) falls in love with Atalanta, and the nurse of Atalanta (played by Mrs. Poynter) falls in love with the pedagogue, and great is the diversion occasioned by the encounters between this venerable couple. Burlesque is no longer in its heyday, but a single burlesque for al London may be relisbed, especially when written by so able a punster as Mr. Taifourd, and decorated by so liberal a manager as Mr. Buckstone. We would, however, suggest a little more hastening to the principal points of the story, and the onission of certain vocal embellishments, which, in theniselves not entrancing, derived no excessive power of fascination from the manner in which they were executed.
PRINCESS'S.
When there is scarcely a manager in London who thinks it worth while to go out of his way for the celebration of Easter it could not be expected that Mr. Charles Kean, who has recently produced the most splendid historical spectacle ever witnessed on any boards, would trouble himself about burlesques or such like profane tritles. The house last niight was crowded in every part, but the crowd had nothing to do with Easter Monday. It represented the permanent attraction of Richard II., which is far beyond the influence of times and seasons.
ADEL'LPHL
The demonstration at this house did not so mueh expres' respect for the holydays as loyalty to the directress, who had not performed for some weeks. No novelty of any kind was attempted, but the popular version of Les Rifes was revived, and the reappearance of Madame Celeste, whose name is associated with all the great Adelphi successes for sosnething like adozen years, washailedwithenthusiasm. Atthistheatre, perhaps above all others, the public is strongly attached to its established favourites, and a genuine Adelphian,when he has missed a familiar face for a length of time, is anxious to see it once more. The person before him is not merely the representative of a fictitious character named ix the bills, but wears a halo composed of all the achievements of past seasons. That the directress of such an establishment should hold a sort of feudal chieftainship over the sympathies of her audience is almost amatter of course, and hence the demonstration last night may fairly be termed loyal.
OLYMPIC.
Here there is no novelty to mark the holsday period, but the fine acting of Mr. Robson as the miser in Daddy Hardac,- remains the chief attraction. Although Mr. Robson amuses his audience in every character that he assumes, it is only now and then that he has a part in which he can really exhibit the extent of his genius. His mission is not to follow in the track of ordinary low comedians, but to depict extraordinary idiosyncrasies, and this mission is fully performed in his delineation of the rustie Harpagon, built by
lramatista upon the Grandet of De Balzac.
SADLE4R' WELLS.
The first Pieee Presented to a holyday audience was someWhat lugubrious viz, use Deezk of Eva. It is based on An incident drawn from the famtous tale of Uncde Tone, CaUia. The Howard family appear in the principal characters, the Part of the ceaphic Eva being sustained by OordehLa fow*od, a child of about seven years of age, and that of r oepy bY her mother. Sligt and unsubstantial in its texture, with incidents very gloomy and depressing in their character (including two 4cath-sceens), and a dialogue drearily maorbid and lackadaisical in its sentiment, the piece was neverthelesa heard wi±h exemplary patience by the audience, and at its close the chief actors were called before the curtain to re-
eeive its tribute of Applause. The histionic skisl displayed by little Miss Howard is amazing for a Aild of her tender years; and her succems in em'oodying Mrs. Stowo's etherial and somew%at shadowy creation approaches s near a possible to perfection. The wild, whimaieal, axd untraotable Topy was also Admirably delineated by Mrs. Howard, wbile the tbingled afectatioon and selishnefs of that

Mr. Buckstono', comic drama of Good ibr Nothing f£dl towed, and the transition from its too " erious " predecessor afforded a grateful seuse of relief. Here, indeed, the audience had Topsy reproduced, bat a Topsy of a Europaan type. The madcap Nan was rendeced by Miss Woolgar, vhose consummate acting cannot be too highly eulogized. The slatternly, riotous, and unmanageable orphan girL whose two over-indulgent guardians have spoilt her by their opposite tempers and their conaicting views of discipline, is soon seen to have much native goodness aboat her, though it be sadly overlaid by a repulsive exterior and a wild untanmeableness. The first to detect her good points is Charley (Mr. C. Seyton), her sweetheart, who believes that somethbig may be made of her, while every one else despairs of her reforma. tion-thus inverting the proverb that " love is blind." Her womanly pride and her natural generosity being simnulta neously appealed to, her latent virtues at length come to light, and the magnaninity she displays when her best friends are in diffioulties exemplifie3 the inapplicability of the title of the piece, by disproving that she is really "good for nothing." Tom Dibbles, the ludicrously irascible, but soi diant inmperturbablegardener (Mr.J. Chester),andHarry Collier, the bluff yet self-restrained railway-fireman (Mr. Lingham), were admirably delineated, their bickerings as to the best mode of rearing their interesting proMyee repeatedly convulsing the house With laughter.
'he srand fairy extravaganza of the "Fair One with the Golden Looks" next succeeded. This production, from the pen of Mr. Planche, isfounded on the popular nursery tale by the Counte3s D'Anoir, and was originally performed at the H%aymarket. The soenery is brilliant, the incidents striking, and the dialogue pointed and telling. Mr. Chester's barlesques, as King Lachrymoso, of some of Shakspeare's finest soliloquies, and particularly of the dagger scene in Macbeth-a corkscrew being substituted for the implement of death-were irresistibly comic, and drew down rapturous plaudits from all parts of the house. Miss Clara St. Casso made an excellent Queen Lucidora; and the spirited acting of Miss E, Jacobs, as Graceful, contributed greatly to the success of the piece. The entertainments concluded at a late hour with the romantic drama of the Jco of L,ubed-
The attendance was pretty numerous.
THE STRAND THEATRE.
At this house was produced a now burlesque extravaganza by Mr. Leicester Buckingham entitled Villiam Tel. This was preceded by a domestic drama in three acts caled 1?dsA OacVcy, which narrated the sufferings and repentance of a blacksmith's wife seduced by a lord, and was, after the manner of too many of such dramas, long, tedious, and uninteresting. The burlesque was of course founded upon the story of the Swiss patriot and archer, and so far as it proceeded followed pretty closely the accepted accounts of that distinguished artiat's career. We say so far asitpro ceeded, because, as we shall in due course have to relate, the conclusion of the story was reserved for another evening. The piece, although much too long, consistinig as it does of no less than ten by no means short scenes, lasting about two hours and a-half, is written with a good deal of spirit, atd contains some tolerably smarb hits at popular foibles and popular grievances-such as the doings of " fast" young men who wear long coats aud all-round collars, and who carry thin umbrellas; the want of wisdom and of wit shown by many of our legislators, the income-tax, and Sunday legislation; crinoline escapes verbal reference, but its use is satirized by the dress of one of the dramatis personm. The allusions to the failings of candidates or members of Parliament are so numerous as to dispose the auditor to imagine that the author himself must have a3pired to that position, but failed; while the references to church-rates and income-tax might natarally excite a suspicion that he was suffering from the double grievance of a proceeding in the Ecclesiastical Courts at the suit of the churchwardens, and the carrying out of the threat of "Exchequering" occasionally held over the heads of defaulting tax-payers by the Commissioners of Inland IRevenue. The passage which excited most applause was the description of the unishment which Gessler at first designed for Tell The tyrant ruler bade his attendants take "the slave," not to " the deepest dungeons 'neath the castie moat," but to Peel's coffeehouse, and there to cause hibu to read al the speeches of all the candidates on all the hustings; after which he was to be compelled to hear Mr. Spurgeon preach three sermons on a Sunday. The pece was well played, Miss Cuthbert acting the part of the hero. For the first two hours of its career it went pretty well, despite a little too much and too audible prompting, and the audience were not niggard of their laughter and applause. There were, however, several slight " hitches," and ultimately the shooting at the apple was spoiled by the too speedy appearance of the wespon in that fruit. This was a severe blow to the piece, but It still limped on to the "terrific broadsword combat," which it was announced would be followed by " universal scrimmage and general reeonciliation." This combat, which was between Wiliam Tell and Gessler (Mr. J. Clarke) was very protracted* however, at lost, the governor seemed dead, Miss Cuthbert left the stage, and the audience hoped for the conclusion. Gessler, however, revived, fought with two other persons, and was eventually left ontthe stage, sword in hand, defying all comers. At this tiune the prompter was heard in angry remonstrance with some one or more of the performers. He threatened in case something were not done to " ring down." His threat produced no effect; he did ring, and down came the ourtain. Though the audience were thus deprived of the universal scrimmage, there is every reason to believe that it lost none of its severity by being confined to the persons hehind the scenes; let us hope that the reconoiliation was as general as the play-bill announced it was to be. Theaiidience appeared surprised at tbe abrupt termitnation of the piece, and there were some calls for an explanation, butnone was offered. The entertainment concluded with a new farce, 11 yout Woutdc'nt Melntion it, and the audience did not fail to appreciate the unintentional reference of this title to the events of the evening.
SURREY.
An entire ohange of programme, the production of a now drama, and the engagement of several popular favourites in aid of the ordinarily effective company, are the attractions for the Easter holydays which the lessees of this establishment present to the public. Upon the recurrence of such festivals as the present the Surrey is sure to have its full share of patronage, and the enterprising managers who cater so liberally and so zealously for the masses have no reason to complain that their exertions go unrewarded. Last night formed no exception to the rule; the doors of the theatre were early besieged by an anxious crowd, and in a few minutes after the opening of the doors the house was filled with an eager and impetuous audience.
The performances commenced with a new drama, in two acts, under the title of The Iron A rm; or, thcc S lolc Marrlage, which bears upon the face of it the evidence of a French parentage. The plot is simple, but the events are startling, savour£ng rather too much of the atrocities of rascaldom to recommend them very strongly to a refined taste. The simple story is this:-A lackey named Simonet, who has been bred In crime and nurtured in villany, has at tlce close of the lieign of Terror ingratiated himself with the Marquis de la BrieUe, and has so successfuUy concealed his real character and position that the MIarquis has appointed him to the confidential post of private secretary, in which capacity he has gained the affections of the daughter of his patroci, and has cajoled her into a private marriage. The Mlarqulis has destined her to be the bride of her cousin the young Viscount do Richebois, and hence the necessity for thc secret marriage. A son is the offspring of the union, ad, as it is essential to the plans of Simonet that the birth of the child should also remain a secret it is committed immediately upon its entrance to the wend to the Foundling Hospital. The curtain rises in the first act upon the kites ior Of a low tavern in Paris, where a number of the members of Iron Arm's band are assembled, and as Simonet finds his way here and is at once recognized by Iron Arm, although hce is in the garb of a gentleman and passes as Gaston de Boiselle, the audience are at no loss to understand hl8 real character. Between the first nud second acts a period of three years is supposed to have elapsed, but the action of the play has only slightly advanced in the interval. The mnarriage of Therese to Simonet is still unknown to the Mfarquis, Simonet's rascalities are stiU undiscovered, and the young lady's cousin still cherishes a passion which, of course, never can be gratified. In the course of this act, however, the catastrophe rapidly approaches. Simonet is too great a villain even for Iron Arm and his gang, who, albeit notaddicted to the melting mood, absolutely shudder at his atrocities; and as, beyond this, he is by no means lavish with his gold, exposure threatens him at every turn, and it is evident that concealment cannot much longer aid him. Simonet's object is to procure the speedy death of the MarquiR, because upon that event occurring his immense wealth would be inherited by Therese. To this end he resolves upon poisoning his patron, and to preven!t unpleasant disclosuresin the meantime he
lays ak deep plan aio to poison Iron Arma, by which means he hopes to destroy all the evidences of his guilt. The
scheme which he purposes to carry into effect is detailed with great minuteness in the play, the capsule is removed from the JohaDnisberg, the cork is drawn, the prussic acid is mixed with the wine, the cork is replaced, tho bottle is resealed, and every detail is exhibited with only too muoh exactness. But one of the gang has proved a traitor to his companions, and the timely arrival of a file
of soldiers at the moment when the diabolical plot is about to be put into execution prevents its succeEsful issue; Simonet is himself compelled to drink the poisoned
/ine, and Iron Arai is shot as he is about to precipitate hmef into the Seine. The foundling child is restored to its now widowed mother, and, as allthe rascals of the piece are killed, we suppose we may say that poetical jistice is done, and that virtue is rewazded
The acting throughout was admirable, Mr. Shepherd
impting a good deal of character into the ruffian part of M S venture, th Iron Arm,while the more refined. villanies
of Simonet were portrayed with vigour and spirit by Mr.
Basil Potter. An admirable low comedy nartbiound h meet representative in Mr. Widdieomb, whoo-'odditie3 were even more droll than usual. Miss A. Mort4ner, from Birminghar, who played Ther e, proisaes to preve an acquition. She has a good stage face and fiure, and her Iimpersnation was ait once chaste anid imnlmesoned. MUss E. Johnstone, from New castle, who is ic the "Singing Chambernmsid" line, ig also an acquisition. The dframa was q uite successful, and all the leadmg personagesx were called
fefore the curtain at its close.

Mr. Widdicomb was an amusing Xidas, and Mr. Yarnold's Pan displayed considerable humour-
The performances concluded with a romantic spectacle, entitled the " Dumb Savoyard and his Monkey," in which Mr. Flexmore displayed wonderful ingenuity and 1le1dbility as the monkey, and Mademoisele Auriol sustained with equal success the part of Pepino, the Savoyard.
Entertainments so varied and plentiful must needs have something in them to suit every tste, and the Easter holydays have thus been meot suessfully inaugurated at the Surrey.
VICTORIA.
None of our great dramatic critics, so far as we are aware, have been at the pains to analyze and classify that peculiar species of composition which is called " a Victoria melodrama," and which nightly attracts
audiences over the water much more numerous and more enthusiastic than a Shakesperean revival or the last new farce from Paris have any chance of securing. This omission is greatly to be l::mented, for the subject is a wide one, and, adequately handled, would be interesting and ir,structive. There might be some difficulty in deciding whether the drama proper to the Victoria belongs to the classical or romantic school, for it possesses some of the distinctive features of each, and a close eQaminer would probably come to the conclusion that the playwrights of the New-cut are imitators neither of Sophodes nor of Shakspeare, but that they are to be classed by themselves in a Echool of their own. They have a contempt for the unities, and even for natural probabilities, which must for ever close the ranks of the classicists against them; but, at the same time, by high colouring, by sacrificing all the lighter sbades of character to the delineation of one ruling passion, and by a judicious alternation between optis.ism and pessisissi, they place before their audiences as deep-dyed miscreants, as God-like heroes, and as monstrously-used innocents as ever trod the Greek, Roman, or French stage. In a Victoria drama there are no half-and-half characters - good inlaid with bad, and bad with good - such as Mr. ThackeraY. and other modern aovelists are endeavouring to bring into fashion, but when a man has a favourite vice or virtue it completely overshadows the rest of his nature, and he seems to make the indulgence of it the chief busimess of his life. Every one of the vilains ought to have been hung at least a dozen times before the commencement of the piece. The heroes are perpetually whipping out their swords whenever there is a cbance of getting the odds of four to one against them. Virtae is of that unmitigated unbending kind which is rather boring in private life; and the comic business, which is thrown in to spice the whole, is in the broad, practical, and easily appreciable vein of Mr. Punch. When the old Greek dramatists had a bit of bloody business to do they took the feelings of their audiences into consideration, and did it behind the scenes, but the gentlemen who write for the Victoria have no such delicacy; they rather delight in visible horrors assassinations, executions, and terrible combats,-such as Mr. Vincent Crummles delighted in, with sparks flying from the broadswords at every blow, are every-day incidents with them. But, if the Victoria drama is anything, it is moral. The hanging, drowning, or shooting of the criminals, and the complete triumph of the virtuous is de stigeus, and must be brought aboub by some means or other, however violent. The favourite d6n,nmnent is to Join the hands of the hero and heroine over the dead bodies of two or three of their persecutors, with an ultimited display of blue-fire.
In one respect the Victoria drama bears some resemblance to the productions of the classical school. A clearer idea of itS beauties may be gained from a perusal in the closet, aS the phrase used to go, than from witnessi its represent a- tion. This arises not so much from the hidden beauties of its plot and dialogue as from the fact that the New-cut audiences are not the most attentive in the world, and are more intent upon exchanging the comuliments of the season at the top of their voices, or backing their favourites in the not unfrequent combats which occur before the curtain than on the business of the stage. Owing to this peculiarity our notice of last night's performance must be more general than particular, for were it not thatthe manager, knowingthe difficulties under which a spectator who goes to see the play is likely to be placed, kindly sets out in his bill the chief incidents of his plot, and gives a alight biographical and critical sketch of each of the characters opposite his or her name, we should have but a very dim idea of what DarL Shadowcs and Sunshine of Life ; or, The Wild Gipsy Girl, as the Easter novelty is called, was about. We saw several gentlemen stuck through, fairly and unfairly, and one or two shot, without hearing any reason assigned; but, as the process in each case met with che unqualiaied approbation of the audience, and as all came right in the end, no doubt the ends of justice were advanced thereby. The plot was laid in the north of England, during the time of the Commcnwealth. A young cavalicr marries a gipsy girl, who bad tended him when wounded in one of the battles of the civil war, but by the machinations of an unfaithful steward, wel acted by Mr. Sawford, he is made jealous, turns his wife out-of-doors, and is thrown into prison for the murder of his uncle-the act of the steward himself. Oliver Cromwell, however, who for. tunately happens to be passing that way, sets all right in his dark, mysterious way, and the volley which every one thought was to send the young cavalier out of the world finds a more fitting receptacle in the body of the steward, who is thus " hoist with his own petard" in a summary and most unexpected fashion. These were the chief iRcidents of the plot, and they furnished occasion for niany strong situations and exciting incidents. The piece was well mounted, the scenery good, and the dresses rich and varied. The house was packed as tight as it could hold, but, despite the squeezing and pushing, the cod humour was general, and it was stated that the numcer of pugiUistic encounters were under the average. Everybody knows that etiquette and ceremony are not carried to too great lengths at the Victoria, and if the majority of gentlemen sat in their shirt sleeves, and if the ladies imbibed freely of the frequent pewter pots which passed about, they had a sufficient excuse in the heat of the evening and the excitement of high-toned conversation. There was clearly no lack of enjoyment, and that is the chief thing people look for at a theatre on Easter Monday.
ASTLEY'S.
The Easter holydays were welcomed at this favourite place of public amusemeat by the production for the first time of a grand European and African military spectacle by Mr. C. A. Somerset, entitled The French in Algiers ; oi, the Batlc of Constantine, which enables Mr. Cooke to bring upon the stage, with briUiant effect, his magnificent stud of trained horses, as well as the entire resources of his vast establishment. The opening scene, which is laid in France, presents the village of BeUefleure, and the vine cottage of GuiUaume D'Arteau, who has sanctioned the betrothal of his daughter Marie to a peasant named Albert. In a little while a conscription is made in order to enable France to inflict a terrible chastisement upon the Moors and Arabs in Algiers for the frequent outrages committed by them upon Christian travellers and merchants. While the conscription is being carried out in the little village of Bellefleure Count Edward de MandeviUe, a wealthy nobleman and colonel of a regiment of the line, endeavours with some success to inspire Marie with the ambition of marrying "an officer and a gentleman" instead of the poor peasant Albert; and at length shc is in peril of being connected with the Count by a morganatic alliance, when Albert suddenly rescues her from the toils of "the officer and the gentleman." But although the poor peasant has saved her from dishonoar he finds that his love is not reciprocated, and that she dreans of the falfilment of a prophecy which the Count, to effect his purpose, had artfully palmed upon her, that she should become the wife of an officer. Albert, broken-hearted, departs from her to fight against the infidels in Algiers, and hopes that lie may there lose that life which has become a burden to him, but his sWkill and bravery obtain for him the position of au officer, and by one of the many strange accidents in life Marie, in the chsracter of a Sister of Chaiity, in one of her visits of mercy to the wounded and dying belonging to the French army in Algiers, meets with hin, and a reconciliation is effected, the Count testifying
in his dying otents that her honour has never been tarnished.'Rhe battles fought with the infidels are repreEented with great spirit and effect, and the entire piece gave great satisfaction to a full house. Equestrian scenes an the circle then followed, and the farce entitled The Tailor of Tacmzrorth concluded the evening's entertainment.
THE GREAT GLOBE.
This is decidedly one of the most attractive and most in. structivo of the exhibitions of the day. In addition to its standard merits, with which most of our readers are no doubt well acquainted, the Easter folks yesterday were further gratified with the great diorama of Russia, and a new series of tableaux illustrating a tour from Blackwall to
Balaklava. Both contain some really beautiful pictures, not less remarkable for the sMill with which they are exe cuted than 'he fidelity with which they represent the various towns and cities en route, even to their unost minute details. We have yet seen no dioramas which can compet3 in interest with tbe series of views which portray the aMtack upon the Alard Islands, and take th spectator down the Darube, round the shores of the Black Sea to the Crimea, where they conclude with a lovely painting of Catheart's-hill by moonight. For thos3 who wssh to obtain a thoroughly good general idea of ths tbeatre of the late war, we can most conscientiously recommend this diorama to the notice of the public. The brief descriptive matter which is delivered duineg the progress is clear and to the point, and gives all necessary information w;ithout trespassing too long upon the patience of the audience or doing anything hut interest still further in the subject before them. The diorama of Russia introduces some novel scenic effects, which are managed with great art. The most striring in this, series are the views of Nijni Novogorod during the fair, MscowV, and the Ural mountain, which of themselves are suffiiently interesting to well repay a visit.
The Great Globe is now applied to illastrating the recent discoveries of Dr. Livingston in Southern Africa, on the model of which the whole course of his long wanderings is minutely traced. The route of the proposed Eupates Valley Railway, tho localities of the wars at Canton and Bashire, the line of the intended Atlantic stb. siarino cable, and' the coase and influence of tho Gulf Stream, are also delineated with the utmost precision, and form the basis of a most interesting, explan%tory lecture, whicb, with .t4e aid of the Great Globe, is per. fecty clear and cesig A ss).e, even to children o, thq
least informed upon such matters. The room devoted to Crimean trophies contains the best and most complete series of relics of the late war which we have yet seen. Some recent and important additions have also been mad3 to the waxwork figures. Upwards of 4,000 oople visited the exhibition in the course of yesterday. We can recommend it to the notice of our readers as one of the most varied and entertaining places of rational amusement to be found in the metropolis.
ROYAL POLYTECHNIC.
Mr. Pepper, the proprietor and lessee of this admirable institution, has been indefatigable in his efforts to render its attractions pre-eminent to the holyday folks. The whole of its varied series of entertainments have been remodelled, new features of interest added to those which have been retained, and the places of others supplied with fresh sob. jects, which are at once attractive and instructive. ir. Pepper'? lectures upon applied chymistry embrace several interesting subjects. A brief bat most interesting explanation is given of Mr. Rose's (of Glasgow) newly invented optical delusions called the kalotrope, which are pro. duced by illustrating on a large seale the persistence of images upon the retina after the object itself has passed away. Advantage has been taken of this phenomenon to produce some most cnrious and even startling optical effects.
In addition to these sources of amusement, some new and beautiful dissolving views have been arranged. One series illustrates China and the localities of the present war, and is accompanied by some lucid and interesting explanations of the population, laws, habits, manners, and customs of the Chinese people by _r. Spencer. The second series is devoted to an illustration of Egyptian life and manners in the time of the Pharaohs, and forms a most beautiful and impressive set of views. The pictures of the "life and manners" are copied by photography from the ancient monuments of the pe-iod, and of course display the absence of point and angularity of position so characteristic of Egyptian art. Some views, such as the " Rained Temple by MVoonlight," the " Death of the First-born of Egypt," and the " Rain of Fire," are among the most exqusite speci.ens of these kinds of views we have yet seen. The whole of both series are by Mr. Hine, and those of Egypt are most graphically explained by Mr. L. Buckingham.
The room m the Polytechnic which was formerly devoted to the specimens of ornithology is now set apart for the exhibition of a number of Mr. Stevenb's luminous chromatic transparencies, which were formerly exhibited at the Paris Exposition. Among the new mechanical contrivances in the building may also be noticed M-. Loysers machine for making either tea or coffee, which is justly considered as one ,f the most complete inventions of its kind. No large pub,lic building, such as barracks, hospitals, prisons, &c., should he without it.
A most interesting feature in the Easter programme is the engagement of the celebrated Hungarian band, who perform in an admirable manner in the Concert-room, where Miss Leffler and Miss Hlemming also assist with their fine voices.
During the hours of exhibition yesterday the Polyteeinic was quite crowded, and the various novelties were received in a manner which seemed to bode weHl for their long continuance.
THE COLOSSEUUi.
This popular exhibition has brought forward an unusually attractive programme for the holydays. The principal feature, and one of the best of its kind which we have seen for some time, isa musical and pictorial entertainment, entitled " 7Vc Hals and Mansions of the Enqglish Nobility." It is mainly founded upon pictures in Nash's celebrated work, represented in a most beautifully executed series of dissolving views, in which the old baronial seats and ancient castles of the feudal times are pourtrayed in the most effective and poetic style. All the views are accompanied by a brief but pointed description by Mr. George Buck. land, which is quite as good in its way as the pictures themselves. He is by no means fettered by the dull routine which so often detracts from the interest of such displays, but diverges on every suitable occasion into popular and interesting sketches of the manners and customs of the olden time. The ancient ballads, with wbicb the prose work is also enlivened, were appropriately selected and sung with much taste and an evi(lent apnreciation of their hearty quaint humour. This portion of the exhibition yesterday met with long and well-deserved applause. The diorama of Lisbon, before and after the appaUing earth. quake which almost entirely levelled it with the dust, is represented with startling fidelity ; and the gigantic panorama of London by day is, beyond all doubt, the best executed and most characteristic view of this metropolis which has yet been placed before the public. A most interesting portion of the entertainment, and one which from its peculiar associations is likely to be a permanent attraction, is Kn admirable set of dissolving views of Australia and its goldfields. The peculiar phases of colonial hfe and the various hardships of life at the " diggiDS" are therein pourtrayed in the most striking and characteristic manner, and they certainly afford the best idea af the triumphs and trials of the goldseekers which have yet been seen. Ve must not, however, omit to mention that the various exhibitions we have enumerated are in addition to the ordinary attractions of the building, such as its stalactite caverns, conservatories, fountains, electrical experiments, and its large and interesting series of working models.
The unjust anI vexatious rule which formerly existed bere of charging I s. or 6d. extra for each necaliar attraction bas been quite done away with by the present energetic proprietor, Dr. Bachhoffner. The shilling paiid at the door gives ingress to all parts of the exhibition, to see which, under the old regime, would have cost 4s. 6d. In the evening the per. formances commence at 7 o'clock, with a grand vocal and instrumental concert, for which the fine band of the Crystal Palace Company has been engaged with several clever vocal artistes, and this promises to be a is,ost popular portion of the entertainment. On the whole the programme has been conceived in a most liberal and enterprising spirit, and the public, to judge from their attendance yesterday, seem fully alive to its many merits.
MADAME TUSSAUD'S.
Madame Tussaud's exhibition is without a rival either here or on the continent. All who have attempted comn petition have proved but so many foils to set off the supe rior attractions of her admirable collection of les 7osnmecs ca'i-res. Whether people wish to see the newest statesman or the latest criminal, according as their tastes may lead them, it is but rarely that the orthodox niodel of either is to be found out of the Baker-street Collection. Yesterday, though but few celebrities have been added to the rooms since our last notice, the exhlibition was crowded throughout the day. The Napoleon room in particular seemed a great obiect of attraction, as it well deserves to be, for in no other place in Europe are so many and such touching and important memorials of the great Emperor to be found. Even for a national collection ourgallant allies might be prond to possess the relics which are here preserved, from the plain camp bed on which the great warrior breathed his last to the atlas on which are drawn with his own hand rough sketches of his most important plans of battle. If it only contained the Napoleon room this exhibition would still be one of the cheapest and most interesting to be found in London. But these relies are only a portion of its attractions, an adjunct to the great saloon, -where the fine assemblage of figures requires no pratise. A good likeness of the Duchess of Sutherland haS iust been added to the group of figures behind the Queen's throne. The room of horrors hlas had its gloomy interest increased by the likenesses of Palmer, Robson, Redpath, Strahn, Paul, Bates, and others, more or less notorious. An admirable selection of music, which is well played at intervals during the day, is a feature of the exhibition which deserves praiseworthy notice.
BURFORD'S.
Mr. Burford very justly depends upon the acknowledged attractions of his fine panoramas of Moscow and St. Peters. burg, and therefore puts forth no novelties for the sight. seers. The picturesque and striking manner in which both these great views are painted has already been done justice to in our columns, so that we need onlyrefer to them now as still maintaining their pre-eminence as the most effective and accurate delineations of the two great capitals of Russia. The former pantig, which represents the state entry inta Moscow on the occasion of the recent coronation, is really a good work of art, and one which, by the admirable nanner mwhichthe scenery and grouping of thefigures are managed, gives a fine idea of the great pageant. These paintings in themselves will repay a visit, though we certainly think-, in common with many others, that the attractiveness of the exhibition would be materially enbanced if musical acces sories were introduced, or something attempted in the nature of a descriptive narrative of the many objects of interest which the panoramas display.

EXETER-.HALL.
A mnsical entertainment of a novel and varied character took place last night, under the titlo of the " Grand Verdi Festival," which attracted an immense concourse of people to Exeter-halL For the admirers of Verdi, the popular representative of Young Italy, the concert provided was a real treat, since it comprised a selection of favourite mOrecaux from his three more succesful operas-rl Tro2atore, La Trav,cia, and Rigote4to. The means of execution, vocal and instrumental, n onover, were on a scale of the high2est efficiency. The band was chosen from among the members of the Orchestral Union, and directed by Mr. Alfred lellon. The solo singers were Madame Clara Novello, Miss Louisa Vinning. Miss Dolby, Messrs. -Weiss, Milardi, and Sims Reeves. The chorus ,'was from the Royal Italian Opera. Thus everything had
been done ,to give the utmost effect to the muwsic, and the result was in aU respects satisfactory.
Some curiosity Was excited about the programnmes, which on such occasions generally contain the words of aU the vocal pieces; and it was very naturaUy apprehended that the Exeter-hall Committee, who were so strai.htlaced about the Stabed Hater and the Requiemt, vould entcrtain strong objections to the text of the notorious Trariatc. The committee, however, had, in vulgar parlance, taken the bull by tho horns; and instead of authorizing the distribution of such a carefully edited bill as night havo beea appropriately styled " Beauties of It TrMratore, La Traviea, and Rigoleuo,," condemned all three, by insinuation, as unfit for the sanctified precincts of that edifice which has been pleasantly denominated " the architectural glory of the Strand." To quote the paragraph conveying the intimation, they " interdicted the publication of an English translation of the programme in the form of a book of words." The naughty sentences were aUowed to be breathed and uttered by the " singing men and women," but forbidden to be printed; they might be heard, but not seen. N'importc'; the whole was delivered in the Italian tongue, which " soft bastard Latin" is probably regarded by the Exeter-hall authorities as something akin to hierog.yph.
With regard to the enormous audience that assembled last night at the call of Verdi, it was surmised that three fourths consisted of persons who would on no account have been tempted to visit a theatre, and yet thought it quite legiti. mate to listen to the words and music of La Trar!<ata in Exeter-hall. Whether this was or was not the case, some poetical wag must have considered the themne a good one, since a lyrical squib was circulated in the hall through some mysterious agency which caused no little speculation and merriment.
The performances gave great satisfaction, and there would have been no end of encores had not Mr. Sims Reeves and Madame Novello, who were first honoured by a redemaud-in the scene of the " Aliserere" from the Troratolc-displayed the courage anid good taste to resist it, satisfied to acknowledge the compliment by returning to the pLat. form and bowing to the audience. The malcontents continued obstreperous for a long time, howvever; and when at last Mr. Weiss came on to sing "11 balen," he was saluted, amid considerable applause, with a tolerable amomut of sibillation. The good feeling of the majority, nevertheless, soon stifled these uncourteous sounds, and Mr. Weiss was allowed to wade through that soniniferous air in peace, Another boistorous caU for repetition follo wed miss Louisa Vinning's execution of the caratina, "Tacea la Notte;" but she, with commendable spirit, imitated the example so wisely set by Madame NoveUlo alnd Mr. Sims Reeves. The storm raised by this second disappointment, and k-ept up with great obstinacy, wore itself graduaUy out till it was lost in the stiUl more potent clamor of Mr. Alfred Mellon's orchestra, which brought the first part to an end with some of the most vociferous of the Verdian harmonies and unisons, gathered from the " Selection" so well known to the patrons of the Surrey-gardens. With a portion of the same olla podrida the concert had been im. posingly inaugurated. The other pieces from the Troratore were the duet between Leonora and Count de Luna and tho can:one of Azucena, the gipsey-" Stride la Vampe"-the first of which was intrusted to Miss Vinning and Mr. Weiss, the last to Miss Dolby.
Strange to say, the mnorccasux from La Traviata produced scarcely any effect, although the grand aria of the heroine " Ah forse lui," was admir_.bly sung by Madame Novello, and the brindisi, " Libiamo, libiamo" (which almost "feU dead"f enjoyed every chance of success in the hands of Miss Vinning and Mir. Sims Reeves. The lengthy mock-sentimental duo between the lovers, in the final and noat pthysical seene of the opera (" Parigi o cara", essayed by Miss Vinning and Mr. Iklillardi, went for not ing, nor did the lachrymose apostrophe of Alfredo's easily affected parent-" Di Provenza"-with all the goodwill that Mr. weiss exhibited in its performance, appear to strike the audience with any greater degree of amazement. Probably Handel, Mozart, and Mendelssohn may have wrapped the interior of Exeter-hall in an atmosphere unfavourable to Verdi. At any rate the only piece in the Trariata which Pfforded the least gratification 7was the aria of Madame Novello, abovementioned; and that, we make bold to say, was caused rather by the singing than the music.
The Rigoleo selection began with the introduction and ball scene, andterininated with the polonaisc (for orchestra), the interval between the two being filled up by five of the most admired vocal pieces, aDotted to the singers we have named. After all, notwithStanding its diffuseness and the trivialities in which it abounds Rigolcito is the best of Verdi's operas, and the quartet, " Bella Figlia," tho best of Verdi's compositions. If only lie could always write in this manner, or in the manner of some parts of the Trovatere, he would perhaps neither be so rich, so prosperous, nor so eagerly idolized by the untutored and listless crowd, but he would stand a better chance of outliving himself in liis music.
The concert, which had been announced to commence at 7 o'clock, did not begin till nearly 8, owing to the nonarrival of the band-the consequence of a misconception, which Mr. Alfred Mellon explained succinctly and clearly. The audience exhibited a wonderful degree of moderation, considering that they were kept waiting nearly three-quarters of an hour; and although manifestations of impatience were frequeut, there was no approach to a " row " and all dissatisfaction was allayed after the apology of M. Mellon.
The Bluecoat Boys And The Lord Mayor.-
THE BLUECOAT BoyS AND TIIE LORD MIAYOR.- Yesterday being Easer Monday, the boys of Christ Hospita7 w4lked in procession, accompanied by their masters, to the Royal Exchange; thence they proceeded to tbe Man. sion-house, where they were joined by the Itight lion. the Lord Mayor, the Lady Mayoress, the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, Aldermen, Recorder, lUnder Sheriffs, and Common Councilmen, with their ladies; thence they proceeded in state to Christ Church, Newgate-street, where the Lord Bishop of Salisbury preached the Spital sermon, which wr.as eloquently delivered, and the entire service devont]y performed, the whole of the children being present. At the conCusion of the service they adjourned to thE Grand Hall, when the reyort was read of the number of children and others waintasned.
AXOTIIXR FATAL BOILER ExrLoSIoN.-A terrible boiler explosion took place at the Leebrook Works, near Wednesbury, Staffordshire, on Saturday last. The works belong to Messrs. Bagnall and Sons, and the occurrence happened unfortunately at a period of the day when a number of the workmen were actively engaged on the spot. One of three boilers all closo together burst with a terrific explosion, scattering the brickwork of the building in every direction over an area of 100 yards, and killing two persons, besides fearfully mutilating others, somiie of whom it is feared will rot recover. 'I'le boiler separated into two immense pieces, one of which was hurled into a canal which runs near, and the other, after being projected a distance of SO yards, made a breach tbrough a stone walL The names of the deceased are Bridget Fox, widow, aged 34, whose body was mutilated in a frsghtful manner, and who was killed on the spot, and Julia llinn, aged 26, who recaived such shocking injuries that sho died on Sunday. The women, withothers, were engaged in washing a kind of cinder used by blacksmiths. The boiler is said to have been nearly new and in good repair, and rumours vary as to the cause of the explosion. A coroner's inquest, however, is about to be held on the bodies of the deceased, when no doubt the circumstances of the explosion will be fuly invesigated.
TsaR COLLuRY EXPLOSION AT STOCmrORTSTOCErORT, April 13.-The bodies of the three persons who were kiWed by the explosion of firedamp in the lBredbury New Pit on Saturday were removed to thc Rising Sun Inn, about half a mile from the mine. This moming the inquest was coanmenced before Mir. Johnson, the coroner for this division of Cheshire, and a respectable jury. The coroner having briefly stated the nature of the inquiry, the jury viewed tho bodies of William Holwarth and his two sons, which were placed in a stable at the back of the inn. The father and eldest son were disfigiured from having been choked by the sulphurous vapoura produced by the explosion. The youngest son presented a frightful spectacle, several of his limbs being broken. lUon the return of the jury the coroner adjourned the inquiry to Monday next, at 10 o'clock, to give the Government inspcetor for the district an opportunity to visit the mine. It is understood that the inspector has fixed Saturday next for his visit, and there is ro doubt that he will be in attendance at the adjourned inquest on the foUowing Monday. Great sympathy is felt for the widow of Holwarth,who is left with four young children. Thomas Redfern, one of the men who were injured, lies in a very precarious condition, and it is believed that he wll not live. The other four men are also in a dangerous condition, and it is doubtful -whether aU of them vill recover. Workmen are at present engaged in replacing the fixtures in the pit which were blown down by the explosion, and up to the present time the colliers have not returned to their work. This is the first serious aeident of the kind that has happened near Stockport for many years

AUSTRALIA.-The following are extracts from & letter addressed by Sir George Stophen to Messrs. Butterworth, of Fleet-street :-" We have about 80 barristers and 260 attorneys. Perhaps 50 of the former and 200 of the latter get business-this may enable you to judge of our law,.
market. Some of the attorneys make very large incomes- _ from 7,0001. to 14,0001. per annum. There may be half-ha dozen who are thus prosperous. The bulk of them, perhaps, realize from 8001. to 1,8001., and some few scarcely earn a subsistence. Among the barristers tbere are three,. perhaps four, who make 5.0001. per annum, about a dozen who make from 2,0001. to 3,0001., and the rest who get anything vary from 1,0001. to 2,0001. Many, however, get little or nothing, and several have lately abandoned the profession as a hopeless case. You may rely on this as a sub. stantially accurato report of our professonal position, if any of your friends snake inquiry of you on the subject. The, large majority both of barnisters and attorneys are Irish but the leading men in either branch are English.
