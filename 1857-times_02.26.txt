The school now number nearly 300 children, about 60 Of WhoM are from 11 to 20 years of age, many having attended regularly from its comimtncement, owing t the walchfujneew of as effcient and devoted ak body if teachers as cnn anywhere be found.

An AssoiatIon has been established within the last six mnonths for tlieYoun¶1meu of the School, under the title of " The Trinity Snuda, scheol Sc olare' Chri4tirn Arecciation." Rooms have beoren con

It wilt at onoe be seen that, In order tomraintain thisBSchool and Asrccintlcn, it is asiolutely necessary that a permanent building be provided as eoon as possible, and, under the tryigand unexpected circumnstancs in which the school is placed, the President;, teachers, and others iuterested in this ueaful workr, now eamnestly anpat Cbrittir. friendato aid thema in erecting a scbool-howse for she=nic tiotn of the children on week days as well as Sundays in thin dark and naeglected locality, where the population in wrapt In a perpetual winter of withering poverty.

-TUEIE Report issed to the Plroprietary for the SUr
JA months last past presenits a gratifying ontrst to those inu of late, years at the sa=i-annual moeeting. The sectisn relating tolocomotives, seasn tickets, and frePe asse evince a spirit of determined economay. The reslutionto0increase ocomotiveand roling stoc out of revenue, instead of chargingthem tocapitalaocount, eing pr
culaLrly deserving ofyour ,comamendatoion In1l1kemanner it haheetna resolved to rescind, or not to renew, the agreement withithelforth of Europe CDmPany rebltlreto cattle. by which our Companyweas botmd t,oconvey that desmiptlon ofyproertyatr,0ionsl low rates. The ReVort, after alluding toceiart expensive IsWais (amicablyelandre
sonably settled), and certain minor points of cab dicpline leIto their own proper developement, expresse the very prope resdilution of enteringintono arranr.etent except of a reunerative kind. ThisTvery proper business like way of umanagig the Company Is, however, ap~jplied in reference to another CoDrpeny. of which I havpen to know somewhat, viz., the London, Esowich, and Continental Steam-packet Comapany. 41, Mlooricate-etreet.
I am given to understand that, unlike the grasping Policy of the NotthofEurope, the Directors of thisCo0Upany oelysekteaid, andhbe aided by. thegreat :.fsterzi Counties RAilway proprietary, uipon the usual fair basis of luo rata, division of expenses and profits The natural capabitltes of Harwich are such, that under a due developsmeet It must become the SouthamptonL or Liverpool of the East Coast. a dltisotlon which only oeaportin that extensveT6eaboard etn claim witliher,o viz., Grimsbsy. Surely the apthy which a long eours of misfmanagement hbs piruueed will ceas to paralyse our energies to the extent of letting siptbls glorous primefromn our gap. Steam-ship compsa3ioihavno expensive ladtoperchasetheigistnof way through, no0 expense of rails, no long bills for surveys, and other preliminary phiebotomy. Renas £lOOeOO is even a large capital for acom an.
Iough ittonly expresses 10 sharehokldersof t1,000 . eachorw10ofo£2
each, Such an amountminght readily be raised outof orown bmroordstarp thereby enabling the Marin C ompany to contract, or at least tender, for the coesTyanoe of the =&Uls for the whole of the north of Emnope and India (viiA Trleste), In preference to the present te rr ieus routes by Calasi and Dover, with, their concomtantpFwhacks of scuds and breaks of rail whenerer thoyreach the thine. For these rreriasstheFPest-ofce pasethe South Ea-tern steam Packet Company £10,50D per annumn. Suppose £,7000 or &OOo thereodirctedinto this uewroute. Thisimpliesnot only a dividend to that amount per cent, on the Steam Ship Comcpany's s'hares, but the carziage of the mall matter on the Eastern Counties
Apart from this, the co=97tilre smoothnes of the sea, passae from araic, owig toIts'm$above the various currenits that beset teSristeready communication from Harwich to all England without passing through London--and the direct anid unbroken lines of raU from Botterdam to Coogne and theRhine-indleate this as the ourtain route foyr at least a fair proportion of the autumnal tourise while a'll travellers to Place east of the Rhine, and all1 the overan

REMOVAL Or, IISH PAUPERS.
Mr. BAGWELL rose to ask the Chief Secretary for Ireland whether he could afford any information upon the subjectof a pauper woman named Nugent, who, after residing 1 yeaxs in London, was removed to Ireland by the
n uthorities.
Mr. HORSMAN said he was not able to express an opin3ion whether the removal of this wooman and her children was legal. The law was that if a person had resided for five years within the same parish in England he could not be re-
moved. He would take care to put the matter in a train of inquiry
IRISH REFORMATORY SCHOOLS.
Mr BAG WELL wished to know whether it was the intention of the Government to introduce any measure for reformatory schools in Ireland?
Air. HORSMAN said that last year the Government had introduced a Bil on the subject of reformatories in Ireland which was not acceptable to the Irish members, and it was accordingly withdrawn. There was no reason to suppose that another Bill would be moreacceptable, and the Governmont were of opinion that it would be better to wait and see what improvements were made in the law of England, and then to introduce a Bill for Ireland.
SEA-COAST FISHERIES BILL
Ir. M'MAHaON moved the second reading of this BilU.
31r. J. FITZGERA-LD advised the House to reject this measure. The hon. and learned member for Wexford had introduced a measure substantially similar to the present in 1855, which was thrown out by 196 votes against 19. The present Bill was even more mischievous than that of 1855. At present the sea-coast fisheries of England and 8cotland were protected by certain safeguards and restrictions, hut the result of passing the lion, and learned gentleman's Bill would be to leave the sea-coast fisheries of Ire laud entirely unprotected. The Fishery Commissioners had recommended that the Irish fishery laws should he made applicable to England and Scotland, but the Bill proposed to repeal all the fishery laws which had worked so well m Ireland thab the Fishery Commissioners had recommended their adoption for the rest of the kingdom. The greater portion of the fish taken upon some parts of the rish Ooast was caught bv Cormish fishermon, who, with boats weU found and well manned, yielded obedience to the regulitions of the Fishery Commissioners. It was idle to attribute to the fishery laws the reduction in the number of Irish boats and men employed, since that circumstance arose from the greater demand for labour in more lucrative modes of employment. He trusted the House would discountenance the introduction of a new BiU on this subject every year, and would trust to the present law and the regulations of the Fishery Comnissioners, rather than resort to the mischievous provisions of the present measure.
Colonel DUNNE regretted that he could not sunport the Bill. He confessed he did not think that the Bi would answer. As to inland fisheries the existing law worked -very well. He was sorry to oppose the hon. and learned gentleman, who had shown so much zeal and talent in Irish affais. (Hear.)
Mr. KENNEDY was at a loss to know what good objection there could be to asstmilate the laws relative to the sea-coast fisheries of the three kingdoms.
hfr. J. EITZGERALD.-There is nothing about assimilation in the Bill.
Mr. NAPIER said that the greater part of the BiU was a transcript of the Bill of 1855 w-hich the House had rejected after full discussion. He diEnot think the Bil was altogether what it pretended to be, since it did not assimilate the law of Ireland to that of England and Scotland. There was a special code of general law applicable to England and Scotland, and the Fishery Commissioners had also the power to make local regulations for those countries, but if this Bill passed it would sweep away the laws relative to Ireland, ant then where would be the assimilation7 (HEcar.) Ha -opposed the present hill as he had opposed former bills of a aminilar character, but he thought it would be well if the fishery laws were consolidated.
Mr. GROGAN thought the Attorney.General for Ireland had taken a wise course in obiecting to the bilL Considerable benefit had been experienced from the operation of the last Act, and he was anxious that it should have a further trial. If the consolidation of the fishery laws were to come under consideration there might be found many parts deserving amendment. Great difficulties arose from mnouths of rivers not being properly defined.
Mr. BOWiYER stated that, as the Attorney-General for Ireland had said that the present biU might be good for Wexford, bust it was not good for the rest of the country, hie thought it right to observe that he had received letters from the north of Ireland urging him to give his support to the bill, as being a measure important to the whozs of Ireland.
Captain SCOBELLtShoucgrhtthfat there ould be one lawappicale o al te ishrie oftheream, ndtrusted that te present bill would be allowed to pass through a second reading, and be submitted to th c onsideration of a
Mr. G. BUTT said it would be impossible to appl one general fishery law to the different eircumstances of the three kingdoms. The Irish fishery laws provided for the establishment of commissioners, who had the power of making by-laws suited to the different localities. He should therefore vote against the sond reading of the bill.
Mr. MEAGHER was of opinion that it was desirable to consolidate the fishery laws, and to consider whether some improvement might not be effected in the seacoast fishery. If the hon. meme r pressed the second reading to a division, he should vote against the biU.g
Lord NAAS said that though the BiU was described by its author as having for its object the assimailation of the Irish and English fishery laws, yet the measure proposed to remove the Irish restrictions without enacting the English restrictions, which were found to work beneficialy. The object of the bill really was not to interfere with the deep twions respectinutthe esatukary sfishoing.a Ief the estuaries were throwzn open without restriction the race of salmnon would De very shortly destroyed.
Mr. BELLEW could not support the BiUl ; he believed that a particular class of smaU fishermen in Ireland would be annihilated by its operation. He wished the hon. member would bring in a Bil to consolidate the fishery laws, instead of proceeding with the present.
Mr. M'MAHON maintained that the arg~uments made use of against the Bill were not founded on its provisionas, but on those of former Bills. So long as he had a seat in that Eouse he would never give up bringing forward this question untll Irishmen were allowed to fish their seas as free from restrictions as the people of England and Scotland were in carrying on their fisheries. Under the present :1shery, laws the Irish fishing trade had diminifished. Nothing could b more prejudicial to the Irish fisheries than the ncnsistentandunjustly restricive regulations issued by the Fishery Commissioners, 'who were wholly ignorant of the trade with which they were allowed to interfere. Cornish fishermen were allowed to fish on the Irish coasts, and sold what they caught there to the Irish peoPle, while Irishmen would be prosecuted for daring to fish on their own coasts. Surely that fact alone ought to induce the House to amend the present Irish fishery laws.
Mr. MACEVOYsupportedtheBEM, and, referringto a statement of the Secretary for Ireland, on the occasion of the motion for leave to bring it in, to the effect that the proprietors of Englsh and Scotch fisheries would gladly exchange the English and Scotch fishery laws for those by which the Irish fisheries were governed, said he doubted very much its correctness, because he felt certain that if such were their sentiment, English and Scotch members would long ago have introduced measures to assimilate the English and Scotch fishery laws to those of Ireland.
lr. O'FLAHERTY hoped that the hon. and learned gentleman would consent to withdraw his Bi, because he felt that it would ruin many of the Irish fisheries.
The HouNse divided.

JIUDGMENTS' EXECUTION, &c., BILL.
The House then went into committee upon this BE. Upon clause 1,
Mr. WM?ARON said that, as the hon. and learned author of the Bill Mr. Craufurd) proposed to exempt the Sheriff (ourts in Sotlaud from the operation of the Bill he
should withdraw an amendment of which he had given notice. ' ehdgvr
Colonel DUNNE thought there was a sort of compact entered into on the last occasion between the hon. andlearned mernber for yr (Mr. Craufurd) and the House that the bill should be reprinted before the House was asked to discuss t,paned hnntrusted thatthecommittee wrould be again post-
Mr. CRAUFUURD denied that he hnd made any such iromise. He proposed to include the Court of ComPmou s at Bancaster and the Court of Common Pleas at Durham in the Bill. An amendmnent had been suggested by the Attor. ney-General for Ireland to the effect that a copy, instead of a mere memorial of a judgment, should be transmitted to a court out of which it might be desired to issue execution under this Bill, but ho (Mr. Craufurd) could not accede to that proposition, as bethought
it would enta-l unnecessary expense. rJl proposed to limit the time within which execution 7*ht be obtained as
matter of course on judgments underthis Bill tO 12 months; after which time it would be r.ecessary to make a special aPPlication for execuition.
Colonel DUN.E disclaimaed any intention of imputing bad, faith to the hon. member (Mr Craufurd.)
Mr. CRAUFURD moved an amendment, the effect of which would have been to include in the operation of the Bill judgments obtained in the Court of Common Pleas at Lancaster and the Court of Common Pleas at Durham - but, after a short conversation, in which Mr. G. Burr anl Mr. J. D. FirTzaERAui urged the importance of having a copy instead of a memorial of the judgment, to adopt which, Mr. CRkupuRD said, would be to adandon the principle of the Bill, the amendment was withdrawn.
Mr. J. D. FITZGERALD then moved an amendment to substitute a "c opy " for a " memorial " of the judgment sought to be enforced.
After a short discussion,
The committee divided, when the numbers were-
For the amendment .. ... ... 99 Against it .. ... . , ... 77
Majority ... ... ... - -22
Mr. BOWYER then moved that the Chairman report progress.
Mr. CRAUFURD seconded the motion, in order that he might have time to consider whether it was worth while to proceed any further with a BilU of which the Attorney-
enerafor relandhadsieccededin destroying theprinciple. Progress was then reported, and the House resumed.
SAVINGS-BAITKS.
The resolution agreed to on Friday was reported to the House, and a Bill founded thereon ordered to be brought in.
COMMONS' ENXCLOSURE BILL. This bill was read a third time and passed.
BANKRUPTCY AN.D INSOLVENCY (IRELAND).
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL for IRELAND moved for leave to bring in aBill to consolidate and amend the laws relating to bankruptcy and insolvency in that country, and explained that the measure was nearly similar to one wlmch he introduced last session, and which passed a second
Mr. VWHITESIDE observed that the condition of the law of bankruptey, and the coniict of jurisdiction now existing in regard to the winding-up of commercial and other companies, were a disgraco to the country, and called loudly for the interference of some authority sucoh as that of the proposed newv department of justice.
Mr. MALINS concurred in the remark of the hon. and learned gentleman as to the state of the bankruptcy, insolvency, and winding-up law of England, and hoped that no time would be lost by the Government in rectifying the deplorable state of things thus engendered. He trusted, also, that this bill would give an appeal in insolvency as well as in bankruptcy cases.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL for IRELAND said, that on every question of property the measure gave an abeolute right of appeasl in insolvency cases. The point referred to by the hom. and learned member for Enniskillen had not been lost sight of, as the bill provided a perfect scheme for winding-up in all cases not covered by the Joint-Stock Companies Act of last session.
The motion was then agreed to, and the House adjourned at half-past 5 o'clock.

(From a Supplement to the London Gazeeu of Tuesday.)
We published yesterday the names of those upon whom this most enviable honour had been conferred. We now publish the ground on which each was selected as worthiest, among so many brave men, of the honour conferred upon him -.
ROYAL NAVY (INCLUDING THE NAVAL BRIGADE;
Enr-LOYED ON SHORE) AND ROYAL MARINES.
CECIL WILLLUM BUCKLEY, Commander. -Lord Lyons reports that-" While eerving as junior lieutenant of the Miranda, this offlcer landed in presence of a superior force and set fire to the Russian stores at Genitchi," and " he also performed a similar desperate service atTaganrog., The fix-st service referred to occured after the shelling of the town of (Genitchi, May29, 1855. After mentioning that the stores were in a very favourable position for supplyimg the Russian army, and that therefore their destruction was of the utmost im-
rtnce, Captain Lyons writes:-" Lieutenant Cecil W. ruckley, Lieutenant Hugh T. Burgoyne, and Mr. John Roberts, gunner, voltmteered to land alone and fin the stores, whlich offer I accepted, knowing the imminent risk there would be in landing a party in presence of such a superior force, and out of gunshot of the ships. This very dangerous service they most gallantly performed, narrowly escaping the Cossacks, who all but cut them off from their boat." (Des&atch from Admiral Lord Lyons, June 2, 1855, No. 41.) The second volrmteer service was performed whilethe town of Taganroj was being bombarded by he oas o te fee, sd t i tus recorded by Captain Lyons:-"1 Lieutenant Cecil Buckley, in a four-oared gg accornm ed by Mr. Henry Cooper, boatswain, and mann'ed by vomnteers, repeatedly landed and fired the different stores and Government buildings. This dangerous, not to say desperate service (carried out in a town containing upwards of 3,000 troops, constantly endeavourin to prevent it, and only checked by the fire of the boats' gu-ns) was most effectually performed." (Despatch from Admiraa Lord Lyons June 6, 1855, Nio. 429.)
JoHN TAIsOT BURGOYNE, Commander.-Lord Lyons wnites:-" As senior lieutenant of the Swallow this offder landed with Lieutenant Buckley, and Mr. J. Roberts, gumner, in presence of a superior force, and set fire to the stores at Genitchs,-a service of imninent ri3k." (Desp%tch from Admiral Lord Lyons, June 2, 1855, No. 419.3 ) B. -This service haa been previously described in the preceding notice of lieutenant Buckley's services.
JoHN ROBnr.TS, Gunner.-This warrant officer landed with Lieutenants Buckley and Burgoyne at Genitchi, in presence of a superior force, and set fire to the stores-a service of imminent risk-. (Despatch from Admiral Lord Lyons, June 2, 1855, No. 419.)
Hnmsy CooPrB, Boatswain,-Performed the desperate service of landing at Taganrog, in presence of a large force, to set fire to the Government stores. See preceding memoir of Commander Buckley. (Admiral Lord Lyons' despatch, June 6,1855, No. 429.)
JOsErHTRHTEWAVAg, Seaman.-'Tarticularlymentioned s baving cut the hawsers of the fl6ating bridge in the Straits of Genitchi, under a heavy fire of musketry, on which occasion he was wounded." This service was performed by the crews of the capin's gig and one of the paddlebom boats of the Beagle unTer a heavy fire of musketry at about a distance of SO yards; the beach beinz completelylined with troops and the adjacent houses filled with riflemen. Joseph Trewavas iS especially mentioned in the despatchlesas havin
been the person wvho cut the hawser. (Despatch from Admix-al Lord Lyons of July 10,1lo55, No. 546.)
JOSEPH KELLAWAY, Boatswain.-" While boatswain of the Wrangler, in the Sea of Azoff, was taken prisoner after astoutresistance, while ezndeavouring to rescue Mfr.Odevaine, mate." This gallant service was performed on shore, near MarioupoL A detachment, consisting of Mr. Odevaine, mate; Mr. Kellaway, boatswain ; and three seamen, had been despatched from the Wrangler to endeavour to burn some boats, fshing-stations, and hay stack, on the opposite side of a small lake. They had nearly reached the spot when they were fired upon y a party of 50 Russian soldiers, who suddenly rushed from their ambush, and endeavoured to cut off their retreat. One man fell into the enemy's hands, but Mr. Kellaway and the two other seamen had contrived to make good their escape, when Mr. Odevaine accidentally fell. Kellaway, apparently imagining him to be wounded, without a moment s hesitation returned to his rescu3, risking his own life to succour his commanding ofricer. Unfortunately, while lifting up Mr. Odevaine, they were surrounded by the enemy, and, notwithstanding a galant but hopeless resistance byMLr.Kellaway, they were both mcade prisoners. Commander Burgoyne, who has furnished these particulars, observes, "I was myself an observer of the seal, g"allantry, and self-devotion tatcharacterized Mlr. Kellaway's conduct." (Despatches from Admiral Lord Lyons, Sept. 8, 1855, No. 746;i and Sept. 22, 2855, No. 796.)
GEORGE Frory DAY, Commander,-With great enterprise and gallantry, landed, and successfully carried out a reconnaissance, within the enemy's lines at C-enitchi. This service was performed by Commander Day with the view of ascertaining the practicability of reaching the enemy's gun vessels, which lay within the Straits of Genitchi, close to the town. It was performed by Commander Day alone on a dark but fine night, with the assistance of a pocket compass. After traversing four or five miles of low swampy ground, occasionaUy up to his knees in water, he at length advanced to within about 200 yards of the vessels. From the perfect silence on board them it was his conviction that they were without crews, and when he returned it was with the full impression that the expedition was a feasible one. This opinion, however, he was induced to change on the following day, in consequence of the increasing activity which was apparent in the direction of the vessels, and therefore he determined on maling a second visit to the spot. On this occasion the night was a squally one, and the Journey longer aund more difficult than before. On reaching the spot, finding the vessels manned, and their crews appazenhon the alert, he decided that nay attempt to surprise them was out of the question. (Despatch from Admiral Lord Lyons, Oct. 9, 1850, No. 844j) NB.-It was
a reconnaissance on the same ground that Captaia l'A Ism nd, of the Frenchsateamvessel houette, lost
JOHN EDv.uD Colmm-ERELL, Commander,-" When commanding the Weser, in the Sea of Azoff, crossed the Isthmus of Arabat, and destroyed largc quantities of forage on the Crimean shore of the Sivash." Ths enterprise was
formed by Comm-nderCommerell, at night, accompanied y,y Willham. Rickard, q&rtermaster, and George Milestone, A.B. Having hauled their small boat across the Spit of Arabat they traversed the Sivash to the Crimean shore of the Putrid Sea. The magazine of corn, of which they were in search, lay about two miles and a-half off, and to reach it they had to ford two rivers, the ara-su and the Salghir. The forage and corn, amounting to 400 tons, were stacked on the banls of the latter river, in the vicinity of a guardhouse, and close to from 20 to 30 mounted Cossaeks, who were encamped in the neighbouring vilage. Commander Commerell and his two companions contrived to ignite the stacks, the rapid blazing of which alarmed the guard, who pursued them to the shore with a heavy fire of musketry, and very nearly succeeded in taking them prisoners. (Degpatch fromn Admiral Lord Lyons, Nov. 6, 185, No.
WmrIxM RICEARD, Quartermaster,-" Accompanied his commander, Lieutenant Commerell, of the Weser, to the Crimean shore of the Sivash, and, while under a heavy fire of musketry, remained to assist George Milestone, who had fallen." (Despatch from Admiral lord Lyons, 6th Nov. 1855, No. 899.) The service performed by William Rickard is thus described by Commander Commerell in his despatch:-" I must bring to your notice the excellent condect of the smallr who accompanied me, more espe-
daly hat of Wilia Rcr,qutemaster, who ,though much fatigued himself, remained to assist the other seaman, who, from exhaustion, had fallen in the mud, and was unable to extricate hims,elf, notwithstanding the enemy were keepng up a heavy fire on us, At the distaneof3or4

MONEY-MABKBTa CITrIKTELLU ar
Wednhe e y Evening.
The English funds have bees steady to-day, with a tendency to increased firmness towards the close. COnsols for money, which left off yesterday at 931 to J, were first quoted 93'g to , but there was almost imnediatey a return to 931 to t, at which they remainedthroughout the day. For the 5th of March the last price was 93i to 94, while for the new aceount on the 8th of April it was 941 to W. The. demand for money was not iugent, and the rate upon Government securities was 56 to 6. Bank Stock closed at 218 to 220; Reduced, 94 to k; New Threeper Cents., 994 to {; India Stock, 219 to 222; India-bonds, 2s. dis. to Il. pm.; Exobequer-bond,, 98; to ;; and Exchequer-bills (June), paxrto 3s pm. (advertised), la. dis. to 2s. pm.
The demand for money in the discount-market and at the Bank was again active to-day.
There was increased activity in foreign securities, and quotations in some cases were rather firmer. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 956; for the account, at 951, i, and 96. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the transactions were at 101 and 5. The other general operations comprised-Austrian Five per Cents, 93; Mexican, 21*and .; Peruvian Four-aud-a-E[alf per Cents., for account, 80k; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44j and F; the Three per Cents., 1856, 43i and 43; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97j and 98i; Sardinian Five per Cents., 901; Spanish Three per Cents., 40i; the New Deferred, 24k and g ; Spanish Certificates, 6, and i; Venezuela, 37; the Deferred, 14X; Belgian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 98k; and 1)utch Four per Cents. Certificates, 98k.
the corn-market this morning was without alteration.
The final prices of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. for,nioney and 7Of. 20c. for the account, showiiarantsnprovement of an eighth.
Yhe telegraphic accounts from China to-day show no variation in the rates of exchange, either at Canton or Shanghai. With regard to political affairs one despatch says, " The suburbs of Canton have been fired by the Admiral, and it is feared he will have to abandon his position from want of troops."
From India the Exchange quotations are favourable, that at Bombay being 2s. 1IV. to id., exhibiting a decline of 2 per cent.; while at Calcutta it was 2s. 2id. to id., which, although nearly the same as by the last mail, indicates a slightly downward tendency. These quotations have caused a little depression in the silver-market, and in somne quartera there has been a disposition to throw doubt upon them, but they have been receied from more than one source. The announcement of the opening of a new 6 per cent. Indian Loan for3,000,0001., which has long been considered mevitable, possesses considerable importance, but it is questioned whether the step has not been delayed until the time is past .vhen the amount could be raised wvith facility, even -;t that rate.
With reference to Indian investments the President of the Board of Control has just made another attempt to stimulate British capitalists to expend money in that country without requiring the security of a guarantee. There is little probability that the advice will be followed, but a few words of caution may be desirable. The peculiarities of Indian railway investments are that they lie at a distauce beyond European supervision; that the influential classes of the country, who alone are fit to direct them, are almost exclusively in the civil or military service of the India Company; that the India Company are tho sole landowners; that the advantages of the works, although prospectively very great in a commercial sense, are primarily of a military and political character; and that the government of the country not being vested in the public no one could calculate on the future contingencies either of war or other events that might interfere with the basis on which an outlay might be originally undertaken. The Indian Governinent, in inviting persons to part with their money under such circumstances without offering them a guarantee, would assume a most unworthy position. It would seem bad if a body of lauded proprietors in England were to concoct a railway exclusively throulgh their own estates, and to use efforts to induce people to put thair hard savings into it, wlhile they themselves refused to risk a single penny; but this would be a weak comparison with similar conduct on the part of the India-house since in the one case the investors would have fuli power over their property, while in the other all the legal and political iifluences by which it might be effected would be entirely out of their cognizance. The pertinacious endeavours lately made to induce the unguarded transmission of capital to India are the more objectionable from the peculiar experiences of the money-market during the past five years. The drain to that region has been sufficiently rapid, a-ad, although it is highly desirable that its resources should be opened up. it wil be better both for India and this country that the movement should be gradual. For many years every argument to promote these enterprises was used in vain, and now the difficulty is to keep them within proper bounds. By abstaining from urging the formation of unguaranteed companies, and by refusing to grant guarantees except for such works as are most immediately essential, it is in the power, however, of the India-bouse safely to regulate the entire question. Certainly no works should be undertaken in India about which there can be the slightest doubt of a much larger return than 5 per cent. This return may be in the shape of traffic, or in that of an augmentation of the value of land, or in that of economy of military resources. On these points it is for the Government to judge. If the answer is satisfactory, they can have no objection to offer a guarantee of 5 per cent. ; and in the contrary case they can have no right to strive to le%d the public into the risk. Even when a guarantee is granted, the terms are quite as favourable for the India-house as for the investor, since they involve repayment out of future surplus profits and the right of requiring at certain periods a reduction of the tariff. Thus far the experience of Indian guarantees indicates that in every case the Government wiUl be pecuniary gainers by them. AU that is necessary is that success should not lead to indiscriminate extension, and that the fact should be borne in mind that there is a well-defined limit to the capital in this country annually available for such purposes.
The Board of Trade returns for the past month were issued this morning, and show that, notwithstandingthelarge totals exhibited in 1856, the present year has opened with an augmented business. The declaredvalueof ourexportations has beenl,083,3191. in excess of those of the corresponding month of last year, a large improvement being observable in cotton, silk-, and woollen goods as well as in metals and saddlery. Altbough these tables have been issued with increased despatch they are in a greatly extended form, and furnish evidence of a constant desire to render them as useful as possible, the principal countries being distinguished whence our imports are derived and to wfhich our exports are despatched. The annexed table of exportations of British produce and manufactures shows the exact increase or decrease under each head

The Manchester advices mention that the failure of Messrs. C. Fraughiadi and Sons has brought down four Greek firms in that city, one of them with liabilities for 50,0001. At Liverpool, from the same cause, the stoppage has been announced of Messrs. Fustana and Co., with liabilities estimated at 60,0001. In the latter case, however, the assets are alleged to be large.
An impression seems to be entertained that the North of Europe Steam Company is about to be added to the list of public undertakings, the management of which has lately damaged the administrative reputation of our commercial men. For several
years the directors have declared dividends ranging ; from 8 to 10 per cent., and at each meeting the most unqualified descriptions have been given of tho entire prosperity of the concern. There has been a total exemption from casualties, and, although the company benefited considerably from the employment of some of its vessels as transports during the war, it was announced as recently as August last that its prospects had, if possible, become brighter than ever since the opening of the Baltic trade, consequent upon the return of peace. The only drawback to these periodical representations has consisted in the making of fresh calls, but these were represented as simply necessary to provide vessels enough to prevent the great profits that were available from being seized by others. Nevertheless it 'was always found that the shares could not be retrieved from a discount, and that, whenever the highly satisfactory statements at the various public meetings led to any recovery, there were constantly sellers to take advantage of it. It has now been announced that, owing to the indisposition of the manager, and the decease of the accountant, the general meeting which should have been held this month must be postponed to the 26th of March, and simultaneously there has been a further severe fall in the shares, which has brought them to a discount of between 30 and 40 per cent. The mere fact of the affairs of a public company being allowed to fall into a position in which the illness or death of any two of its officers can render an immediate statement of its affairs impracticable is in itself discreditable, but the shareholders will probably be disposed to overlook that point if they can be satisfied that the representations hitherto made to them have been strictly correct. In that case it will be evident that those who are now parting with their shares are doing so in idle panic. If, on the contrary, it should appear that the position of the company is not uinquestionable, a serious account will have to be exacted from all concerned. The great respectability of the directors seems to preclude the possibility of there being anything reaUy wrong, and there wil be every disposition to entertain that reliance even in the face of the unexplained symptoms now observable in the market for the shares.
It is estimated that the shipments of specie by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer for India and China on the 4th will be about 750,0001., principally silver, a considerable quantity being engaged for Shanghai.
At a meeting of the English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank heldto-day, lIr. C. Johnston presiding, a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, free of Income-tax, was declared, and the report and accounts were unanimously adopted. It was stated that the progress of business has been satisfactory, and that no increase has taken place in the total of bad debts. The advices received since the accountshavebeenmadeup confirmthis fact andshow that operations continue to be conducted with prudence. Strong testimiony was afforded to the caution exercised by the inspectors and managers, and the experience gained during the late Australian crisis will it-is beleved, prove advantageous. The increase in the item of bank premises and furniture, now 46,3881., was explained as arising from the completion of the banking establishment in Melbourne and the purchase of a site for a suitable building in Sydney. The London estabEshment in Cornhill has at present cost about 3,0001., but a further outlay 'will be required, bringing it to about 5,0001. This property is held on lease for 80 years at 5001. per annum, and the portion which can be let off wiU produce about 5701., so that the payment by the bank 'will not be more than the interest oni the money invested. The whole of these investments are considered valuable, not only as requisite for business, but for ultimate realization. Several of the shareholders complained of the insufficiency of detail in the accounts, particularly as regards the item of 10,7121. current expenses, 'which, however, was explained to the satisfaction of the meeting. With respect to the remuneration to the -Board, it was mentioned that they have not divided the 3,0001. a-year allowed by the deed, but have been contented with 1,5001. and 2,0001., the mux1imum amount being -viewed as exceptional, under circumstances of great prosperity. Of the paid-up capital about 100,0001. is employed in England. A discussion took place on the duties of auditors, and Mr. Alderman Salomons, who has entered the direction, availed himself of the opportunity of contradicting the allegation said to have been made by Mr. Hlumphery Brown, M.P., in reference to the affairs of the Royal British Bank, -viz., that the directors of joint-stock banks are at the mercy of their managers. Annexed is an abstract of the report and accounts .
"1 Trhe directors have pleasure in referring to the annexed statement of liabilities and assets, which they feel will be gratifying, as it exhibits a decided improvement in the general operations of the bank. The progress made during the year ending the 30tlh of Septemberlast in the business Of the branches will be seen by comparing the following items-viz. :

The balance of profit and loss account is equal to 7 per cent. per annum on the capital. The arrangements for opening a branch at Adelaide have not been completed. The increased amount at debit of hank premises arises from paymnents on accoutnt of the buildings in Melbourne and London, and the purchase by the inspector of a very eligible plot of freehold ground at Sydney whereon to erect a banking-house, all of which the directors consider advantageous investments. The directors have satisfaction in informing the proprietors that the inspector and managers report the onrrent transactions of the branches to be of a very safe character, and that the provision alardy made to meet estimated losses in the colomes will be found amply ffaficient. They t4erefore xecommend that the balance of 17,M., at the credit of profit and loss account, be appropriated as follo s:-To thepaymentof a dividend attherate of 5prc4t = oper annum (free of income-tax) on, 50O,000&, the pd-up capital of the bank, 12,5001.; towards the reduction of the *1nounts at debit of bank premisea and fur ore count, 9401.; preliminary ezpensea,-500l. ;-leaving 4,o1s. to bo e iaiedto thte reacry fund.

At a meeting of the Submarine Telegraph Company this afternoon the dividend declared was at the rate of 7 per cent., and the report and accounts were adopted. It appears that the revenue, after deducting working expenses and 10 per cent. for the reserve fund, shows a balance of 2,9761., which will provide for this distribution and leave 2631. to be carried to the credit of the current half-year. The directors state that an arrangement for a complete amalgamation has lately been effected between the British and Magnetic Telegraph Companies, by
which arrangement all the continental messa-es of the MagneticeCompany, in addition to those of the British, will pass through the Sabrnarine cables lif either Calais or Ostend.
At a meeting of the Southampton Dock Company to-day the dividend, at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, was conflrmed, and the report was agreed to.
Advices received at Lloyd's to-day from Constantinople, dated the 11th inst., state that boisterous weather had been experienced, which had interruypted navigation. The French steamer from Marseilles was over due two days, and other trading vessels were also out of time.
The following extract of a letter from the Chincha islands, dated the 9th of January, states that they are at present in possession of the party in Peru who have revolted against President CastUla. It also describes the services of Her Majesty's ship President in preserving order, and preventing the abduction of men from the vessels engaged in the guano trade:-
"The country is in a disturbed state, but through Captain Frederiek, of Her Majesty's ship President, we have not suffered, although the 'Revolutionists hold possession of the islands. The shipping is very much indebted to this captain in many ways; any complaint he hears he comes m person to decide; is always ready to give his advice, and while lying in Callao is constantly chasing the crimps. During the last three months he has taken a number of boats while in the act of stealing non. If there were a few such officers on the coast that vile system would be entirely put down. The shipmasters have presented a letter thanking Captain Frederick and his officers for what they have alreadyl done, to which he replied that he was now enabled to press the Government with the importance of carrying ou what he has begun."
The amount paid into the Treasury of the East India-house for bills on India, from the 10th to the 25th inst., was 48,8501.

Serious Charge Against A Gentleman.-A
SEKIOUS CHARLGE AGAIST A GEEsA.-A gentleman of large property, named Joseph Ho good, who vas once in practice as a surgeon, was charged refore the Mayor and magistrates of Tiverton on Monday with administering to Mrs. Craze, the widow of an ironmonger of the same towii, and for whom the prisoner was acting as trustee, a noxdous drug, with intent to procuae abortion. The details of the case were of a most disgusting character; and it was admitted by Krm Craze that before and after her husband's death she had had criminal intercourse with the prisoner. She wished to take medicine to procure abortion, btatleged that Er. HoXgood told her '?that no pianin Enegland would do it. She sent for asurgeon named Bedell with the view to effect her purpose ; but, after an interview with him, she said she did not ask him to do it, and that this gentleman cautioned her not to take any medicine. It was proved that Mr. Hopgood had given Mrs. Craze two pills, but they woer not of a noxious character, and were not such as would be likely, as stated by several witnesses, to prour abortion. After hearing a number of witnesses, howvever, the mag,istrates committed the prisoner for trial at the ensuing Devon Lent assi2es, but a4cepted bail of 3'JO'J for h~is appearance.

The Scottish Freehold Movement.
I HEr SCOTTISRF BrEEDOLD. MOVxEMEwj
A meeting of membergzof Parliament vho rdppor&ed mr. Locke King's motion for the .extensiont' of tlisountr frawchise in England wAvd held on, Ttaesday at Cth King's ArmsHotel, NewPalace-yard, Westmimnter,forth6'pnrpose I of bearing the explanation of a deputation from Scotland,
Consisting of the Rav. Dr. Begg, Basilie Grieve,. anid Mr. I Duncan iLaren, on the subject of extending to Scotland
the 4s. freehold franchise of England. Among the members present were Mr. Cobden, Kr. LAin', Mr. Tom
son, Mr. d. B. Smith, Mr. Baxter. Mr. L. Heywood, Mr. T. Bell, Sir Joshua Walimsley, Mr. A. Black, and Mr. G. DIncan. There were also several well-known politicat Reformers present.
Mr. M'LAREN having taken the chair said, that there was no franchise in Scotland similar to the English tog. franchise. Every voter in a Scotch county must be either a 501. a-year occupier, or the owner of a 'house or land of the value of 1Ol. a-year. This was the first greyitece. The second was, that no man having propert in a city or borough could vote for the county. The consequence othis law was to throw the whole power of electing county members entirely into the hands of the agricnltuainteregt. All the property, both in the counties and in the 'towns below the value of 10!. a-year, was wholly unrepresented, By a fiction of the Scotch law everything within a borough was held to be out of the county. The practical efect of this was that there were not more than two counties in Scotland the members of which were not returned by some one or two great landowners who were peers, and therefore members of the UpperEouse of Parliament. Thiswas A fraud upon the constitation, and was felt to operate more severely in Scotland than in England, because in Ehgland there were 359 borongh members, while there was lessthan half that number of county members, whereas in Scotland the boroughs returned only 23 menbers while the counties returned 80 members. In that w-ay tho Scotch boroughs were deprived of a large proportion of that power which the English boroughs enjoyed. There i*as no justification for this difference in the representation of the two countries. A Bill was passed last session to assimilate the merocntile law of England and Scotland. If it were a right thing to unite the commercial law, surely it was equally a right thing to unite the political law. These were tbe leading points on which the deputation desired, on behalf of Scotland, the sympathy of the meeting. Re had not met a single Englishman who did not admit that the Clasm now mLde by the people of Scotland was inanswerable. Indeed, many members of Parliament wero actually ignorant of the inequality that existed between the electoral franchise of the two countries. As there was no general Reform BiUl bef-ore Parliament, they were desirous of obtaining this instalment for Scotland. When that was gained, and England and Scotland were put on an equality, they could run the race together for whatever further reforms it might be desirable to obtain.
The Rev. Dr. BEGG observed, that the electoral rights of the two countries at one time were precisely similar. Scotland was deprived of the 40s. franchise in 168l for the pur-
se of putting down the political influence of the smaller 8ovenanters. The people of Scotland then fell into a state of vaassalage and degradation, and continued in that state till the passing of the Reform Bill, which they were glad to obtain, notwithstanding its imperfections. Scotland claimed the 40s. franchise on the broad ground of justice. Its possession would induce the working classes to save and acquire property. The Scotch were described as a drunkens nnation; an there might be some truth in that allegation; but the great mass of the people were acquisitive, and if they knew that it was in their powrer to obtain the franchise they would eschew drink and become the holders of property. There was a time when the two great families in the county of Lanark were at variance. The house of Douglas fought with the house of Hamilton, and in the struggle there was some liberty secured ; but the Humutons had gone over to Rome, and there was no opposition nowv.' Mr. B. Cochrane, the memoer for Lanark, was nominated by two persons only, the whole mass of the county looking on. Mr. Cochrane no more represented the political opinions of the people than he represented the inhabitants of China. This movensent had only been about two months in existence, but nothing had occurred in his time in Scotland which had made such a rapid progress, or had ga ined so much inluence over the common
Mr. LiwRXXCucs thought the claim to be so reasonable that no one wAould object to it, but he w,arned the deputation ;gainst relying on Lord Palmnerston for support, for there was no man more remote in feeling and sympathy from the Reformers than the present Prime Minister. Of this any one might be convinced who had read the noble lord's speech on the motion of Mr. Locke King.
The Rev. Dr. BEGG said, the deputation waited on Lord Palmerston as Prime Minister of the country, without knowing the line which the Government, after considering the question in aU its bearings, might take.
Kr. LCoDG said, he was determined that at all events the questhon should be brought before Parioament, and an a- peal be made to the people of this country whether tho same political rights should not be enjoyed by the people of Scot-
land,asidpen already conferred on the people of Eug-
ter. COBDEN said, he had been asked to move the follow-
onsutch demandsand thatme with mush satiorsation ot the efforts now making in Scotland to procure the extension 0l tho 4e3. franchise
Tel rntolle, nd cs pexXculi irc=umances of thai eeuntry, not only just fy. hot inspetlvelyrequire. Tbat in the opinion of thisimeeting ofsuh emns, and that the YScottish teRfeortmhers,l in rtohe steaps wehi°ch tbsy are now taking, ace entitled to the eamest and zealous support of their English brethren."
Hie begged to move that resolution, and to say on his own behalf,and he was sure he spoke thesentiments of all the Liberals in the House of Commons, that he should be very happy to give this niovement his support, provided there should be any necessity, but he really hoped that so very reasonable a proposition would meet with no opposition.
Mr. Coox EvA.NS seconded the resolution. He accompanied the deputation when they waited on Lord Palmerston, and that noble lord did all that could be reasonably expected. He listened to their arguments, and said he would take the matber into consideration.
After a few observations from Mr. A. BLACK, Mr. B ins, Sir J. WAmtsLry, and Mr. VAUGHAN,
The CHAt7Bm said that the committee in Edinburgh had considered the suggestioR which had been referred to, by Mr. Black--namely, that those who had votes for boroughs should not have votes for counties, and the zomneittJee were unanimous against it. A similar propositioni was made to Lord John Rscusell on the occasion of the great Reform Bill, when that noble lord said that if the tovwna were left out of the county franchise he would rather have
The resolution was put and carried unanimously.
A corresponding committee was then appointed, and, after a vote of thanks to the Chairman, the meeting broke up.

London, Thursday, February 26, 1857.
LONDON, THURDAY, FEBRUABY 2X, 1857.
la the House of Commons yesterday 1r 3M'MAIow moved the second reading of tho Seacoast Fisheries BiL.
. Jr. FITZGERAD, in moving to defer the second reading for six months, obEerved that the Bill mi ht be very good for Weiford, but for the resli of e.
land it would be most inexpedient and mischievous, and he advised the House rather to trust to the present laws.
ColonelDuN opposed the Bill, whlch he did not think would answer.
Mfr. KExNDY was at a loss to understand why an assimilation of the seacoast fishery laws of England, Scotland, and Ireland could be objected to.
Mr. NAPMK= denied that this Bill did assimilate the several laws.
The BiU was oppoeed by Mr. GRooA, Mr. G. B3UT, Mr. MEAG-nR, Lorl NAs, and Captain BELLEW; and supported by yr. Bowyrs and Captain SCOBrLL.
Mr. M'AHox made ac detailed reply to objections, insisting that his object was merely to make Irish fishermen as free as Englishmen to fish upon the high seas.
Some observations were made by Mr. M'Evoy and Mr. O'FLAr&nTr, and the House divided, when the amendment was carried by 185 to 10; so the Bil is lost.
The House then went again into committee upon the Judgments' Execution, &c., Bill, but, after a division upon the first clause adverse to the views of the framer, Mr. CBA&U?UD, the Chairman, reported progress, in order that that gentleman might determine whether he would proceed further with the Bill.

If the Chinese question admits of elaborate legal
If the Chinese question admits of elaborate legal argument and conflicting technicalities, it is also, we think, capable of being laid before the public in a very simple form. The first point raised concerns the nationality of the vessel upon which the alleged outrage was committed. It is questioned whether she had really acquired such rights as rendered it necessary, according to treaty, that certain alleged delinquents then on board of her should be claimed through the British authorities, instead of being arrested by Chinese officials at their own discretion. Now, we ask the reader to follow us through the actual details of the occurrences as they are described in the published despatches. The Chinese, in a heavily armed boat, board the Arrow, then lying off Canton, and carry off their prisoners. Information is forthwith communicated to our Consul at Canton, who proceeds to interfere by repairixg immediately to the scene of disturbance, and requiring the restitution of the men at the hands of the very Dfficers who had seized them, but who had not yet monveyed them from the spot. In every single incident of these proceedings there is the assumption on every side alike that the Arrow was a British vessel within the meaning of the treaty. Its own baster must have thought so, or he could; not have invoked the inter-vention of the British Consul; the Consul must have thought so, or he would not have responded to the appeal; and that fhe Chinese actually engaged in the busines did not, at any rate, think otherwise is perfeetly evident from their recorded behaviour. When Mr. PARKEs went on board their war-boat, and lemanded that the prisoners should be restored, in pursuance of a certain treaty well known to both parties, what was their answer ? If they had elieved the Arrow to be a Chinese vessel, exempt %ltogether from British jurisdiction, their course was plain and their reply very easy. They had only bo state at once that the Consul was wrong in interfering; that the Arrow was not British, but Ohinese ; that our authority therefore di not protect her ; and that they were making their -rrest in a proper and lawful manner. Not one of these statements did they make, although, if they had imagined themselves to be acting in a straightforward and ordinary way, such a reply ought to have risen involuntarily to their lips. We learn from the Consul's own words, written, be it observed, on the very day of the occurrence, wrhen the whole affair was fresh and as yet unDomplicated, exactly the recoption his expostulations encountered. Not only is there not a syllable recorded of any such self-justification on the part of the Chinese, but there is actually an undesigned proof that they felt themselves not to be justified, and that they had been urged by special motives to overstep their righis. They had heard, they said, that a man whom they were authorized to seize wherever they found him was on board the Arrow, and they considered themselves at liberty to carry him away without any previous reference to the Consul, lest this should lead to his escape. Now, when it is remembered that, according to the most distinct depositions, the Arrow had the British flag actually flying, we think there can hardly be a doubt that the Chinese officers, as well as our authorities, believed the Arrow to be such a vessel as would come under the provisions of the treaty.
But there is something more to be drawn in the way of evidence from these opening details of the rupture. So little disposed was Consul PARimS to convert a small disturbance into a great one, and so desirous was he to close the affair at once, that he hastened, as we have seen, in person to the spot, and endeavoured to reclaim the captured men "before they could be conveyed to a " distance." In order, too, that the Chinese in charge of the prisoners might be relieved from any fear of their escape he called upon them to bring them to the Consulate in their own custody, and if this request had been complied with there would have been no rupture at all. The Consul apprised them expressly of the nature of their trespass, and took, in fact, precisely the same ground maintained by our authorities throughout. He went, he says, "to explain to them, if it were possible that they "had acted in error, the gross insult and violation "of national rights which they had committed, and "the heavy responsibilities they thus incurred." To all this, as above-mentioned, they made no reply whatever in the way of justification, or on the grounds of the non-British character of the Arrow. All they said was that they had seized their man for fear of his escape, and that they would resist his reeapture by force.
Of the demand for admission into Canton we need only repeat that it could not have had any influence on the resolutions of the Chinese Commissioner in rendering our appeal to force necessary, inasmuch as force had been already appealed to and the Barrier Forts taken when the point of that admission was mooted. About its expediency in the abstract there may be differences of opinioa entertained, but we must say that if anything could prove the necessity of some free conamunication between the authorities of the two nations it is this very rapture. Take the circumstances of the whole case, not according to one version or the other version, but in their own naked plainnes, and what appears? Why, that no quarrel could ever have taken place if. there had been room for the two partie3 to understand each other. Obgerve that in the matter of the lorcha there was no concealed question at.stakeno undercurrent of controversy. If the Arrow had been a smuggling veusel, or if the aleged delinauent had. been some contrbandist in whose impunity it might have been fancied we had somo interest, the cmse would l'ave boeen uttered; but as it wfas there could it, r il .ve been no difference of viewa whatovt- .+t F, Consul PAnxE Pad Oommiision4 O. A manx charged wiih piracy '--4 seaid to be on board I a certain v! .sel, the jurisdiction over whichb
pertained either to the Chinese or the British. How could it possibly signify through what agencyhe was arrested, or with what forn of procedure he was tried ? Suppose, even, for the sake of argument, that the capture had been first effected under the circumstances which actually occurred ;-if the two authorities could at once have met together, what should have prevented their agreement? The Arrow was either British or Chinese. If YEB could have established the latter fact, fr. PABIEs would [bave had no demand to make; if Mr. PABKrS could
have proved the former, YEH would still have been abieto secure the condign punishment of the culprit in custody. Nor can it be reasonably argued that a personal interview might have been of just as little avail as written correspondence proved to be. In the latter case there is room for endless mistake or misrepresentation ; while in the former, besides that such riaks are avoided, there appears a kind of impossibility that two reasonable persons meeting face to face should not come to an agreement when there is nothing to differ about. If all that Yxu really wanted was to deal out just retribution to a convicted pirate he could not in any way, upon a free conference with Mr. PARKaS, have missed satisfaction; if he wished to insult our authorities, the rupture must have come anyhow.
Once for all, we ask, what should have been done, or where should we have stopped sooner than we did stop? When the Master of the lorcha, the Consul, and aU concerned were persuaded that the Arrow was a vessel under British protection, and as such had been subjected to outrage, could the matter have been left without notice? When we had asked for moderate and simple reparation, could we, considering that we were dealing with Orientals, have done otherwise than support our requisitions by force? True, this force was pushed home when, on the 29th of October, our Marines penetrated the city and visited Yxn's residence ; but, as he himself the day previous had deliberately ordered the extermination of Englishmen and set a price on their heads, his measures were at least as forcible as ours. If, in short, we were waranted in demanding redress, common prudence required that we should not suffer the terms of our demand tto be evaded; if redress was not granted it was equally necessary that we should not desist from our efforts to obtain it until a point had been reached at which our ascendancy was placed beyond dispute.
Two documents just published seem to bring to a
Two documents just published seem to bring to a fitting close the inquiries and controversies respecting the war. Both afford valuable information to the future historian, and are ful of interest to those who have taken any part in the late discussions. The one is a Return to an Address of the House of Commons concerning the lete Army in the East; the other is the list of brave men honoured with the Victoria Cross, and a record of the services by which they have earned it. We will take the Return relative to the Arny first, both because it is of the greater importance, and because the events with which it is connected are best treated of,before turning to a more pleasing theme. The Return, then, gives the exact numbers of the British Army which was engaged in theEast during the two years of the war; the original strength of each regiment on joining the expeditionary force; the date of arrival in the East; the total number of non-commissioned officers and men received after landing up to September 9, 1855 ; the nunmber of mnen who were killed or died up to the same date; the number who were invalided or became non-effective through other causes; and the strength of theArmyat the taking of Sebastopol. Thenumber actualy killed in action and the number wounded are also given in separate columns. Now, this accurate and comprehensive Return is certainly a justification of all that has been stated respecting the mortality in the Army. The newspapers of January, 1855, asserted facts which were contradicted with real or feigned indignation by certain Ministers at home. Tne present Return confirms the original statements, and altogether disproves the denial. A few months afterwards the Crimean Commissioners calle to conclusions similar to those of earlier observers on the spot, and in his recent pamphlet Colonel Ttuioci reiterates in forcible language his statement that the mortality was excessive and i in a great measure preventible. Out of 10,000 men he declares only 1,200 were cut off by epidemic-the rest perished by disease which was capable of mitigation, if not of prevention. The disaster at Walcheren, he says, sinks into insignificance beside that of the Crimea, which has never been paraUeled in modern times. Let those who think this language exaggerated attend to the figures now at last furnished by the Government itself.
The general total of aU the regiments or corps which originally landed in the East was 55,530; the total of non-commissioned officers and men who were added to these during the progress of the war was 27,371; thus the total of British troops from first to last amounted to no less than 82,901. Of these 18,927 were kIlled or died. But in another column we have the number killed returned as 2,598, and as of the 11,361 returned as wounded only 1,848 subsequently died, we can well believe the statement of Colonel TuLLocn, that up to the time of his inquiry 10,000 men had perished, independently of the losses infilicted by the enemy. But there is one fact which has not yet been sufficiently brought forward,-how many men were disabled by sickness without actually finding a grave in the East? The answer given in the Return is startling. No less than 11,374 men were invalided or became non-effective up to September, 1855. Put, then, these two numbers together-the 18,927 who actually died, and the 11,374 who were disabled-and we have the total loss of the Bnitish army 30,301 for a period of 18 months, only 12 of which were passed in presence of the enemy. In round numbers, out of 80,000 men we lost 30,000 during the war.
This is the principal fact to be learnt from the Return, but the record of the actual numbers of the different arms is not uninteresting. The strength of the original regiments of Cavalry which went out was 4,819 ; the draughts amounted to 2,001; the total Cavalry was therefore 6,820 from first to last-a goodly force, considering the character of the struggle. The whole loss of the Cavalry in dead and invalided was 1,587,-considerably under the average of the Infantry regiments, but no small proportion in itself. The strength of the Royal Artillery, on joining, was 7,032, which was increased afterwards to 8,944 ; the losses amounted to 2,25 6, and tbe number left at the taking of Sebastopol was 6,688. Of the officers 157 in all were killed and 579 wounded during the war, a number exceeding the proportion among the men under their command, though, as the officers enjoyed a comparative immunity from sickness, the total balance is in their favour. Of the Cavalry 8 officers were !-illed and 22 wounded; of the Atiery 10 killed and 30 wounded; of the Engineers, 9 killed and 12 wounded; of the Infantry 119 killed, and 422 wounded; of the Staff 11 Illed, and 20 wounded. Of the Cavalry horsesaL01 were killed and 2,226 died during the war.
* We may now turn to a more cheerful subject. The Victoria Cress} for bravery in th6 field or afloat, has been awarded to a number of distinguished officers and men in the Army, Navy, and MarinegL It has been decided that this decoration shall be given only for courage displayed in the presence of the enemy. Skill or conduot does nxt
entitle a man to the distinction, nor can the soldier earn it byextinguishinga fire in a powdermagazine at home, nor the sailor by gallantry in saving his vessel in a storm at sea. How far this limitation is founded on a just basis must be left to the authorities and the services to declare; but, if bravery in actual war is to be pre-eminently rewarded, there is certainly no reason to be dissatisfied with the list of names and achievements published in Tuesday's Gazette. We can only mention a few of these, and, though where all have done so well any preference may be invidious, we may give instances of gallant conduct in each branch of the service to show what kind of merit the Government has selected for reward. In the Naval Brigade Captain WILLIAM PLSL receives the Cross for having, "on the 18th of October, "1854, at the greatest possible risk, taken up a "live shell, the fuse still burning, from among several "powder-cases outside the maagazine, and thrown "it over the parapet (the shell bursting as it left his "hands), thereby saving the magazine and the lives "of those immediately round it." To this brilliant act the Captain of the Diamond added two others. At the Battle of Inkermann he joined the officers of the Grenadier Guards, and assisted in defending the colours of the regiment when hard pressed at the Sandbag Battery; and on the 18th of June, 1855, he volunteered to lead the ladder party at the assault on the Redan, and carried the first ladder until woumded. Captain PZE1:'s claim to the reward of his threefold gallantry wil hardly be contested. Of the campaign in the Baltic siniilar acts of prowess are recounted. GEonOz Il(aouvmLz;, Captain of the Mast, in a boat action off Viborg, saves the second cutter of the Arrogant, which had been swamped, and had drifted under a battery, by jumping into the sea, though wounded, and catching hold of the painter. Lieutenant CHAPnLEs D. LUCAS, like Captain PmL, throws overboard a live shell during the attack on Bomarsund. In the Army, Private SAMUFuL PARES, of the 4t1i Light Dragoons, saves the life of Trumpet-Major CnAwFOrou at Balaklava, after both their horses had been killed. PARnKs defends himself and friend against six Russians, whom he " kept at bay, and retired "slowly, fighting and defending the Trumpet"Major for some time, until depfived of his "sword by a shot." Corporal JoHx Ross, of the Engineers, obtains tho Cross for, among other achievements, " intrepid and devoted "conduct in creeping to the Redan in the " night of the 8th of September, and reporting its "evacuation, on which its occupation by the "English took place." Private ANTHoNy PAL=Sr "charged singly upon the enemy, as witnessed by "Sir C. RussEII, and is sai-d to have saved Sir C. "RIssme's life." Breve-Major Lnv;iAY, of the Scots Fusileer Guards, is distinguished for having " at a xnost trying moment, with a few "men, charged aparty of Rmsians, driving them "back, and running one throiwh the body himrself." PriTate JOHN CoNonS, of the 3d Regiment, " dis"tinguished himself most conspicuously at the "assault on the Pedan in personal conflict with the "Russians; rescued an officerof the 30thReginient, "who was surronnded by Russans, by shooting one "and bayoneting another, ard was observed inside "the Bedan in personal combat with the Ruwians "for some time ;-was selected by his company for "the French War Medal."
These exploits seem to carry us back to. the warfare of Troy or Ascalon, and it is pleasingg to be reminded that, in spite of science, the struggles of nations are not reduced to a mere nmechanical destruction of human life by long ranges and monster shells. Ve sincerely congratulate the brave recipients of the new decoration, we eongratulate the nation which cotunts them among her sons, and the SOvEREIGN who receives their allegiance and gives her name to the distinction they have earned. It is a happy thing that in a country with such disparities of rank and fortune the display of great qualities is able to unite the noble and the low born, the rich and the poor, in a common honour. In the present instance merit seems to have been rewarded. without prejudice or favour. While such a spirit prevails in the selection there is no danger to be anticipated to the popularity of the Victoria Cross.
It is curious to observe two different sets of
It is curious to observe two different sets of principles struggling for the possessisn of the working classes in this country, especially the unemployed and distressed part. One is the old Chartist ground, worked by Mr. EBNZST JoN-s, and vWe shall venture to call it a thoroughly obsolete and antiquated one. We know that the new light is the very boast of the Chartist, but he never was more mistaken; he is, in truth, a very oldfashioned person; his whole idea of movement, progress, and sowial improvement belongs to the school of JACK CADE; he is full four centuries behind the rest of the world. There is the old and young revolution, just as there is the old and young fashion, manners, medicine, law ; he is the old revolutionist, formed upon the medimeval type, and saying almost exactly what WAT TYLER said four centuries ago. His mob-oratory reads like a scene in an old play, when a mob leader comes on the stage and gives his plan for rectifying all social evils, and preventing any more poverty or misery in the world. The aristocracy are charged with maliciously preventing the cultivation of the " waste lands." Let the " waste lands" be rescued from their gripe and subjugated to the plough, and there will be plenty for every man in the country to eat and drink. There needs only this to bring back " merry England" and the golden age. This is the old-fashioned agrarian dream that inspired our JACK CADES, and to hear it again now that modern thought has so long shown the absolute absurdity of this kind of scheme for rectifying the evils and grievances of society is like going to sleep and waking up again in the 14th century. Mr. ERNEST JoNEs doubtless plumes himnself on being the nman of the day; but that is just what he is not. The spirit of the age is too thoughtful and too experienced to swIow such a creed ; it is too argumentative and atilitarian to be carried away by a dream; it admaits the guidance of facts alone. No fairy story whin do for it; no vision of agrarian perfection and " twenty millions of acres of waste land," exactly accommodating the population of England, and leaving no man without his beefsteak and jug of ale.
Nothing can show the blindness of the old Chartist more than that, with the explored and ascertained earth's surface before him, and the known fact that whole waste continents are eagerly demanding and will amply repay the workman,..
that with Australia, Canada, and the United States inviting labour from the overstocked nmarket in the Old World to fill ip the vast void inl the New ont, he ahould still obstinately persist in dissuading the working classes from Emigration. Yet such is the case, and thero is no bugbear that he will not raise in order to prevent men from going to the New World and to keep them at home. Think of the boldnesm of s man actually asserig that the New World is overstocked, that it is fuller than the Old one, and appealing to the pauperism of New York as a proof of it, as if a city now rapidly advancing to the population of a million afforded any criterion of the demand for labdur in the uIacultivated irnmensities of the bank-woods, or Canada, or Australia ! New york is, of course, overatocked 'with raechauiis for the salwe reaseor thai
London is; besides that it is the principal landin port for emigrants, a crowded population will produce exactlythe same effects in theNewWorld that it does in the Old; the New World is not recommended because it is new, but because it is not as yet full, and for the very reason that people are told to go to the New World at aU they are told to go to the empty parts of the NewV World, and not to the full ones. But the Chartist, intent on his domestic agrarian scheme, thinks, or pretends to think, that he can lodge all of us safely at home, and, while everything in the world points with irresistible plainness to Emigration as the remedy for an overstocked home market, he indulges in a dream of stationary happiness upon Salisbury-plain and the South Downs, with rustic cottages and rosetrees; and, not content with ignoring the facts of the New World, he claims them on his own side, and, taking the bull by the horns, positively dissuades men from emigration on the ground of the New WVorld being overstocked. There seldom was a more complete instance of an antiquated vision fighting against facts and opposing the plain results of new knowledge and discovery.
This is one set of principles, then, which is struggling for its share of the working classes. Another is represented by the meeting of the " British Workman's Association," held on Tuesday evening, for the purpose of obtaining assistance to Emigration. Here we have no obsolete and visionary ground taken up, but the new, the solid, and matter-of-fact one. The line taken by the " British Workman's Association"' shows that the working classes are fast getting out of the reach of bad argument, that theythemselves see the facts of the case, and the conclusion to which they point, and cannot be deluded by visions. Their meeting takes exactly the opposite ground to the Chartist one, and is all for Emigration, as the remedy to 'which all the circumstances of the age point.
It would be a great calamity if such a spirit as this were not well met, and if the appeal for assistance to emigration made at this meeting were not warmly received; and therefore we hope we shall not be thought inquisitive if we say that we should like to know rather more than we do at present of the expenditure of those vast sums which the Colonial-office receives from the Colonies for the purpose of Emigration. What becomes of all this money ? Does this money do as much as it ought to do t What is the sum annually received, and how many emigrants does it send out ? These are serious questions. Our correspondent Mr. Howlsr informs us that " for the years 1852, 1853, and
1854 the proceeds of the sales of land in. "Victoria alone were about 800,0001. per annum, "and that half of this sum was appropriated to
bringing over labour." He adds, that " these "were almost entirely the proceeds of tiolm allot"nments, but that since that time public opinion "has compelled Government to throw iato the "market a considerable quantity of waste lands "for agriculture,"-an alteration which must have added largely to those sums. Our correspondent does not charge the Colonial-office with any want of zeal or industry in this cause, but at the same time he thinks that, as a matter of fact, the " technical rules by which it is tied up," with reference to grants, " do obstruct Einigra" tion." If this is the case, with the great pressure of unemployed labour now upon us, it is certainly worth while considering whether these rules should not be reconsidered, and the system made more free This is a p-oper time for remodelling the plan, if it wants it. Here is large call for assistance to Emigration, which ought to be met, and met as effectively as possible. We hope to see something done.
The Arctic discussion of Tuesday night may be
The Arctic discussion of Tuesday night may be felt as a great relief by al persons who are not under the influence of the ice mania. Were there the most distant probability-we had almost written, were there the faintest possibility-that any further effort could prove beneficial to any living member of the late Sir JOHN FRANxLIN'g ill-starred expedition, we should be the first to say " Let the effort be mpde I" 1Eleven years, however, have now passed away since authentic accounts of the wanderers have reached us. We l;now that they passed the winter of 1845-46 in a. small cove between Cape Riley and Beechey Island, facing Lancaster Sound. To complete the sum of our information upon this most painful subject, we should add that, according to Dr. RAE's account, a party of 30 or 40 persons were seen to pass over King Villiam's Island, near the mouth of the Great Fish River, in the year 1850, and, according to all human calcilation, they must have perished in that year. Such, we believe, was the end of the crews ofh the Erebus and Terror. We are now told that some intelligence of the most dubious charactsr has reached one of the ports of the Eudson's Ba- Coimpany, which would seem to indicate tha.i whita men had been seen in a remote corner of the inhospitable region which is visited by the Esnguimaux and Indians, and upon the strength of t;bis additional information we are asked to rGesew our efforts. It should be mentioned, on the other hand, that this intelligence, such as it is, iS disbelieved by the hlgher officers in fte employment of the Hudson's Bay Company. It would ber most assuredly our duty to give o'ir poor lost; countrymen the benefit of the doubbr were such .
term applicable to the incidents cernected with their disappearance, aid had not tha lapse of tfim absolutely excluded hope. This is.the point upoa
which, above all others, we wish to fix p-l3lia attention. There is no consideration which unvl} justify the despatch of another Arctic Expedition save the one of 3escuing somrm- few surviwFrs of FRANKLIN'S company. Now, or fixed opini;m, and that of most oth&r persons, is tiat they hm3te long since ceased to be rec1aned amon3p living men. We are not justified, then, in plazhig other ships and other crews in circumstancees precisely similar to thece under which they perisWd, merely for the sake f rescuing a fow books, an:d journals, and record. of the expedition. Theze would, nio doubt, be a kind of melancholy astisfaction irl knowing the exact details of the event. It is possible that some journal or diary, like that which was kept by Ajax GARD NER, when he lay a-starsing on Tierra del Fuego, might be reseed from the ice. Are we justified, however, in exposig another expedition to a similar risk for the remote and slender chance o so xeeertain aid barren a result?
It is most satisfactory to find that Sir CHAULEs WOOD has at last taken a firm etand with reference to this question, and has definitively announced that, as far Ms the British Government is concerned, the cycle of voyages in search of Fit-mL is closed. This is the true polley, and the true merey. Tis determination will receive the hearty assent of ninety-nine men out of a hundred who are capable of forming an opinion upon such a subbect at all. Without making any pompous allusions to the sarifices which this country has already mnade in order to carry relief to her missing children, wo n,y surely be permitted to say that there is a reason. able care for the living as well as a reve. renee for the dead. FRANLixN and his gallant followers have long since been where human aid i cannot avail them ;-dare we take it upon
ourselves to recommence so fatal an under. jtaking as that in which they perished? 7'We will
u not venture to predict what may be the case l when mience and navigation have uwde even aoe
gigautio strides than they have done in our own ti.e ; but for the present let the Polar Seas relmain sealed water to all but the adventurous 'whaiers who may be pleased to tempt fortune on *their own account at the edge of danger. Leave -these inhospitable regions to the Esquimaux, to the swalrus, to their long sunless winter; they are n1ot fit quarters for civilized man. We accept Sir 'CIARTes WOOD'S declaration of Tuesday as an 'earnest of a wise decision :-"HerMajestys Govern4 ment wAil not give any enc0oiuagement to the I't proposal to send ecmt another Arctic Expedition."

The Insurance Tax.
THE INSURANCE TAX.
TO THE EDITOR OF TfE TIMES. I Sir,-It strikes me that another rather strong argument may be added to those in your leading article of this morning against the insurance tax.
In London and probably most other places where the building lease system prevails it is not true, as the advo. cates of the tax assert, thatthe outlay for insuranceis voluntary. Alid it is true that the landlords or their agents will not recognize the well-known principle of the self-insurance of large numbers of houses or ships belonging to the same * Owner.
The fact is that the insurance is at first a conipulsory tax, imposed on the tenant for the benefit of the landlord, and -quite unnecessnry, except in the case of an insolvent tenant, if the lease contains proper covenants; and then that is made the fulcrum for a furthler compulsory tax of 200 per -cent. more by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
No doubt, it is a very pleasant thing for the agents of th) Marquises of Westminster and Salisbury, the Dukes of Bed-ford and Portland, and Lords South mpton and Portman to be able to throw all this vast quantity of business into -the hands of whichever office they like to patronize; but it is rather too bad that their tenants should not only have to insure all London for them, but be fined 101. besides for every 51. we pay in doing it.
Yours obediently,
E. B. D.

New Route To The Continent, Via Harwich And Rotterdam.
F'EW ROUTE TO THE COATTlNzA T, VIA I -HARWICH AND ROT7EBBDAM.
Dlany years ago, before the Thames was churned into a muddy foam by steamers, and when the Clyde was umnavigable to aU save little coasters, Harwich was one of the most important harbours upon our Eastern coast. The opening which it commanded into the German Ocean during the long Contineatal war gave it an importance beyond its real merits. Harwich was, in fact, the only Eastern port on which we could rely for communicating with the North Sea and avoiding the almost insurmountable obstacles of contrary winds and tides in the river Thames; but since that time, and in exact proportion with the increase of our steam marine, Harwich as a port of embarcation for the Continent has fallen off. Why it has sunk so very low it would, perhaps, be difficult to say; its being a close borough, and having possibly depended for support on other influences beyond the fair exertions of its own inhabitants, may have done much, and the short sea route to the continent vii Dover and Ostend has done much more. But, whatever the cause, the fact remains that Harwich, as an outlet to the Continent, has utterly declined in public estimation. Attempts have been made to re-establish the old line without success. Another effort in the same direction is about to be made, and the London, Harwich, and Continental Steam Packet Company has been formed for the purpose, and to press upon the notice of the public the advantages which Harwich is said to possess as affording the shortest route to the Continent, especially to Berlin, Viemna, and Trieste.
With this end in view a number of the directors and others interested in the success of the scheme took au experimental trip to Rotterdam vid Harwich, in order to go over the ground, or rather the water, and adjust matters finally on the other side of the Channel. A special train was provided at Shoreditch on Friday evening last, to convey the party to Harwich. A little haziness appeared to pervade the minds of some of those arriving at the station as to what was to be the next step, but with the spirit of rashness naturally engendered by association with a new company they eventually hurried into the train and resigned themselves to the mercy of the directors. The distance from London to Harwich was accomplished easily within two hours. The London-a steamer belcnging to the Harwich and Dieppe line-was retained for the passage across. She is a very fine boat, fitted up like a yacht, with ample passenger accommodation, a light draught of water, and great speed; dry even in a cross sea, and steady as a house. As she was fixed to start at 6 a.m. on the following morning, there were not wantinog those who, under the shallow pretence of gratifying their nautical propensities, went at once on board, in the hope, as sailors say, of " resting their eyelids" till she was well to sea. But in thi
they were lamentably deceived. Hotel accommodation PJwas provided on shore, and such as went on board had to extemporize most impracticable beds from railway rugs and similar crude materials. Six o'clock a.m. on Saturday came, but the London, nevertheless, did not start. A thick white mist, something between a fog and a shower, hung heavily over land and sea, concealing objects even close at hand, and forming as impenetrable a barrier to a fast passage as a wall. But it was evidently only a temporary obstacle, so a short delay was determined on, and at 9 o'clock, the weather having cleared, the route to Holiand was continued under the most favourable auspices. The sea was like a mirror, and the London sped her course across it at the rate of 12 knots an hour. Passengers were congratulating themselves on being soon at their journey's end when, as the vessel neared the damp mist which denoted the approach to the Dutch coast, the old pilot from out his accumulation of overcoats hazarded discouraging conjectures as to the depth of water on the Brill Sands. Once unhappily combated in that opinion, and it immediately became his creed. Remonstrance or entreaty was futile. Pilots are more imperative than either kinos or rhymes, and so the London was forthwith anchored at about a mile from the Brill, and some 20 or thereabouts from Rotterdam.
There was another dreadful night of impromptu beds, the hardships of which were further aggravated by increased numbers and diminished resources; but all were merry, or, if not, at least resigned. Early on Sanday the Sand was crossed, and in another hour the vessel was well up the Maas, with the country which "draws 20 feet of water" stretching below at each side, and forcibly reminding the chilled spectator of the aspect of the scenery at the mouth of the Danube during winter. This association was rendered still more striking by the grisly-looking remains of three vessels recently wrecked, and whose gaunt ribs and spars protruding above the muddy water suggested to the timid most unpleasant ideas in connexionwith wintertrips. IRotterdam was gained at 10 o'clock, and the secretary for the company immediately started on his mission to Berlin, leaving general visitors to wander at will among the canals and ditches of Holland; to lose theniselves by taking swing bridges as landmarks; or by relying upon the aspect of any particular piece of water as a guide back to their hotel. On Monday evening the secretary quitted Berlin at 6 o'clock, and travelling, as we were informed, the last stage from Oberhausen per special train, arrived at Rot terdam on Tuesday morning at 10 30, and at 11 o'clock the London started on her return home. Again there was but shallow water either in the river or on the Briil, which, of course, necessitated almost half speed ; but before 1 o'clock she was well clear of both, stretching forward rapidly over a sea without even a ripple to break its glassy surface. Till near 5 in the evening the water flew from under her at the rate of more than 12 knots an lhour; but as the night fell an easy, smootb, monotonous swell arose, whilch made the good ship "lively," though its effect upon one or two of the passengers was by no means similar; and soon after 10 on Tuesday night the harbour of Hiarwich was fairly gained.
The special train up from Harwich made a smart passage of little more than two hours, so that the secretary accomphshed his through journey from Berlin to London in 32 hours. The land route by which the company propose to effect such changes in the speed of continental travelling is to reach Berlin by the Dutch Rhenish line to Oberhausen, and so avoid the curve made by the present Belgian route and its pasage of the Rhine at Cologne. By this a saving of about 100 miles is eflected, but to get to Rotterdam a rather long and disagreeable sea passage is necessary. Their proposed line of communication from this capital to Vienna and Trieste is by the same line as far as Oberhausen, and so on by Cassel, Leipsic, Dresden, Prague, and Vienua-a distance in all of 1,099 miles; and they hope to be able to achieve the whole line from London to Trieste,-a distance of 1,270 miles,-in from 42 to 44 hours. Viti Dover and Ostend to Vienna is 1,209 miles, and can be accomplished in 59 hours 30 minutes; or, from London to Trieste, 1,572 miles, in 83 hours 45 minutes. The saving of distance which the Harwich Company effect on the whole route is 300 miles in comparison with that by Dover and Ostend; yet they assert themselves capable of saving just half the present time. They have apparently based all their calculations on being able to proceed at an average speed of 30 miles an hour, including the long sea passage from Harwich to Holland. We hope they may accomplish this, but we confess we cannot
see now. Whoever has had to travel a long distance across the Continent need not be told that an esti-
mate of one's progress as being made at the rate of 30 miles an hour for 1,270 miles only befits the imagination of a young traveller or the prospectus of a newa company. That the Harwich Conmpany show a shorter route from Rotterdam is evident; bat to gain the starting point on the Dutch coast a sea trip of upwards of 120 miles is necessary; and this, in our humble judgment, begs the whole question as to speed. .In summer, under favourable circumstances, the run across may average as low as 10 or 12 hours. In winter, a!nid fogs and rough weather, when the dangerous passage through the Brill Sands cannot be attempted, but the vessels must go round by Helvoeilays,
through the Voorn Canal, the average of the trips
will be very considerably higher. On the whole, then, and after a careful comparison of the two routes, we believe that the result of a year's experienee will show that the Harwich route to the great towvns of the Continent will effect no saving in poltt of time, in consequence of the mncertainty of the zea passage ;but the saving in distance will be suffiriently considerable to enable the cormpany to ake hoth goods ana passengers at a low scale of faw. Whether these sources will
realize the very a.nxguine expectatiQns of the C9;Mpany we cauuot pretend to say.
The Double Murder At Walworth.
i THE DOUBLE MURDER AT WALWORTI.
Yesterday Thomas Fuller Bacon and Martha Bacon, his wife, tharged with the wilful murder of their two children, I were again brought up from Horsemonger-lane Gaol for
further examination beZore Mr. ELUoTT. At half-past 1 o'clock they were taken into court, which long before was crowded to excess, and the morbid feeling to get a sight particularly of the male prisoner seems so intense that the number of persons in attendance appears to increase with each succeeding examination. The countenanoe of Bacon seemed to undergo a change on entering the dock.
Mr. Woodward, the solicitor, attended on behalf of Bacon; and Mr. Crouch, from the office of Messrs. Wright and Bonner, appeared for Mrs. Bacon.
The first witness called was Mr. William Astle, a clerk at the London and Westminster Bank, who deposed that on the 18th of November Lst he paid a draught from the Northamptonshire Banking Company at Stamford for 301. He paid it in fonr notes of 5l. each, numbers 28,451 to 28,454, dated the 11th of October, 1856, and 10 Boverees
Mr. Richard A. Bailey, a clerk in the Bank of Enfnd said-I produce the four notes spoken to by the las witness. T wo of them were paid in on the 20th of November last, one on the 21st of the same month, and the fourth on the 29th of January. On the back of the last is the name of Bacon, Margaret-terrace. I also produce a fifth note, No. 46,815, dated July 12, 1856, for 51., and on the bhack of that is she nanie of "Weiland," and also the name of "Bacon," with parts of the initials, which have heen partly cut out in the process of cancelling, and the letters "gate," part of another word which has also been cut out. That note was paid in on the 30th of December last.
Mr. Edward Bacon, a respectable.looking man, the prisoner's brother, said, the name of "Bacon, Margaretterrace," on the note produced was in his wife's hardwriting, and he (witness) had no doubt that the note was one that had been paid to him by his brother, the male prisoner, on the 20th of November last.
Mr. Edward Charles Wendover. assistant to the Messrs. Chambers, ironmongers, 41, Bishopsgate-street without, deposed that he knew the prisoner, Thomas Bacon, very well, and that on the 24th of last December he came to his employers' shop to buy a chaff-knife, for which he paid with a 51.-note, and wrote his name on the back of it. The note now produced, No. 46,81O, is the same. Coming from the same part of the country as the prisoner, and knowing him well, he got into conversation with him, and the pnsoner told him he was living at Reigate. He (witness) asked him if Ihis wife was down there with him, and the prisoner replied that she was,
Mr. Charles Dixon, a tailor, at Stamford, said,-I have known the prisoner Bacon for 20 years or more, and have been in the habit of making clothes for him during that time. He used to live at Stamford, but left that place about four months ago. On Sunday, the 4th of Janury last, the ?risoner canme to Stamford, and on that day I saw him at the nouse of a Mrs. Scholes. He then asked me if I would repair his trousers, which he said he had torn by accident, and I did so. While doing it he asked meif I recollected making a greatcoat and other things for him a long time back, hut I told him I never recollected having made a greatcoat for him at all. Be then said, "You must recollect it, it was a sort of rough coat." I replied that I could not call it to mind, upon which he said, "You will be sure to be called about those clothes-a greatcoat and a suit of clothes, which were stolen from my house on the day of the murder, with 71. in money, and swatch He repeated several times that I shouldjbecalledon aboutthem I saw him again orn the same evenng on the platform at the railway station, ashe was going to London by the train, and he then said, "You will 4o what I ask you. It w bill e doing me agreat kindness,and will doyouno harm." Shaking hands with me he said, " You will do so, and say nothing to any one." What he wanted me to do was to say I had made the clothes that had been stolen. He said, "If they find the clothes there will be no marks about them to swear they belong to me."1
M<r. ELLIOrr.-Have you ever made a greatcoat for him? W.Vitness-No, Sir; *I never did.
3ir. ELuor.-How did the prisoner seem? What was sus annr ven hisconershontook place ?
Witney ss,dflei appeared in a v e , and could MTr. ELusOvr.-Did anything else take place ?
WXtnesWell, he showed me the picture of the two children, and said, " Who would ever think that my wife could murder two dear children like these?' and I said, "No, I will not believe it." He then said, "I believe some one came in at the door and committed the act."
Mr. ELLioTT.-Did the prisoner tell yoa what he came to Stamford for?
Witness.-No, Sir, he did not,
C,ross-examined by Mr. Woodward,- You say you have known the prisoner Bacon for upwvards of 20 years. I sup. pcose you have, made a great many clothes for him in that
Mlr. Dixon.-Yes, I have.
Mr. Woodward.-Then, how can you undertake to swear that you have not made a greatcoat for him?
Mr. Dixon.-I can and do undertake to say so.
Mr. Woodward.-Now, what did you suppose the prisoner to near by saying, " If you will do what I ask it will be doing me a great kindness and do you no harm?"
Mr. Dixon.-I think he intended me to swear that I had made him a greatcoat, though I had not, and though he did not exactly say so, that was the impression it made on my mind.
Other witnesses were In attendance, and it had been the intention of Mr. Elliott to conclude the case on that day, and to commit both the prisoners for trial, but this was trevented by the attendance of Mr. Hodgson, from the of ce of the Solicitor to the Treasury, who pronounced it as his opinion that it would be wholly impossble to prepare the caue for trial at the Old Bailey next session, and expressed a wish that a remand might take place, so as carry the proce.edings over to the April session at the Central Cinminal Court.
MIr. ELuoTr, under the circumstances, directed that the prisoners should stand remanded until this day (Thursday) week (the longest period he could legally rem and them t) when they should be brought up aso a matter of form and be again remanded to the Wednesday following, when the case, as he hoped, would be completed, and the prisoners com-
The prisoners were then removed, and the court in five minutes became perfectly deserted.
Smallpox And Vaccination.
SMAftLLPOX AND YAOCINATXIOX.
TO TaE EDITOR OF TEfE TIMES.
Sir,-The importance and interest of this subject to the public will perhaps excuse my adding a few words in corroboration of the remarks of Mr. Marson (February 12), when replying to the statements of the Rev. J. Hughes.
In the district alluded to (Looe, Cornwall), of which Mr. Hughes has the spiritual charge, smallpox has prevailed, it appears, to a very considerable extent, so that out of a population of 1,700 there have occurred during the last quarter seven deaths fromthis disease; in all t o fatal cases, and in the larger number of cases not fatal, vaccination seems to have been neglected. But that some of the vaccinated should suffer from smallpox, although without a fatal result, when the poison was so intensified by the great prevalence induced by neglect of vaccination, is surely no more than might have been exmeted. Dr. Jenner did not state that the protection was infallible, although it has proved to beo nearly so for at least the first eight years of life ; and we have yet to learn whie. ther the ca'es of smallpox after vaccination to which Mr. Hughes alludes 'were more than few, in which " the indications which are usuaUy considered to denote success"' as regards vaccination, were the four or more well-formed vesicles, leaving in due time dotted cicatrices, which characters have been proved by Mr. Marson, in his very valuable paper on this subject, to be the only sufficient evidence "that vaccination has done its work completely as a preventive of smallpox." In the district inwhichmy experience on this suhject has been gained during the last 17 years there ale upwards of 20,000 persons, and there has not been a single fatal case of smallpox for more than a year and a-half. Thetotalnumberofdeaths fromthis disease during the 17 years ending December, 1854, was 38, half of which number occurred in the first year and a-half (1837-38), the remaining 4 cases in the succeeding 16 years. In two cases only out of the 68 was the disease stated to have occuried after vaccination. Now, it is impossible to believe that a mortality which has never since 1838 exceeded si
cases annually, and the yearly average of which is little more than two, although smallpox has prevailed epidemi. cattUiri London durng the timke, in 1844,1848, and 18.51 can be satisfactorily accounted for in any otber way than by the more general adoption of vaccination. The deaths from smallpox at the commencement of the last century exceeded 1-12th of the whole number; had it been in this district as fat.l now, we should have had instead of two about 28 deaths from this cause annually; consequently we may probably correctly ascribe the saving of not less than 400 lives to vaccination in this district alone during the period above mentioned. One word on the difficult subject of carrying out this invaluable discovery so as to secure its full benefit to the public.
The compulsory character of the Act has been much misrepresented as a forcible interference with whatis called the independence of Englishmen and the discretionary power of parents. But surely aU law is an infringement of personal freedom for the sake of the general good, and that this is greatly affected by the -imitation of smallpox does not admit of question. The State cannot allow that children should be permitted to die because ignorant parents will not avail themselves on their behalf of asafe and easy preventive measure, much les canit admit the lives of others to be jeopardized by this neglect. Nor is the operation of a compulsory law superfluous, even as regards many of the better informed, as it fixes a time within which an operation they feel desirable should be performed, and which, probably, a mother's dread of having a slight pai inndicted on her infant might inducs her to defer perhaps indefinitely. Let the lav and the general good sense of the community go together. Let a smaU fine be imposed in case of continued neglect, and be enforced in the more aggravated oases at the instance of the inspector of nuisnices.
As snore correct information respecting vaccination is disseminated, andi it is considered one of those " common things" with the truth and value of which all people should be made familiar, unfounded prejudices will disappear, and there 'will be very little difficulty in carrying it into more extensive operation. "For thoese who cannot be forced ought to be taught, and ought to be invited to mteetings and friendly assemblies." It will then be understood that the practice originated by our great countryman is ordinpaRly free from danger-at least, I have not met with a casowhich presented any in 17 years, that It possesses pro)ably even greater power in lessening the spread of smallp,ox than it does in completely protecting every individsl person. Wernaythen conclude with a dstinguish"d living physician that " without disseminating (as is the ucse with inoculation) a dangerous or deadly poison, if ng otly used, it affords the means of eradicating from.a well. ngsslated communoity, or, *tleast, of confining ilthin narroa limits, tbe most loathsome pestilenet which the eqrld has known."!

Sir,-In The Times of Monday, at page 12, colamn 1, you gave au account of Mr. Jeffree's smoke-constnmig apparatus, as applied on board Her Majesty's steamship Vivid, and at the end of the paragraph you say, " This is the first experiment which has been attempted on board any of Her Majesty's steamers." Now, this is a mistake which I hope you will have the goodness to correct; for the fact is that I applied my smoke-consuming farnaces on board Her Majesty's steamships Megmra, blsck Eagle, and Shearwater according to my two earliest patents, and they gave much satisfaction to the Admiralty, of which they sent me written testimonials; and on the Sth of August, 1855, 1 wrote to them offering to apply my fornaces, as perfected by my last patent-i.e., of the 10th of Auzt, 1S53, t my own expense and risk, by which they are brought to such perfection that they effect a saving of rather more than 50 per cent. of coal, and consume the smoke of that of the most bituminous kind so perfectly that no more arises from it than from a fire of the best coke.
I am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.

THE CRIMEAN COMMISSIONERS.-At the meeting of
Tin CRn=n COaarrssioN Bs.-At the meetino of the Edinburgh Town Conncil on Tuesday the Lord Provost moved, "1 that the Council resolve to present a petition to the House of Commons, praying them to take measures for marking the sense which the public entertain of the important services rendered to the country by Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch, in their inquiry into the causes of the disasters that befel ourtroops in the Crimea, and in the valuable report submitted by them to Government." His Lordship remarked that the zeal, intelligence, ability, and intrepidity displayed by the commissioners in the Crimea had been universallyacknowledged and appreciated throughout the centry, while their services had been most beneficial to the army, and what they had to request of their representatives in Parliament was that they should take some steps whereby the names of the commissioners should go dovn to posterity as benefactors of their country, and that they should show that *uch labours and servccs as theirs would always command the gratitude of their fellow.

Taxes On Knowledge.
TAXES ON KNOWLEDGE. I
The sixthannualmeeting of the AssociationforPromoting the Rtepeal of the Taxes on Knowledge was held yesterday eveng t St.Martin's-hall. There was a very large attend ance both in the body of the hall and on the platform.
Sir J. FAXTON, MBP., having taken the chair, opened the proceedings by obeerving that previous to the assembling of Parhament he had hoped that the meeting that night would only have been a formal one, to congratulate them. stlves on the Chancellor of the Exchequer having promised to repeal that most odious of all taxes, the tax on paper. But he grieved to say that he feared from what had trans. pired that this would not betheir last meeting on the subject, the ChanceDor of the Exhequer in his financial statement having held out no hope that the paper-tax would be repealed. On the contrary, judging fronithe whole tenour of his speech, aDd from what he said in relation to it, one was induced to btlieve that the right hon. gentleman was rather in favonr of the tax than otherwise; for what did he say? After stating that the tax divided itself into three heads-namely, a tax on paper for printing, on paper for writing, and on pper for packages, ae *dded that, while he coneidered the
uty ratber heavy on the third description of paper, he thoueht the tax on the other two descriptions could not be said to be a tax on knowledge, and in his opinion paper itself was a fair subject for taxation. It was therefore quite evident that the present Chancellor of the Exchequer was determined to retain the tax, ,t all events for the present. Had Mr. Gladstone remained in power he thought that right hon. gentleman would have repealed the tax before now. In 1853 Mr. Gladstone denounced the paper duty, and said he should bo delighted to see the day when it could be repealed. Mr. Disraeli, too, in 1851, when he was not in power, spoke strongly against the tax; but in 1852, when he came into office he somewhat altered his tone. A deputation from the society waited upon the ChanceUor of the Exchequer some little time since, when that right hon. gentleman made certain inquiries and drew certain deductions which evidently showed that he pcssessed a very slight acquaintance with the aubject. He asked the deputation whether they believed if the duty on paper were remitted there would be a perceptible change in the price of books, and on being told there would, he asked to what extent, and Aldernman Baldwin stated that the duty enhanced the price on the first books used at schools 30 per cent. ; and observed thlatthetax fell on the manufactnrer in the first instance, andthat he did not get any profit ontheilduty paid. Upon this the right hon. gentleman asked whether fr. Baldwin thought the manufacturer ought to make a profit on the duty he paid? This was rather a strange question for a Chancellor of the Exchequer to put to a manufacturer. Why, it had been shown over and over again that this tax in many instances amounted to 100 per cent, on the cost of the article; if, therefore, the manufacturer had to pay 100 per ceqt. duty, that was as much a charge upon his paper bfore st got into the market as the gas on his premises, or any otherarticle involved in the cost of production. BLit the evil did not stop there, for there mnst be a profit realized by each person through whose hands the paper passed froni the manufacturer to the consumer, and thus the tax was increased by means of tuese several charges of profit to perhaps 200 per cent. By way of showing how benencially the repeal of an Excise duty operated, the hon. chairnian referred to the manufacture of glass, in which great improvements bad been made since the removal of the Exicise restrictions, and stated that the glass for the original Crystal Palace cost 13,5001., whereas if the duty bad remained unrepealed the cost would have been 5,,O0. If, therefore, the tax on glass had continued the people would never have had a Crystal Palace. The Chancelior of the Exchequer had gone back to an old-exploded school for hiis system of taxation, and had raked up a gentleman who wrote nearly a century ago-Mr. Arthur Younn-who said that the best tax that could be imposed was a little taxupon a great number of things. But, after what they had seen done by Sir Robert Peel, he thonght the fact that a ChanceUor of the Exchequer of the present day should lay down such an exploded doctrine was no proof that they were improving and becoming a more enlightened governing nation. (Cheers.) After pointing out the great maischief which Excuse restrictions wrought, by checking all improvement in the manufacture of the article subject to duty, the chairman concluded by observing that as long as a tax on paper remained it was idle and a delusion upon the public for gentlemen who advocated the education of the people and the institntion of reformatories to endeavour to effect their objects. It could not be done without first removing that most objectionable tax. (Cheers.)
Dr. EPPs then came forward, and moved the following resolution
*'Tb3tthec e Ex3en ODaper limits its suppl ans enbances its ie,

o and labour, and thus leds t0 produco psuperi,m
*D ce and tha: the interest oft he coonery ImpeatIvely demands thatniess iruziuonsmno.e of raising money be resortedtothauatax OD so smportant a manufacture."
The present pper duty was 11d. per lb., and 5 per cent. additional. Te tax, if on books, was most unfair to authors, and if on cheap publications, particularly on newspapers, it was most injurious to the public. If they took a daily paper weighing 14 to the pound sposiug its circulation to be 20,00ji, that would give 6,26, 0e copies a-year equal to 447,1421b., or as nearly as possible 202 tons, which, at 141. 14s. per ton, gave an annual tax of 2,9401. It was said that the penny papers were not worth more than a penny; but who made them not worth more than a penny? tbnhat 2,9401. was left in the hands of the proprietors they could employ men of greater ability on their papers. The tax was an interference with the progress of socGety, and it materially retarded the manufacture. When the dut.y was reduced from 3d. to I'd. a great increase in the manufacture of paper took place; but that was in some degree checked by the additional tax of 3-10ths of a farthing imposed in 1853. The liberties of the people essontiaUy depended on free discussion, but there never could be free discussion where there was not a free press, and an entirely free press could not be enjoyed while this obnoxious tax on paper was suffered to esist. (Cheers.)
Dr. JOHN WATrS seconded the resolution. He said that one evil resulting from the tax on papet was to render the trade a complete monopol;r. Men of small capital could not embark-in it. If asimilarimpostwere attempted to be levied on anyother branch of trade ithe kingdom everyindividual in that trade would be converted into a rebel. (Cheers.) After describing the vexatious workings of the Excise laws and pointing out the frauds that were practised by the sanction of the Government in carrying out those laws, the speaker observed that by the payment being exacted within six weeks after it had accrued due many persons were actually ruined. When a person got into difficulties with the Excise, and could not pay the duty at the proper time, the debt immediately became doubled. In regard to the Customs the law was different. Merchants were allowed to keep their goods in bond until they conld seld thema, before paying the duty. The policy of the Government in exacting this duty was most mischievous - and for the sake of obtaining a revenue of one million they prevented the creation of two millions of wealth. (Cheers.) Why should notEngand supply the whole worldwith paperaswellaswith cotton. The people worked harder than those of any other nation, and our m achinery was better. But for this tax England might just as well supply the world with paper as she did now vwith calicoes. (Cheers.) But the yield of paper was decreasing, while the yearly increase of calico was immense. It was said that the tax brought a million a year to the revenue, but Mr. Gladstone told the House of Commons the other night that, although 22,000,0001. of taxes had been repealed, yet the revenue had not suffered a single penny; and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who did not propose to repeal this tax, must be blind indeed to tho best interests of the country. (Cheers.)
Mr. H. INGoRAM, BLP., supported the resolution. He was perfectly disintere,ted on the question. He admitted the evils that arose from the paper duty. He once was ambitious to have a large book trade and to publish educational works, but he was obliged to give up a very large trade because it was a positive loss to him. (Cheers.) It had been said, what benefit would the repeal of the tax be to the consuimer ?-the daty on leather was taken off, and yet shoes and boots were not cheaper. There was a limit to the supply of skins; but that remark would not apply to the production of paper. No country in the world, save England, imposed a paper duty. England stood alone. The Chinese, who invented paper, might well call us outside barbarians. (Cheers and laughter.) Tho paper trade was sensibly diminishing in this country. In the United States of America there were 750 paper mills, producing 270,000.0001b. of paper a-year. In England the production of paper w 1 166,000,0001o., only 155,000,OOOlb. of which were for houme consumption. Considering the vast quantity of paper used by the Government themselves, and the aUnommt of drawback allowed for bibles and testaments, he did not believe that the tax yielded so much as 1,000,000( a-year. The drawback allowed for bibles and testaments alone amoanted to 22,3511. in two years. The hon. member concluded by saying that he could support the resolIti , because he considered it to be a tax on the education, the industry, and the intelligence of the country. (Cheers.)
The resolution was put and carried unanimously.
Air. Serjeant PAIRRT then mored the following resolution 1
" That the tax on paper Is a tax on knowledge, which, by destroying the author's tund. deteriorates cheep llter_auco, and checks the euter.
pte oo tthoeb,Vt publishers. That It ought, theeore, to be immedi-
atelyrepealed."
Mr. HxLc. seconded the resolution, which was also unanimously agreed to.
Mr.I MILNER GIBSON, I.?P., then came forward and was received with repeated rounds of cheers. He proposed a vote of thanks to Sir J. Paxton for his kindness in presiding over the meeting. The sympathies of that gentleman had al-ways been withthe cause oE the industrial classes, and those sympathies w^ere never better evinced than by his appearing that evening ame^g them. (Cheers.) It bad been his (^r. Gibson's) lot to visit various Mlinisters of State, aul he h^^d conversed wvith them on the asia-
chievous oprtior, of rn Excise duty on paper. He had generally been received courteously, and had heard no
argument in favour of tke duty, but had been bowed o%b in a plesant sort of manner. (Cheers and laughter.) In Set, ti the present Chancellor of the Exchequer they ha not of late years had any Minister of State who had the- boldness to avow himself a friend to the tax on its own merits. All the rAt hbad said that possibly there were objpctions to the duty, but that that was not the time to deab witl so sarge an item of revenue. (Cheers and laugbier.)j The question they ad to consider was, how were they to ea. complish the repeal of the ab r duty? h was the obvious and bounden duty of that society sat to case from its eSozts until that duty was repea3e. (CheGrs,) In the commeneement of this agtation they propoed three principal objects-the repeal of the advertisement duty, the repeal of tme stamp duty on newpapers, ad the nepo of the duty on paper. They were supporteA by xmciptocs for ffeotingesense three objects. They had s eeded in obtaining the first two objects, and thae would sot be dis. cbar4ing the engagement they undertook smal Oe perseTered in their effortt until they suoseeded im efthog the abolition of the paperduty. (Cheers.) He,fora,eooperated with the sooiety in the first ins*nce, beeas. h was -,, advocate of a free press; but tey coud mot bave a toee

Thejournals of Parllmsat pxsed that V.'e Inten. tion of imposiga duty wo prceene~irnlatit, nof cheap newspapers sinl to chteek the-diffesiax of l°knoWedge among thepeople.

bis authority. In 1711 a message was sent by Queet Anne, complaining of the scurrilous libels wbich were being published adalnst Her Majesty's Government, and calling upon the H6ise of Commons to find a remedy equal to the mischief. WillF Parliament talked of a censorship, and rd other pl:nsfor restraining the press. At last some member bliuted that perhapsa tax might accomplish the same end, and not bear the odious name of censorship; so they agreed to impose three heavy taxes upon the press. What they were afraid of was cheapness and universality, lest the People should become-.live to the misdoinga of theirGovernnent. (Cheers.) The Government of the present day said that it might be desirable to relieve the country from this tax, but the state ofthe revenue did not admit of it. A Ministry had two points to consider,-first, bow much money they must raise nd next how they were to raise it It was not enough to axy that a particular mode of taxation would give a certain amount of revenue if it could be shown that that mode was far more injurious to the State than advantageous to the revenue. He believed the tax on paper praduced more pernicious influence on society than the benefit it gave to the Govermuent by the money it produced. (Cheers.) He did not know that if. the duty were repealed it would be miseed. When the Ecise duty on glaFs was repealed it was not missed, and for a very obvious reason-where there was a number of diferent taxes one tax strved the other; but if they repealed a tax upon some one article of consumption, there was more money left to he spent on other articles, which made up for the repeal of any particular duty.. (Cheers.) When they heard of pauperism and crime prevailing, and that great efforts should be made to provide for the spiritual destitution of the people, and tracts. should be circulated, he Would say that the first thirig to be done was to remove those obstacles that stood in the way of improving the people's minds; and when they talked of increasing the wealth of tlVe country, let it be diffused antong the labourers of the country, and they would thereby do more to putdown pauperm and crime thanaU thepreaching in the world. (Cheersj In advocating a chkeap press it must not be imaned that they were opposedto the existing press. His argument had always been that there was room enough for both. He believed they had accomplished a great public good so far as they had gone by repealing the stamp and advertissmeut duty, but their efforts could not be crowned with success unless they added to that achievement the repeal of the paper duty.

Sir,-Your Limerick correspondent of the 20th inst. on this subject, observes, as a means of preventinr the introduction of the disease into this country, "It is only necessary to lay an embargo on live cattle and raw hides, the produoe of countries where this disease has already appeared."
I beg to inform your correspondent on this bead that in the colony of the Cape of Good Hope for the last three years more than one-balf the horned cattle have died of this plague, which is there called the lung sickness, and their hides have been invariably imported into this country ina raw state.
I do not see why, however good the policy may be of laying an embargo on the importation of cattle, the prohibition should extend to raw hides, since,hadthe disease beent contagious from this cause, it would have mode its appearance before this.

BURGLARIES IN YORKSHIRE.-The York papers
BURGLARIES IN YORKscrsxg.-The York papers state that, notwithstanding the recent captuze of a whole gang of burglars in that county, a series of nocttrnal robberies 'were again committed in the North Riding last week. On Wednesday night the house of Mr. J. W. Drinkrow, farmer, Tibthorpe, near Driftield, was entered through a window by a party of thieves, who had succeeded in packing up a great variety of plunder, but were prevented from carryium it offby the arrival home at a late hour of one of the servants employed on the premises. They left a. bludgeon bebind them. On the same night attempts weremade to break into three different houses at Middleton. On Friday nght the house of Mr. W. Binnington, of North Dalton W old, was er'tered through a vwindow by burglars, wbo took away 1501. worth of silver plate without disturbing tho famuily. A man who has been recognized as an old', ofender, and who had in his pockot a dessert fork with a. carved ivory handle, identified as part of the stolen property, is now in custody on a charge of being concerned in. the robbery.
FATAL FiRE.-On Saturday morning, about 1L o'clock, a fire broke out in a portion of a mill at Kirkheaton, near Huddersfield, known as Levi's mill and,the propert; of Mr. Sheard, of Huddersfield. While a man of weak. intellect named William Suith was willowing cotton and wool together, in the teaser, or willow room, the friction of the machinery ignited the cotton. Smith drew the burning cotton ont of the machine and threw it upon a mass of wool and cotton lying by, which was thus ited. The flames spread with great rapidity, and, before they could be extinguished, damage to the extent of about 2,OGOl. was done. The charred and burnt body of Smith veas afterwards found, crouched behind some oil-casks. Aninquest was held upon the remains of the unfortunate man, and a verdict of "Accidental Death" was returned.
MnRoPLTAx. w- DKAi) -t t MARKLT.-Yesterday a conference took place at Guildhall upon the sestion of appropriating the present site of Smithfield or some part thereof as a metropolitan dead-meat market. Mr. W.L Taylor, Chairnan of the Markets Improvement Committee, presided, and there were present a large number of the n'embers of the conmittee and of the inhabitants and supporters of the memorial in favour of the pro.ct. The memorial having been read several gentlemen made statements. in support of it. Mlr. Scannell, one of the churchwardens. of the parish of St. Sepulchre, bore testimonyto the amount of distress which had been caused througa the removal of Smithfield-m%rket, and the consequent abs:>ction of trade from that spot. After similar statementsc from other gpntlemen,. Mr. Lardner, the Chairman of the Smithfield, Appropriation Committee, contended for the necessity forsome steps being taken for the establisbment of a central dead-meat market on the site of Smitlxipld,-first, on the ground of the-inconvenience of the pres=ntNewgate market, and, secondly, Sronm the fact that tie existingusappropi Sed spaee was giving, facilities for parsons hoding publi. meetings there. which had a tendency Iq create tuults and! drive away many respectable personafrom the: neighbourboed.

(FROM OUR OWN CORRFSPONDNW.)
PARIS, TUESDAY, FB. 24, 6 P.W.
The definitive settlement of the Persian quarrel hazs been so often announced and so often contradicted that it is right to speak of it with caution. It is, however, once more affirmed that there is every probability of an arrangement satisfactory to both parties. If I may credit the information that has reached me, matters have gone on so well -within the last day or two that a draught of a convention relating to the points in dispute has been this day sent off to London. Of this draught Colonel Ouseley is said to be the bearer. According to this account, the islands of Karrak and Ormuz will be ceded to the English, who will evacuate Bushire, while the Persians will, in turn, give up Herat. The dismissal of the Shah's Prinie Minister will not be insisted upon, nor also the other demand relative to the manner in which Mr. Murray is to be received at Teheran, and which was considered derogatory to the Shah's dignity. It is added that Persia has agreed to receive Consuls in those places where Russian Consuls are established. The information as to these various points is not of such a character as would justify me in positively affirming the exactness of each. What I have little hesitation, however, in stating is, the great probability of an arrangement. The draught of the convention has, of course, to be first submitted for the approbation of the English Government.
An equally satisfactory result is generally said to await the question of Neuchftel. I fear, however, this is, at all events, premature. That efforts have been made within the last few days to attain that end I am aware. At the last conference the Prussian Minister specified the terms on which his Go-
vernment would settle the matter, and Dr. Kern,! without giving any opinion, thought it his duty to i transmit them to Betne. Since then I have been 1 informed that the pretensions of the King of Prussia are, as I anticipated long since, of such a nature as to render their acceptance by the Sviss Government very difficult, unless (of which there is as-yet no sign) it is ready to give up most of the advantages for which it has hitherto so earnesly con-
tended. Contrary to what is generaly said, I l doubt if any considerable progress has been made in the way of a satisfactory arrangement.
The French Government is about to appoint a Consul at Bussorah in Asiatic Turkey. It is believed that the appointment wiM be given to M. Poucharra.
A letter from Rome, of the 19th instant, informs us that a more than usual number of strangers have visited that city this winter. They are calculated at 00,000, of whom one-half are Italians, and the remainder from other parts of the 'world. The King of Bavaria arrived at Rome on the afternooa of the 15th inst. His Majesty proposes to remain three weeks in Rome. It is said, further, that he wiU return by Athens, in order to visit his brother, King Otho.
It is reported that the Government has some intention of creating two new bishoprics in France. Since the last nominations, which provided for the vacant sees of Belley, Viviers, and St. Denis (Ile de la R6union), which, as well as Guadaloupe and its dependencies, were, until lately, admninistered by "Apostolic Prefects," the episcopal corps has been fixed as follows :-There arelg ecclesiasticalprovinces, governed by metropolitans or archbishops, namely, Aix, Albi, Avignon, Auch, Besancon, Bordeaux, Bourges, Cambrai, Lyons, Paris, Rheims, Rouen, Sens, Toulouse, and Tours. These l5 metropolitans have as suffragans 70 bishoprics, of which 65 are inthe French territory, and the remaining five in Corsica, Algiers, the Isle of Bourbon, Guadaloupe, and Martin,ique. Four of the last-mentioned are of recent creation, and the Bishopric of Laval, a suffraganof Tours, dates from the 30th of June, 1855. Of the 15 Archbishops now existing, eight were promoted to their present rank under the Government of Louis Philippe, namely, the Metropolitans of Besan2on, Lyons, Bourges, Albi, Bordeaux, Rheims, Sens, and Rouen; threecunder theRepublic, Avignon, Cambrai, and Toulouse; and four under the present Empire, Auch, Paris, Aix, and Tours.
Of the Bishops two only date from the Restoration,-Chalons-sur-Marne, elected in 1823, aud Vannes, in 1827.
Twenty-nine Bishops were named by Louis Philippe, viz. :-Marseilles, Gap, Ajaccio, Algiers, Cahors, Valence, Montpelier, Tarbes, Bayonne, Metz, Strasbourg, Verdun, Nancy, Agen, Perigueux, Clermont, Le Puy, Tulle, Dijon, Meaux, Versailles, Beauvais, Seez, Nevers, Soissons, Montauban, Angers, Rennes, and St. Brieux. Sixteen were named by the Republic, viz. :-Digue, Poitiers, Angouleme, Mende, Arras, Autun, Langres SaintClaude, Orleans, Blois, Moulins, Troyes, Nantes, Saint-Flour, Saint-Di6, and St. Pierre de Fort de France (Martinique). Twenty-three have been appointed under the present Empire, viz. :-Frejus, Rcdez, Perpignan, Nimes, La Rochelle, Lucon, Gr6noble, Chartres, Amiens, Bayeux, Evreux, Coutances, Pamiers, Carcassonne, Limoges, Viviers, Le Mans, Quimper, Aire, Laval, La Basse-Terre (Guadaloupe), and St. Denis (Isle of Bourbon).
Among these prelates the senior in respect of promotion to the prelacy is M. de Bonald, the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyons, who was named Bishop of Le Puy in 1822, and who filled that see till 1839, when he was raised to the archiepiscopal see of Lyons. Besides his episcopal seniority the see be governs stood highest in rank. In other times the Archbishop of Lyons-the creation of the see is referred to the 2d century-was styled Primate of Primates(Primos P(mFtum), and the first Bishop of the Churches of the Gauls. M. de Bonald is in his 70th year.
In respect of age the senior is M. de Prilly, Bishop of Chalons-sur-Marne. He was born in 1775, and is consequently in his 82d year. The career of this venerable prelate is somewhat out of the common line. On the 8th of February, 1807, the day of the battle of Eylau, the Emperor Napoleon, in order the better to ascertain the movements of the enemy, ascended to the summit of the church steeple, and thence swept the field with his telescope. After he had been a sbhort time on the look out from this observatory he all at once perceived a column of infantry,which was moving rapidly to the church in the belfry of which he had taken his position. Napoleon descended quickly, mounted his horse, and galloped to a French corps which was close at hand: it was the 16th Regiment of Dragoons, which filled a distinguished place in the annals of the Imperial army. "Look at that mass," he said to the colonel; " charge it home. The fate of the battle depends on your doing so." The men put spurs to their horses and dashed forward in the direction the Emperor pointed. The enemy, taken in flank, were in a short time broken, and sabred under the Emperor's eye. When the work was done, and the Dragoons were getting into order, Napoleon presented himself among them. The captain of the troop delite held a colour in his hand which had been taken from the Russians. " Captain," said the Emperor, " that flag is the best proof of your bravery; I give you the cross of the Legion of Honour." " The honour of the act is not mine, Sire," said the captain, bowing; " it belongs to Lieutenant D_-.." " No, Sire," said the lieutenant, " it was my captain who took the colour from the enemy, and it is he who merits the cross." " Well, wells IMessieurs, all I can say is that you are as niodest as you are brave," said the Emperor, smiling; "you shall both have the cross." The captain and his lieutenant contracted on that day a friendship which stiUl subsists in all its force.
ne captain was known to be of a serious character and of austere morals, and he was, like Bayard, without fear and without reproach; and the younger officers respected and feared him more than they did those of higher authority over them. At the peace of 1814 many officers renounced the military profession, and sought thefr fortumes in another career. The .aptain o'f Dragoons in question, under the influence of a call which he could not resist, entered the ecclesiastical seminary of Avig-
non. His friend, the lieutenant, remained with the amuy, rose to the rank of general ofricer, and married and settled in Versailles. The captain took orders, was named superior of the seminary, subse-
quently Vicar-General of the dioess, and is now the
Bishop of Chalons-sur-Mane, to which see he was appointed in 1824 by the Government of Louis *XYIII, Not many years ago the daughter of his
gld friend the lieutenant married a gentleman of Avallon, in the department of the Yonne, and the religious ceremony wa celebrated by the ci-denat Dragoon.
l;rey one speaks of the venerable prelate as a model of evangelical virtue. His income fronm the State-is 12,0000. (4801.), nearly the whole of which ii spent in works of charity. I at assured by one who has known him well and long that his per-
aonal expenses hardly exceed 2£. per day. Every hour of his time is devoted, even at his advanced age, to the duties of his offlice and to the comfort of the poor and afflieted. He sometimes talks of the great wars of the Empire, and it is easy to see that the military fire of the old Dragoon is not yet entirely extinct. He is an officer of the Legion of
Ionour, and one or two circumstances lead his friends to suspect that he is not unwilling it should be known that his decoration was won on the field of battle, and not elsewhere.

THE PERSIAN QUESTION.
The Nord of Brumels publishes the following, under date of Paris, 22d instant -
" I have only just time to add a few words to my despatch of yesterday, respecting the Anglo-Persian difficulty. As I telegraphed to you, that question is settled. You are aware that one of the claims advanced by Lord Stratford recently at Constantinople, and which Feruk Khan thought exorbitant, was a demand for the dismissal of the Prime sinister of the Shah, the Sadr' Azam, Mirzs Aga Apaan.
" Engiand has relinquished this demand. The Sadr 'Azam will remain in office.
" The second claim of England, upon which the London Cabinet strongly insisted, was still more exorbitant.
" The English Government desired that, on Mr. Murray, the British representative at Tehoran, resuming his office, he should receive twice the visits of the Persian authorities before returning them. This demand could not be complied with by the Shah. This also has been set aside. 3Ir. Murray will be received with all the honours due to his ran,k, but the Persian Govermment will xot have to perform an act which would have lowered it in the eyes of the people, and to the humiliation of which it never could have contsented.
"But Persia has consented to receive English Consuls in all the towns where there are Russian Consuls.
" Elerat will be restored on the one hand, and Bushire on the other.
" Such are the more important points which I have to communicate to you on a question which the English Goverrnment was very anxious to bring to a settlement.
" I think that I am the first to send you this news, and that you wil have it even before Lord Palmerston announces it to the House."
AUSTRIA.
(FROM OUR OWN OORRESPONDET.)
VIENNA, Fm 22.
WVhen their Majesties go to Hungary in May the whole Court will accompany them to PeBth. there will be a series of festivals in the capital of Hungary, and, after some little time has been spent in the Imperial residence at Budas, visits will be paid to the capitals of the different districts. It is certain that the Government is willing to make some concessions to the Hiungarians, but the latter are inclined to asik more than will be granted. The Hungarians complain bitteriy of heavy taxation and of the total want of economy in the administration of the revenue, but these are points on which they and their Sovereign are not likely to agree. The different provinces would fain have some control over the expenditure, but you may be sure that the provincial " represent3tions" will never be permitted to interfere with any matters of finance. They will probably be allowed to administer the so-called " provincial funds," but they will have neither the power to grant nor to withhold the supplies.
The new passport regulations are in the Wiener Zeitutn{ of this morning. The most remarkable changes are :-l. The passports of travellers will only be examined and vis6 on the frontiers. 2. If a foreigner should have neglected to obtain the visa of an Austrian Minister or Consul to his passport he will not, as has hitherto been the case, be sent back from the Austrian frontier, but will be furnished with a document by the frontier autborities which will enable him to reach his destination. 3. In future no foreigner will be obliged to pay a tax for an Aufexthas-Karte (permission of sojourn) in any Austrian city or town. 4. Austrian subjects will be furnished with a so-called Legitimations-Schein (document of identity), with which they wil be able to travel without let or hindrance from the Po to the Elbe, and from Semlin on the Danube to Bregenz on the Lake of Constance.
THE RUSSIAN RAILROAD SCHEsE.
(FROM OURJ BBRLIN oRRRSP0oDzN.)
BERLIN, Fan. 23
The engrossing topic of the press of St. Petersburg continues to be the recent ukase authorizing the formation of a joint-stock company for the construction of a network of railroads, and this, too, almost to the same extent as the reproduction of the ukase, the statutes, and the regulations had a few days before engrossed its space. In such articles as have as yet come into my hands the language and the ideas are by no means over-excited or unduly sanguine on the subject of the future railways, though nothing at present betrays that the Russians have any idea of the amount of distrust with which the invitation to invest money in such works is regarded not only in London but even here. Your City Article of last Saturday said very correctly of Berlin, " it may be regarded as the place where everything Russian is most truly appreciated;" and I can assure the gentlemen in St. Bartholomew'-lane, as regards this ihnes that if tmey feel the slightest inclination to invest money in Russian railway shares, they need only converse with the first well-informed man they may meet in the street here to be thoroughly dissuaded from their intention.
The remarks which the Russian press makes upon the railway scheme offer nothing new or unexpected. The order, however, in which they for the most part occur is characteristic of the national mind. The flirt remark generally refers to the language of the Imperial ukase, in which the Emperor expresses his " confidence in the blessing of the Most High," as worthy of the great undertaking that is thus recommended to the favour of the nation; the second generally expatiates on the extent of the prejudices and opposition against this "Western innovation," which still exist in the mass, of the people, to whom this method of communication is uknown, and whom there will be no means of convincing of its utility for ten years to come at least. Of the conditions mnder which the concession has been granted to the capitalists there is but one opinion,-viz., that they could not have been much more favourable to Russia,
inasmuch as the nation is in a fair way to obtain a network of railroads without any immediate outlay at all on its part, and, as is feebly put forward, perbaps without ever expending anything for them. It is maintained howrever, that the conditions are at the same time not unfavourable for the company, inasmuch as the latter may possibly realize considerable profits, and at the worst will receive interest at the rate of 43t per cent. (5 per cent., less Q per cent, for amortizationl). This is rather cool, considering that no Russian embarks in anything without an all but certainty of getting more than 8 per cent. for his money, which is the current rate of interest in the countiy. It is admitted, on the other hand, that the company undertakes afearful obligation in tying itself down to fixed periods for finishing the works, considering the numerous uuforeseen and inevitable hindrancesthat will certainlyspringup in the wayand hamper them in prosecuting their plans. This weak point in the affair the Russian writers generally gloss over with neatly turned and complimentary phrases about the skill of the company's engineers, their great industrial and intellectual powers, their zich store of experience already acquired, their high skill in the construction of machinery and engines, &c. To these fine phrases, and many others, about this railway scheme being an undeiiable evidene ofthefuturepacifipolicyof Russia, I callonly Say they allemai to b proved
while, of she ptriotmrand publ spirit on the per of his subjects, to which the Ezapetor appeals, it need not be doubtedl that They wil nianifest themselves at the right time, and that right time will, I
conceives be coincident with-the moment Ewhen the company bas spent all the funda it bas contrived to rakie, and in its inability to Iulet VWestern Europe n any further contributions iscompelledto make over to the Russian Government, on any terms, its still unfinished railways.
A recent statement of the working of the Petersburg and hloscow line during the rat year showed teat in the twelve months 962,198 persons had travelled by it; 23 pouds of goods bad been conveyed by it; the receipts amounted to 6,500,000 roubles silver, and, if the charges for forwarding troops and the mail were included, 7,500,000. These receipts avera-ed per day 20.500, and per verste 12.422 roubles silver. This is the result of the working of a line between the two capitals of au empire of 60,000,000 of people during a year, which was signalized by a coronation and enormous popular festivities at the less important of the two capitals, so that all who took a part in the Moscow ceremonial festivities or preparations, whether comaing from St. Petersburg or from foreign countries, were necessarily conveyed along the line at least twice.
A regulation that was published in the Journal oE the Senate last January shows that the Russiau Gvovernment is determined to convert the construetion of the Russian railroads by foreigners, in addition to all other advantages Russia is to reap froma it, into a school for educating its own engineers in
the art and mystery of earthworks, tunnels, gra-| dients, curves, culverbs, sidings, &c. By this
regulation the chief director of ways and corn- I munications is empowered, on the application of private companies occupied in the construction of railroads or other important pu-blic works, to permit offlcers of the Imperial En.gineer Corps to take Part in those laboursa These officers or other technical erpZoyds of the Goverament wil not be required to renounce the Government service on account of their assisting in a private enterprise of this nature; on the contrary, the time they thus pass will be reckoned as though passed in the service; they will also receive halfpay and retain the military servant that each is entitled to as officer, and in case of their showing skill or meritorious conduct they wil be entitled t' look forward to honorary distinctions on the part of the Government. What they may be able to obtain for the services they may render to their private employers will be their own, to retain; after three years they will, for the most part, return to their former posts, but individual officers will be allowed to prolong their contracts on the special ape plication Of the company. In this way, by procuring every three years a fresh batch of its officers to be taken into the service and pay of skilled engineers from foreign parts, the Government will procure a good proaesszonal education for its own servants and lighten its own expenditure at the same time.
As regards the junction of the future Russian lines with the existing railways in Prussia there are three points at which this is to be effected:-I, the Prussian Eastern Provinces line, at present all but finished to IKnigsberg, is to be continued to the common frontier, and thence carried on by the Russian Company as far as Kowno. This much is settled, 'but in what direction the line will thence proceed to join the Petersburg-Warsaw railroad is at present undetermined. 2. From Warsaw there is to be another junction road to join the said Eastern Provinces line at Bromberg, following the valley of the Vistula, and crossing the common frontier at Thorn. T'he line from Warsaw to Posen has been definitively given up. There is also a third line of junction between the present Warsaw and Cracow line and the Prussian Silesian line contemplated, which would start from the Polish station of Czenstochan and run to the Oppeln station in Prussian Silesia. The object of this junction is to avoid subjecting the Russian traffic with the south-euat of Prussia to the necessity of passing over the Austrian frontier, which it does at present at Sezakowa, while only one station farther it crosses into Prussia at Myslowitz; it there has to undergo all the formalities and expense attendant on two Custom-houses and tariffs. In the event of any future hostilities with Austria the inconvenience of this traffic between Russia and Prussia being compelled to pass over Austrian territory would be felt still more sensitively than it was lately, when only a considerable amount of coolness existed between the to COUnltrieS.

The Burglary At Ashover, Derbyshire.
THE BURGLARY AT ASHOVER, DBRBYSHIRE.
On Monday morning the man supposed to have been one, if not the chief, of the burglars concerned in this murderous outrage was apprehendedin BirminghLa. The DaiZ Press of that town, published on Taesday, an plies the following particulars :-" On Mondayinorning r. Inspector Glossop was joined in the police court by MIr. Holmes, superintendent, from Ashover. With deep and characteristic knowledge Mr. Glossop of course understood the mission of Mr. olmes, and proceeded to render that gentleman his valuable assistance. At once the officer fixed upon a well-known house in Duddeston-row and the two detectives proceeded there. Thehouse is kept by a M Haden, whose husband left the country at his country's expense some time ago, and on their visit Messrs. Gloesop and Holmesproceeded tO search the place. Ms. Haden denied that any one was concealedthere, and her statement was borne out by the fact that no one was found, although the beds had all been used. Thrown off the scent for a time, Mr. Glossop suggested a visit to all the neighbouring doctors, the hospitals and the leech women. With promptitude and vigour these visits were made, and yet no trace of the 'wanted' was discovered. Again, in a reliable assurance, the determined pursuers paid their attentions to Mrs. Haden. On the scond visit they found the amiable lady placing the articles used for tea, and though she appeared to expect no visitors, and was alone with ber son, yet she placed three cups upon the tray-board. A fact so simple would have escaped an ordinary observer, but the mind of the able detective who watched it could not pass it over, 'Why do you lay three cups, Mrs. Haden r was asked, and ' Oh, I always do,' was the reply. The suspicions were strengthened, and again the house was scrupulously searched, but with an unsuccessful result. Aai Mmin Haden was relieved of her pryingvisitors, who devoted their energies to otherplaces. After turmoil and trouble, with cabs and care, a clue was given to the whereabouts of the absentee, A leech woman living in the neighbourhood was found, and at once confessed that she had placed six leeches upon the abdomen of a man wounded by shot, who was staying at Mrs. Haden's, at 10 o'clock that morning, and was ordered to do the sarme this morning. Of course this was a guarantee that the man was not far distant, and, though all Mrs. EHaden's neighbours positively affirmed that they had seen no one leave the house, the officers believed he was concealed in an adjoining house. After minute inquiries of the most patient and prsevering character, it was discovered that a woman in a baok yard had occasionally done charing service for Mrs. Haden. This woman was visited, but stoutly denied that any one was in her house. Mr. Glossop sDggested that sae should allow Mr. Holmes to search the house. but the delicacy of the woman would not allow of a strange gontleman going into her bedroom in the absence of her husband, whoshe aegedwasatwork. Upon this refusal, Mr. Glossop determined to follow his own inclination, and seized the candle to go upstairs The woman turned pa!e ans the officer put his foot upon the first step. BeforI hlowever, he could repeat the movement, a voice from the room above, in a resigned though tremulous tone, called out -' It's all nght, Mr. Glossop, come ap.' The now successful officer obeyed the invitation, and on his entrance into the dark secluded bedroom he found two men in bed. One of them he Icnew well, as a man who had been transported for 14 years; and who had returned home after six years' absence, in 18aa. He wvas a ticket-of-leave man, who had been reported by Mr. Glossop to the Recorder, and by t.he latter to the Home Secretary, as a fit and proper person to have his ticket of leave repealed. This was the man he had looked for-the hero of a hundred daring thefts, the man wbo had given them so much trouble, was caught at last. He was then uncovered, and immediately under h s stomach, extending over a considerable space, shot mark, inflammsation, and laceration were discovered. One of h s ankles was sprained, and, with the injuries he had received from powder, shot, wadding, and running, he was unable to walk. He w as, howtever, attended to in a very careful manner, and conveyed in a cab to the Moor-street lock-up, where he was examined by Mr. Salomons, surgeon, who discovered that all the shots bad been extracted. The man -ho was found in bed with the prisoner was the tenant of the house, and husband to the bashful woman wbo ;didn't like her bedroom searched. The prisoner is a weU known leader of the most desrate sang of burglars in the country, who malse Birmingham their headquarters. His name is Thomas Weston, but he is known to his fellows and to the police by the cognomen of' Shogg,a and is a wellUmade, powerful fellow. All who read mhig narrative will, we are sure, be struck with the extraordinary vigilance and alacrity displayed by Mr. Gloeeoo in so speedily captrig _ ch.a notorious felon, and the t and promptitude he l aa displaye4 wiuil. tey excite our a&6 ratip. deserve better reward than mere eoom limeu."W

Young Men's Christian Association.
YOUNG MEN'S OHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION.
The 12th annual meeting of this association was held on TTesday evening in Exeter-hall. The large .oom was completely filled. The Earl of Shaftesbury presided.
After a prayer had been offered up by the Rev. H. Gurney,
The noble CHAnerjA. (who was most cordially received by the meeting) said he hoped they would excuse him if he did not exercise the privilege of a chairman on that occasion by infalctinz upon them a preliminary address; but he had been obliged to leave the House of Lords in extreme haste there being a debate in that House of grat imnportance,
he must return there as soon as possibe. He, however, less regretted that he was not able to address them, because he knew of nothing further to say, thanks be to God for it, than that which tended to thanksgiving and congratulation. (Cheers.)
The Secretary then read the report, which gave a most gratifying account of the progress which the association had made auring the past year in the formation of branch associatona throughout the country. The amount of the expeaditure and liabIlities of the association was 3,7301., and of the receipts 2,630l., having a balance of 1,1001. owing by the association.
3,r. T. H. GLADSTONE narrated the results of the observations he had made during his recent tour on the American continent in regard to the operations of the Young Men's Christian Association in that country. Great energy and speed had characterized the American associations which lwithin a ear had spread from the north-eastern extremity in Lower Canada and the New England States, across a tract of 2,000 miles, to the south-western extremity of that continent; and in another vear it was expected they would cross the steep crags of the Rocky Mountains, and plant an association on the shores of the Pacific at California. Their operations were some.what similar to those of the English associations, but they appeared to him to be more practical, and to develope more of the secular element, in obtaining, for instance, employment for young men, and supplying relief to the sick and the dying. He mentioned these traits that they might be imitated by the young men of England, as they were really as much a part of a Christian's duty as that of imparting spiritual advice and consolation. The associations of France, unlike those of America, were characterized by great simplicity, earnestness, and unquenchable devotion - at the same time they were, in contrast with those oi America, remarkable for their obscurity. They, however, did great work, notwithstanding the persecutions to which they were exposed. In Germany the associations rendered themselves remarkable by their activity and by developing the social element; so much so that they had become, as it were, so many homes and centres of attraction to the young men. He would invite the young men of England to combine the activity which was displayed by the associations in America, the earnest spirituality and simplicity 'which were displayed by their brethren in France, and the social welcome and Christian affection which so conspicuously prevailed in Germany, and unite them together in one arnmonious whole, and thereby make it the boast of England that not only was she the parent of these associations, but that she presented to the world the eml3odiment of all the Christian qualities of which they were susceptible. (Cheerm)
The meeting was then addressed by the Rev. J. Graham on "Spiritual progress;" the Rev. J. H. James, who particularly directed his remarks to the " unconverted" young men; by the Rev. Mr. LandeUs, and the Rev. Newman Hall.
The proceedings of the evening closed by singing the Doxology and passing a vote of thanks ho Lord Shaftesbury, who had presided at the earhier period of the meeting, and to Mr. Bevan, who subsequently took the chair.

The Curragh Camp.
THE CURRAGH CAMP.
TO THiE EDITOR OF THIE TIMES.
Sir,-Will you allow me to add my testimony to the appeal of the minister from the Curragh Camp, which appeats in your paper of to-day, and through your voice tell to England that as a visitor for many past years to the Unionhouse of our large town, andspeciaUy to the "foul" wards of said union, I know of no clmss of unfortunate sinners who are so hardly dealt with by Enilish hearts as those wretched woomen who seek shelter there . It is shelter from rain, and wind, and ill-treatment, and they have food and fire, and medical care. But what Is there before them when they wish to leave? Starvation or sin. I have seen dozens of them, softened and brought to their senses by long seclusion in that fearful ward, and longing to lead a better life when they left; but who would employ them? who would even sbelter them? In their own emphatic words, "We must die on a dunghi22, or sin !" and their old vile life, detestable to many, is adopted rather than death. I have supported many a one for weeks after they have left, and never found reason to fear they had gone back to their "waUlowing in the mire"' tiU the very last penny was spent. I could teU you tales of individual sorrow in this way which would make their way to every gentle woman's heartaye, and noble man's heart too. Why not have a reformatory ward in every union, where, when relieved from the first pressure of bodily illness which brought them in, they might be trained to earn their bread vhen they leave-at iany rate, not be driven from the " foul ward" (properly so called) into the " wide, wide world" to inevitable iDiquity ? By mouth used to be stopped when they asked me, " What cen we do ?' A simple penitentiary ward, where those veary of their former life might learn to live decently, and seek situations from thence, this is what is needed. Ask any one who reads this to go and see for themselves that "foul" ward of the union-house near them, and see if I have overdrawn my statement. One may well say of it as one enters, " Lasciate ogni speranza." I could tell you of those who have listened to me as little children when I have sat down with them and reasoned of "righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come," who, when I meet them now in the town on errands of sin, cover their faces lest I shouId shake my head sadly at them, showing there is womauly shame still 1eft an many of them "more sinned against than sinning."

TO THE EDITOR OF THEi TIMES.
Sir, -In O7a Times of yesterday there vas a letter headed 'Transport in the Crimea," which, with other matter, suggested that, "had the Commissariat exercised the same forethought shown in this respect by the officers of the Guards, who kept the horses they had devoted to the purpose I have referred to (conveying supplies, &c.) at Bala-
(lava, it would not have broken down, as it did, at an early period of the siege."
The tone of the letter is so gentlemanlike, and so different from most remarks of late made on any subject connected i%ith the Commissariat, that I trust the writer of it wiU pareon sue if I set him right as to the Commissariat Division Transport.
The transport animals of the Light, Second, and Fourth Divisions were kept at Balaldava, and the Commissariat officers started thence early in the morning with their loads, as suggested in the letter. The writer may remember that Balakhava was a emanl village, affording only limited space for picketing horses, and that objections were strongly urged against keeping a large nnmber there on sanitary grounds.
But, Sir. how can the intelligence of the Commissariat be expected to remain at all times equal to all emergencies (for it is to this department that every duty, not purely military or medical, is in time of war assigned), when we see those officers who were promoted for their seal and exertions in the Criniea now rusting on half pay, with small prospect of active employment?
We all feel deeply that in your remarks yesterday on "thoss special corps whicb cannot, like regiments of the line, he augmented at discretion, but whichrequire long and careful traminin" we were not considered worthy of notice, not bemng even alluded to.
No department requires a more careful training than the Commissariat, none needs a more thoroughs revision, and none is at this n oment more dispirited and dejected.

CROOK T. W1}ITLEY.
(Before Otk LORD CN&Cc1LLOt1 .)
Ims was an appeal from Vice-Chancellor Wood, and related to the construction of the will of a personnamed Ann Orred. By the will in question, dated the 12th of August, 1847, the testatrix, after devising and appointing certain real estate to the use of John Johnson, whom she believed to be the nearest male relative of her late mother, through whom she thereby declared that she had acquired considerable property, bequeathed, inter alia, as follows :-" I bequeath unto each of the present nieces of Peter Eaton, late of Halton, in the county of Chester, surgeon, deceased, for her own absolute benefit, the sum of 2,0001., and in case any of them shall die in my lifetime leaving a child or children who shall survive me, then, ard in every or any such case, the legacy intended for her so dying shall go to her child or children in equal shares if more than one." Peter Eaton was the first cousin once removed of the testatrix, He died in 1792, and at the date of the will there was living only one niece of his in the first degree-nanael, Sarh ocles, a widow, 75 years old, who had had two children, b-th of whom were then dead; but in the second and third degree there were living 38 other nieces-viz., 8 preatnieces, daughters of deceased nieces; 14 great-great-nieces, granddaughters of Sarah Eccles and the deceased nieces; al-so S daughters of nephews of Peter Eaton, and 8 granddaighters of such nephews. The bill prayed a declaration that the words " I bequeath unto each of the present nieces of Peter Eaton," &c., included two of the plaintiffs, who were the daughter and granddaughter of Eleanor W hitehead, one of the nieces of Peter Eaton, in the first degree, who died before the date of the will; or, in case such should not be the true constrmction of the bequest, that it might be declared that by the latter part of the bequest the plaintiffs Hannah Crook aud John Whitehead, as the only twro children left by Eleanor Whitehead at her decease, were entitled each to a legacy of 2,0001. The defendants demurred, and the Vice-Chancellor allowed the demurrer, holding first that the word " nieces " must be taken in its ordinary signification, meaning nieces in the first degree; secondly, that the children of nieces who were dead at the date of the will could not take by subshtitution.
Mr. Aston and M. Tumer appeared for the appellats Mr. Rolt and Mr. Little in support of the order.
The case was not conclnded.
(Before the LORDS JusTsCES of AprEA.)
DAVEY V. DURRAMT.-SUrnx V. DURRANr.
The first of these causes was a suit instituted by a Mr. Joseph Davey against a MIr. George Durrant, the first mortgagee of an estate situate at Boumnemoutih, in Dorsetshire, known as the Banksome Estate, and two ladies named Smith and other persons interested in the equity of redlemption of the estate seeking to redeem Mr. Durrant and to foreclose the other defendants. The usual decree to redeem and foreclose had been made by the Master of the Rolls, and an account of what was due to Mr. Durrant had been taken at chambers. In taking such account and on the cross-examination of Mr. Durrant at chambers it ap peared that the plaintiff, lr. Davey, was a trustee of the mortgage moneys lent by him for Mr. Durrant, and also that a sale of part of the estate alleged to have been made in June, 1852, by Mr. Dnrrant, as mortgagee, with power of sale to a Mr. Packe for 12,0001., was a sle on the terms of 7,0004 part of the purchase-money being allowed to be retained by Mr. Packe, he givug r Durrant a mortgage for that amount on that portion of the estate pur. chased by him. On these facts being discovered, the Misses Smith, having filed their bill to set aside the sale to Mr. Packe and to redeem the whole estate, applied by summons at chambers to discharge the Chief Clerk's certificate and to stay further proceedings in the first sult. That summons was heard before the Master of the Rolls in court, who discharged it with costs, The plaintiffs in the second suit thereupon appealed to the Lords Justices, who on the 10th of February gave liberty to the last-named plaintiffs to serve a notice of motion in their sat to stay proceedings in the suit of "Davey v. Darrant," and directed that motion, together withthe motion to discharge the order of the Master of the RolLs and the Chief Clerk's certificate, to come on before them on this day. In the meantime the answers of Messrs. Darrant, Davey, and Packe had been filed to the bill in " Smith v. Dnrrant," whereby it appeared that other parts of the estate had been conveyed away for the purposes of building a chapel and a "sanatorium," and the Misses Smith had amended their bill, seeking to set aside such conveyances, as well as the conveyance to Mr. Packe.
Mr. BAGSHAWX and Mr. WBi mGTON CooPBRP now applied, on behalf of the Misses Smith, for an order discharging the order of the Mfaster of the Rolls and the Chief Clerk's certificate, and staying all further proceedings under the decree in "Davey v. DIurrant."
After the case had been opened at considerable length,
Their LORDSHIPS suggested, and all parties consented, to the following order, which was to be vithout prejudice to any question in either cause:-" The plaintiffs in ' Smith v. Durrant' undertaking to abide by any order which their Lordships shall make for or in respect of foreclosure of the mortgaged hereditaments, and to present a petition for rehearing of the cause of 'lDavey v. Dsrrant,' and to give notice of motion before their Lordships for a decree in the cause of ' Smith v. Dorrant,' within 14 days after the filing of the answer of the defendants Davey and Darrant to the amended bill in ' Smith v. Darrant.' Stay all proceedings under the decree in 'Davey v. Dorrant' until further order. The several motions and the rehearing of 'I Davey v. Darrant' and the hearing of 'Smith v. Darrant' to come on for hearing before their Lordships on the sixth cause day in Trinity Term next."
Mr. Lloyd, Mtr. R. Palmer, Mr. Shapter, Mr. Do Gex and Mr. Baggallay appeared for the several other parties.
STOtTONv V. STOUTON.
This was an appeal from a decision of the Master of the Roils, who had appointed the mother of a child its guardian. The question arose as follows:-The late Mr. John Stourton on his marriage settled 10,0001. upon himself for life, then upon the wife for life, and ultimately (in the events which have happened) in trust for the only child of the marriage a son aged nine years and 10 months. The father who was brother of the present Lord Stonrton, died in May, 1847, and the child was born seven days afterwards. The husband ad the wife were Roman Catholics, but the latter about 1852 ceased to be a member of that communion, and soon afterwards became a member of the Church of England. Up to the time of the lady's secession from the Roman Church the child had been allowed to attend at places of worship of that faith, the chapel at Stourton and other places of worship ; but sabsequently to that event it had been eduoated, with the full knowledge of and without any remonstrance from the relations of the father, in the tenets of the Church of England, and was now placed in the care of a Mr. King, a Master of Arts of Trinity College, Cambridge, at his honse, at Brighton. The ladytn her affidavit said that she had abjured the Roman Church because she conscientiously disbelieved the doctrine of transuabstantiatlon, and she had carefully educated her child from his earliest years in the doctrines of the Church of England.
Mr. BAGSSrIAE, sen., and Mr. BAGSHLAWE, iUnn, appeared in support of the appeal; and argued that the examination of the child was of no use, since its later impressions must necessarily be those of a Protestant; but the question for the Court to consider was what was the religion of the father and would asme that were he alive he would feel it his duty to educate hisson intho same faith as his own.
Mr. Rou.n,DELL PdALrn and Mr. G. M. GI-rm for the respondent, quite agreed that the opinions of the child oug ht not to guide the Court, but it would take into its most serious consideration that if the boy were handed over to Roman Catholic instructors the result would inevitably be that the Holy Scriptures, to which he had boen taught to appeal as the only infallible guide, would bo forthwith withdrawn from his study, the members of that communion teaching that the free use of the Bible was not to be permitted.
Mr. BAGSHAWi, sen., in reply, denied that the Roman Catholic Church did not permit the unrestricted use of the Word of God in its authorized version, for, on the contraty, it permitted the reading of suoh parts of the Old Testament as it considered fit for perusal, that Church, however, holding that there were parts of the Old Testb.ment, and therein agreeing with St. Paul, which were hard to be understood. Bat with regard to the Now Testament the Roman Catholio Church teachers unreservedly placed it in the hands of children even of tender years, provided such children wers capable of reading it. He called upon the Court t, rermit the child to be brought up in the religion of its father.
Lord Justice KIIGIIT BituCE.-When willit be convenient for the boy to attend here?
Mr. PALSIER said he was in the custody of Mr. King, at Brighton, but could be in London by 1 o'clock on Saturday.
Lord Justice K.XNiGT BnucL.-Let the case stand in the paper of Saturday.

This was a sait for the specifio performance of an agreement, in which the only question raised was whether,under certain words in a contract for the sale of a weaving. mill, the looms in it passed to the vendee under a general description as fixtures and machinery belonging and attached to the millU The precise words of the contract were-" together with the steam-engine, boiler, pipes, miUl-gearing, gasometer, drums, wheels, and all other the machinery, fLxtures and effects fixed up in, attached, or belonging to the said mil or factory, building or premises," -and under these words the plaintiff contended the looms of the miU passed. The Court, however, was of a different opinion, and held that, under the words cited, nothing more passed than what was specifically set forth or escentially formed part of the mill. The looms of a mill were merely furniture which could be changed and moved about from time to time, forming no more part of its machinery or property than a carpet formed part of a house.
Mr. R. Palmer, Mr. Iloyd, Mr. Follett, Mr. Bird, Mr. C. Hall, and Mr. Eddis appeared in the case.

On the 29th of September, 1855, the defendant had a1so sisned a memorandum to the same effect as the power of attorney, in consideration of the plaintiff's forbearance, promismg at the Eame time to execute a legal mortgage to him.

RE BItOOKY.R'S ESTANE.-BROOKLsR V. =30bKIER.
This was a motion for the ap2ointment of a receiver, and for an injiuntion. In June, 1uos, an order was mrde, on a summons talcen out at the Vice-Chancellor's Chambers by Caroline Brooker, for the administration of the estate of W. Brooker, who died intestate, and to whose widow, Sarah Brooker, letters of administration of his effects had been granted. The widow of the intestate had carried in her accounts before the Vice-Chanceuor's Chief Clerk, but it was Alleged, on behalf of Caroline Brooker and of James Brookerod the laintiff in the suit of "pBrooker v. Brooker,sn that the widow hadreceiged sumsnforming prt otheintesute's esaute for which she had not accunted; and James Brooker fioe his bill against the widow and Cou inst Ctr of Brookefe, prayimg for the appointment 0 a receiver f the intetates estate, and for an inutbilon to restrain the widow fro aladministering t. The question was whether the Court ha power to grat an applictionl for the appoint. mont of a receiver and for and gn ction au injprceings arising on an administratiOn summons at the Vice.Chan cellor's chambers. It was contended ont behalf of James Brooker, the plaintiff in a wBrooker v. Brooker,'tthat the ctourt could grant such an Application only when prayed for by bilL
odr. Bacon and Mr. J. H. Taylor appeared for Caroline Brooker; M. Marims and Mr. Osbo the or ames Brooker; and er. rogers, for the widow of the intestate.
The VICE-CHA rCiLLo dsaid that he had a very strng sense of the importance Of the question which had been arguet L The order fs r the administration ot a tttor's or intestate's esttte nisije by summons at chambers had all the effect of a decree made in a suit for the same purpose. The Legislatare had given to the judges of this court the power of making such varitions as circumstances might require in the decretal ordert s de on summons at chaibers. nhgswas a large power with which to invest the judges, and in proportion to its extentishould be the degree of discretion with which it was exeroised. No judge of the court would feel himself at liberty to use that power in such a way as to excite any doubt that what had deen done by hinm was due to tho rights of all the parties affected by his order. The present motion was made on behalf of a plaintiff in an administration summeon after a decretal order for the admiinistration of the estate, and it asked the Coullrt toga point a receiver, and to grant AnInjunction to restrain te
administutrix from interfering faaurther in theadministration of the esate. Such an application, whether in aisuit or e CArii onua su mmons, could only be supported by evieno e of the grossest misconduct on theVpart of the legal personal representative. it had been argued that no injunction or receiver could be granted or appointed unless praYed for by bill. It never, howvever, was the practice of the Courk~ after decree, to refuse an application for anh injunction and reeiver even where they were not prayed for by the bill. On the contrary, the Court had alwaYs been in the habit -by its order after decree, and without any prayer in the bm for the purposes, but on an application made summarilY for the protetion of the estate -of apoting a receiver and granting an injunction.

ir. BOToe,d r. CAsxs, and Mr. BAGGALLAY moved, on behalf of the defendants in this cae, that the time for the commencement ofthyith the ijnt r ted by the order dated the 5th of November, 1856, ad tena ded to thc a 1t of March, 1857, by order of the Lord Chancellor, might be enlarged until the ist of September, p857, the defendants offering and undertakigto y the plainrtiff any sam directea by the Court in rpt the damage, iflAny, oreasioned by this extension of time. The cue has been alrady beforethe Court upon several occasions,and itwillbe nfficient atpresent toCstate thatonthe5th of November, 1856, the Vice Chancellor granited an injunction restrainingthe defenldants, from and after theq1etJanuary, 1857, froma manufacturing gas and coke so as to allow the escape of steam, ps, or other matter noxious to the vegetation in the plaintifi's grounds. Thirs order was appealed froma to the Lord Chancelor, whO after hearing the Arguments, calld in the assistance of two common law jhdges, andlhad the wmtter renrgued. On the 31st of January the order of the Vice-Chancellor was afprmed, except that the time for the commencement of t injunction was enlarged ntil them st of March, 1857, the dlefendants undert.aleng to pay the plaintiffanysuma directedl by this Court in respect of damage occasioned by such extension of time. In support of the tresent application the defendants had filed an affidavit by Mr. bkham, their chief engineer, stating that extensive alterations had been. made in the retort-houses, for the purpose of ipreventing the
dants'works.The efect o this accident had been
seriousyt delay the poetdatrtos and it was sttdtat these alteain,w ic t wsbelieved would effectually prevent the escape Of any noxious mnatter, couald not now be complet-ed in less than six months fromx Mhr. elwtynsand Mr. Greene, on behalf of the plaintiff, opposed the motion.
The VICE-CHANCELLOR Said that the only thing weighing with him vas as to how far it miight be for the plaintiff's own interest to comply with the application. There might be a wide question raised hereafter as to the attempts of ihle company to abate the nuisnce upon a motion to comumit for br,each of the injunction. The plaintiff, however, sloodi upon his right which he had under the injunction, such right having been affirmed upon appeal, while previously to any procedings in this court he had established his lega right bfore the learned Arbitrator, Serjsant Channell, who had been recently made one of the barons of theo Exchequer. Hfe thought that thie Court ouglht to interfore to quiet a title thus established, and thxat the plaintiff ought not to be put to any further litigation, or to) be subjected to the har Asand vexation of a secon,d trial after he had obtained a decree of this Couirt.

increased probability of their having to remedy the nuisance. This course, however, had not been adopted, and with resDect to the experiments there was very considerable possibility of their breaking down. Nor was he satisfied with the affidavit which had been filed. He ought not to compel the plaintiff any longer to wait the oonvenience of the company, or be further harassed in the matter. Possibly some arrangement might be made between the parties, bnt cx concessis damage would be occasioned in the interval to the plaintifi's vegetables, and a permanent possible damage to his trade and repatation, by losing his customers, &c. Under the present circQmstances he could not do moro than refuse the application, with coats.

(:stings in BanCo. after Term, beforcI J'U4gtes COLERnIGE,
WIGuINrA-W, and ERLS.)
The COURT sat this day for a short time, in order to give Pdgment in several case8 which bad been previonsly argued. lhe only case involving any question of general intrest was the following:-
TIE QUf? V. THE OVMSBxMS OF OHRIq PURCIf,
SPITALFiELDS.
In thig case a manndam{ had fibued to the overseers of Chtist Church, Spitalfields, commanding them to deliver up to the prosecutor, James Baynton, tho rate-boolb of the parish. To this -rrit the overseers made as return, and thus veveral iwui, In fact, were raised, which were afterwards tried before Lord Campbell' At Guildball It was then agreedthat an tbe fat bshould be stated in the form of a "pcixie. for the ojInion olt the Court. This being done two questions were raiMed-1, whether the prosecutor hzd been l-gally removed from his effloe of poorrate colltor? ad, 2, whether tho defendants ve legally
bound to deliverup the books to him? It appeed that the affairs of the par-ish Of Christ Church w ere regulated by sever ocal acts, one ot which, the 2d of George II., chap. 10, constituted a select vestry, which was to consist of a certain numaber qualified according to the act, and also to include all those who had filed the office of churchwarden or overseer. The number of vestrymen was thus indeterininate, though at the time when the prosecutor was removed from his otice the vestrymen were about 0O in number. It ap'peared that in the month of September, 1854, Some complaints were made of the mode in. which the prosecutor discharged his duties, and a meeting of the select veetry was held to consider the subject. The prosecutor being a select vestryman also attended. Oit of the 80 vestrymen 35 attended the meeting; and, Nvhen a motion wasput forthe prosecutor'sremovalfrom his office, themotion was carried by a majority of 16 to 11 votes, the other eight vestrymen wvho were present declining to take any part in the proceeding. The first question raised for the opinion of the court was, whether, under these circumstances, the pro. secutor hsd been properly removed ? This depended on the construction of the 14th section of a local act (the 18th of George IlL, chap. 74), vhich enacted that the select vestry i or the major part of them," should have power toappoint collectors of the poor rates"at anymeeting to beheld in the vestryroom of the parish," after due notice, a similar power being given as to the dismissal of such officers. The second question was whether, supposing the prosecutor to have beon improperly removed, the overseers could legally be req~uired to give up the rate-books to him? The main question on the argument was, whether the majority required by the A ct must be a majority of these actually present at the meeting, or whether a majority of these who actually voted wras sumcneent ?
These questions were argued at the sittings after term before the four puisne judges of this Court, by Mr. H. Hill, Q. C. (with whom was Mr. Macnamara), for the prosecutor: and by Mr. Atherton, Q.C., for the select vestry. The Court having taken time to consider,
Mr. Justice WIGHTMArN now delivered the judgment of the Court in favour of the Crown. The question was whether Mr. Baynton had been properly removed from his office of poorrate coUector. The question depended on the construction of the 14th section of a local act, 18th of G eorge IJ., chap. 74), which enacted that the select vestry,
or the ajor part" of them, should have the power to appoint a collector at any meeting held in the vestryroom of the parish, after due notice, and, in the same manner, should have the power to remove him. Notice was given of a meeting of the vestry to be held for the purpose of considering the conduct of Mr. Baynton. Thirty- five members of the select vestry, out of the 80 who at that time composed that body, attended the meeting, and Mr. Baynton, who was himself as select vestryman, also attended. On a motion being put for his removal, 16 members voted for the removal, and 11 against it, the other eight members who were present taking no part in the proceedigs. Upon the argument it
.as contended, on the part of the Crown, that, though it was not necessary that there should be a majority of the thole body of the vestry, it was necessary that a majority of those who were present should concur in the vote for the removal, and that the members who were present, but who took no part, comld not be considered as absent, and consequently, that in this case there was no majority for the removal. The Court thought that that was the right view of the case, and that there was not such a majority as the ract required. The majority did not concur in affirming the act, for the majority either voted against it tor did not vte
at all. Sutppose that five only had voted for the removal, and that the remainder did not vote at all, could that be said to be the act of the majority? The Eynsham Case" (12, Q.B., 398) was in point. The next question was, w hether the prosecutor wvas entitled to have the rate-books delivered up to him for the putrpose of collecting the rates which had not yet been collected?t The Court thought there w as no legal objection could be made to that, and that the prosecutor was entitled to the possession of them.
Judgment for the Crown.
The COUnT delivered judgment in about seven cases.
MIr. Justice Esex then delivered judgment in one or two matters argued before his Lordship in the Bail Court.
The COURT then rose.

SMITH V. LAKEMAN.
At the sitting of the Court this morning,
The foreman of the jury addressed Lord Campbell. He had been requested by the jury to ask his Lordship whether there would be any additional remuneration to the jury for attending this long trial ? To some it had been attended with considerable loss.
Lord CKAMPBsEL.- Gentlemen, I am sorry to say it is not in my power to give you any additional remuneration. I regret that you should be detained, but public duty requires it, and I hope you will perform it cheerfUlly.
A juror said he had lost between 251. and 301. yesterday, commission on chartering a shin.
Lord CAMPBELL.-I regret it exceedingly, but yoa may console yourself by knowing that you are discharging your duty to the country.
Lord CAMPBELIL then said, he had been looking at the issues, and he was bound to say that the Lords Justices nwere perfectly justified in sending aU the issues here.
The trial of the cause was then resumed.
The evidence on the part of the plaintiff was concluded.
Mr. Serjeant BYLES then addressed the jury on the part of the defendant. It was a case which involved against the defendant not only the most atrocious wrongs, but felony and forgery. The case originaly was heard beforeVice-Chancellor bthart, who, in July, 850, pronoanced judgment in favour of the defendant, apon which there was an appeal to the Lords Justices, and upon that appeal the value which should begiven to the two disputed accounts came under consideration, and the Lords Justices considering that the accounts were not conclusive sent the matter down to ViceChanceUor Stuart's clerk; he misunderstood the order, and from his decision there was an appeal to Vice-ChanceUor Stuart again; he adhered to his original decision, and there was an appeal to theLords Justices,who tried their hands at the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. They had before them the plaintiff andthe defendant, and they were examined and cross-examined not only by counsel, bht by those lights of the profession, the Lords Justices, and they found a discrepancy in the evidence which they could not reconcile. The plaintiffsaid one thing and the defendant another, and they sent the case to the most proper tribunal for such matters; they sent it to the Court of Queen's Bench, for they said "We are lin a strait between two stools; we can't tell which way to decide," and therefore it came before the Lord Chief Justice and a special jury,-in his opinion the most satisfactory tribunal for the determination of questions of fact, better than any improvement of the law could ever discover. The plaintiff had admitted that he had signed certain docaments, but he said he was taken in and deluded. Hle swore more than once that he was taken in and deceived, but after the account he had given of his former life, having been enX ed in manyr mercantile ursuits, it was difficult to be eve in such innocence. T1he learned counsel animadverted at considerable length upon the evidence which had been given, showing the mode of rigging the market, and, afterthat had been accomplished, and all the shares had been disposed of, and the promoters of the scheme had got the money for them, down went the shares, no one would touch them with a pair of tongs, and back fled the Yankee speculatorto his own shores; bat they had still the satisfaction of having Mr. Smith among them. The plaintiff said he kept no books,-people who dealt in these transactions did not keep books,-and then anything conld be asserted or denied, as suited the purpose of the party giving evidence. The parties here completely contradicted each otb er. (The evidence has already appeared, as given in the Court of the Lords Justices, in which it will berecoUected that the plaintiff had stated that he dined with the defendant, who afterwards took him to the Lyceum Theatre; thence to supper at 3, Park-place, Regent's Park, where there were two ladies; that the defendant pressed him to take wine until he was overcome, and put to bed; that upon awakin in the morning he found himself in bed with one of these ladies, that the defendant then got him downstairs to breakfast, and in the room induced him to sign some papers which had formed very prominent features in the litigation which followed. The defendant, on the contrary, stated that the documents were signed in his counting-house, and that the plaintiff perfectly well knew what he was doing.) The learned Serjeant then compared the evidence, given by the plaintiff in his answer in Chancery with that given by him in this court. He then stated the case he should lay before the jury on the lpart of the'defendant, but it is utterly impossible to render the details intelligible to the general reader.
The Court adjourned ot 5 o'clock.
There will be a Second Court to-morrow.

The trial of this action, %yhich was brought on a contract for the completion of a screw steamship, having lasted during the greater portion of tbe day, was at the suggestion of the Lord Chief Justice terminated by a formal verdict for the plaintiffs being entered subject to a reference.
Mr. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. Ktsnplay were counsel for the plaintiffs ; Mr. Mellor, Q.C., and Mr. J. Browne for the defendants.
tapl'SON AND OTHIERS V. TIlE ACCIDENTAL DEATH
INSURANCE -COMPANY.
T{fs was an action brought by the executors and executrix of a merchant named Sinmpson, who had insured his life in the office of the defendants, to recover the sum of
2,f 001., alleged to be due on the death by accident of that ! gentleman.
Mr. Serjeant Byles, Mr. Wilsle, Q.C., and Mr. Garth ap. peared for the plaintiffs; Mr. James, Q.C., .Mr. Hawkim, end Mr. Millward were counsel for the defendants.
It appeared that on the 27th of January in last year Mr. Simtpson, who then resided at Abbey-wood, near Erith, haning returned from church (that day being6 Snday), in going towards the fireplace of onle of the roomls in his residence, stumhled, and fell with his face against the bars of the grate. EIs upper lip, which encountered the top bar, was ahnost cut off; his front teeth were knocked ejut, he
was stunned, much burnt, and otherwise seriously in'ured. On the 1st of February he died, and there can he no oubt, from the evidence of all the surgeons called, among whom wvas Mr. Lawrence, of St. Bartholomew's, that the accident was the moving cause of the death. On the 4th notce was given to the defendants, who sent their surgeon downto view the body, and on the 13th a letter declining to pay the sum assured. Tho plaintiffs afterwards discovered that the premium for tbe current year had not been paid, and that on this very 13th of February, or the day before, the days of grace-viz., 21, for payment of such premium (121.) bsd expired.
In this case, as in many others since the abolition of special demurrers, the pleadings were of the most exuberant nature, and embraced equitable pleas and pleas called equitable and double replications, &c., but, as in the course of the trial the Lord Chief Justice observed that he bad long foreseen that some very nice points must arise when circumstances similar to those which were now before him took place, and that he would reserve all points of law for argument in the full court, we may divest the defence and the answer of the plaintiffs of all legal technicalty, and state it shortly as follows :-The defendants urged thatthe deceased was an unhealthy man, had asthma, and so died of an acoident the effectsof which astronger man would have recovered from. That he did not die of the injuries received at all, hut of congestion of the lungs. Thatthe premium had not been paid in due time, and that the policy was in consequence void; that according to the terms of the policy the defendants were not bound to accept the premimn and renew the policy at all. These and other arguments were advarnced by Mr. awkins, who, in the absence of Mr. James, conducted the case. In answer it was said that the 2,0001. insured became due on the day of the death of the assured, and that the defendants might have stopped the premium out of it. That by treating the policy as subsisting and valid after the death and before the 13th of February, the defendants, by their conduct. prevented the executors paying the premium, threw them off their guard, and deceived them; that they had not even taken out probate, and could notknow, unless told, that ary premium was due - that it was the duty of the defendants to have given tiem notice, instead of lying by, and when the time had run out repudiating ; that Mr. Simpson died of the accident, and of the accident alone.
The LORD CHIEF JusTIcE having summed up the case, and commented upon all the facts with great care,
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, saying, in a.nswer to questions put to them by the learned Judge, that Mr. Simpson's death w,as purely accidental, and that the company intentionally omitted to inform the plaintiffs that the premium was unpaid.
Leave to move in such manner as to raise the points of law involved in the case was given by the LORD C11IEF JUSTICE.

GINZGER V. LAW.
(Sttings at Nisi Prius, before the C11IEF B.-xoO ancZ a
Special Jaury, at Guiidkalt)
Mr. HiU and Mr. Millward were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Hannen appeared for the defendant.
This was an action in which the plaintiff sought to recover damages from the defendant for an alleged fraudulent representation as to the value and condition of certaia shares in the celebrated Tipperary Bank as an investment, and the honesty of a prospectus and balance-sheet relating to the same, on the faith of which the plaintiff bad been induced to purchase 40 of such shares. A second count treated the representations of the defendant as the foundation of a contract for the breach of which the plaintiff sought to recover the purchase-money, amounting to 5001.; and a third count was for money had and received The defendant pleaded not guilty, and a denial of the allegation that the plaintiff was induced to buy the shares through the representations of the defendant, and never indebted as to the money counts. The circumstances under which this action was brought, and the foundation on which it rested, appear in the material parts of the evidence adduced on the part of the plaintiff, which we subjoin:-
Mr. Harris.-I am now manager of a bank at St. Alban's. In 1855 I was manager of the London and County Bank at Hemel Hempstead. I was acquainted with Mr. Ginger, the plaintiff, as a customer. Mr. Law, the defendant, was one of our directors. On the 7th of April, 1855, I received this letter from the defendant:-
"1 14, Mansfield-street. Cavendish-square,
April 7, 1IM.
*Dear Sir,-I enclose you a paperembracing the prosotu and last aunual report ot th Tipperary oit sBtock sauk
As our bsareholders wil be unable to obtain any 6reater number of the new Fhares oc the London and County shares than they cau absolutely claim. it bas occurred to Mrr. 8adleir that some of them might hxe to become shareholders in one of the other established joint-stock banks. To mieet the wisese of such Persons M1r. Sadleir bas secured a certain number of sharer in the ipperary Joint-stock Bank, in which he is and has from its foundation been a large shareholder,, at a Premium of £2 lIs. per share, and I am authorlzed by hnt to place at your diposal a number not exceeding 200, upon the ,ale of any of which you will be at liberty to retain for your remuneration a commisdon of 10s. per there. Should it be more convenient to any of Your Purchasers, they can have the option of pamg a firt nstalment of £0 per share, and the residue in three insta lments of £2 IQ,& each, a6t intervals of three months. As Mr. Siadleir has the highest opinions of this investment, and feelaceuvinced the shars will command a hi8hpremuim, he is natually desirous to

"I am, dear Sir, ybnrs trnly,
P.S. IFmight, perhaps, mention that the Provincial Bank of Ireland shares, which awe principally held in England, and upon which £25 per share has been Daid, are now selling at £50; and the Royal Bank of Ireland, upon which ;l0 haa been paid, are hiow seling at zli per share.
(This letter was accompanied with a printed prospectus and balance-sheet up to the 31st of December, 1854, from which it appeared that 100,0001. had been paid up out of a subscribed capital of 500,0001.; that 6 per cent. dividends and bonuses of 71. 10s. per share had been regularly paid; and that the " customers' balances" amounted to 724,3511. 15s. 5d., and "cash in hand, Government and othersecurities, and biUs" amounted to 842,2791. 7s. 7d. These documents professed to be countersigned by " Wm. Kelly, manager," and to bear date O Clonmel, Jan. 27, 1855.") I communicated these papers to Mr. Ginger, and explainedthemto him. He raid he would consider about taking sbares, and afterwards agreed to take 10 in May. In Sep. tember he took 20 more, all at 121. 10s. per share. I received the purchase monuy from him -1251. and 250. I retained lOs. per share, according to the letter of the defendant, and the balance I remitted to the London office to the credit of the defendant. I also received 11. 17s. 6d. from the plaintiff for the stamps on the transfer, which I remitted also to the defendant. I received letters from the defendant on the 24th and 25th of April, and on the 4tb, 9th, and 11th of May, relative to the issue of the shares. I received the transfers for the plaintiff's 10 shares on the 12th of May from the defendant, and I sent up money I had received, including that of the plaintiffi (Numerous letters from the defendant to witness were then read relating to the issue of the shares, the execution of the transfers, the certificates, and (dvidend warrants. The transfers of the 9th of May and 1st of September of 10 shares each from "A Austin Ferrall," described as of Mountjoy-place, Dublin, to the plaintiff, and the certificates of such shares, were then read. These documents were signed by James Sadleir, R. Keating, and John Sadleir, and countersignedby W. Kelly, manager.) I did not know that Mr. Law wasto have a commission of 11. per share. If I had I should not have sold any shares. When I heard Mr. Sadleir had destroyed himself I returned the sums I had received for commission.
Cross-examined.-I left the London and County Bank after these transactions. At that time James Sadleir was chairman of the Tipperary Bank, and John Sadleirwas one of the trustees of that bank and chairman of oxtr bank.
Mr. Fabian, the manager of the Leighton Buzzard Branch of the London and County Bank, proved the receipt of a similar prospectus, &c., from the defendant, and the fact that by his directions he distributed shares among the customers, including 20 to the plaintiff, and the remittance of the proceeds to Mr. Law.
By the JUDGE.-I am now the manager of the Unity Bank
Cross-examined.-I did not know Mr. Law was to have a commission. I was to haveooneoof 10s. I knew Mr. John Sadleir welL He used to live near me, and came down hunting. He urged me many times to sell these shares. He told me the ca.pital was paid up, and confirmed the statements in theourospectus generally.
Re-examined.-kMr. Law also made statements to me confirmin the pros otus.
John Cinger.-f am the plaintiff. I am a farmer at Homel Hompstead. Ln consequence of the representations of Mr. Harris and Mr. Fabian, and the statements in the pro. spectus and balance-sheet, I bought 40 shares. I know nothing of the bank, except from those sources. I bought in reliance on the truth of the statements, believing the shares to be old shares,-not a new issue.
A clerk of Mr. Norris, the private solicitor of Mr. John Sadleir, was called upon to produce two letters from the defendant to Mr. Sadleir, both of which were read. One of them, which may be taken as a sample of both, was in the following terms:-
"London. TMarch 31, 1855.

The second letter equally showed that the dcfendant was cognizant of Mr. Sadleir's,cecuniary difficulties, but it contained no reference to the ipperary Bank sbares.
James Newnbam.-I am a clerk in the East of England Insurance-office, and knew the defendant for five years. He was a director, but ceased to be so last April. %I r. Sadleir was not one of our directors. In the spring of lSo5, the defendant gave me the rmanuscript draught of th,e Tipperary Bank prospectus to get printed. I copied circulars jo the mranagers of the London and County Bank bhrsitches. Mr. Sadleir and the defendant tused to ineet at our s.ffice.
Cross*exanmined.-This is the rorigirisl MS. of the prospectus. It. is irn Mr. Sadleir's handwriting, I helieve.
W. Kelly.-I becaune the mnaibager of the Tioperary Bankc in 1850, and so remained till ,t brske tip. lis6 amount of
the paid-up capita iwas 40,5501. only in 1855. I saw this prospectus in 18S6 for the first time. I never subscribed my 'name to such a document. In 1855 James Sadleir, Vncent Scully, and Mr. Wilson Kennedy were directors. Many of the names published i this prospectus never were directorr. I saw this balance-sheet first in May, 1856. Its stateuments are untrue. (It may be taken that the real amounts of the deposits and cash, &c., in hand were about doubled in the prospectus and balance-sbeet supplied to the defendantby Mr. Sadleir.) There were no shares numbered beyond 4,050. The shares in question are all numbered beyond that figure. I know Mr. Austin FerraU. He formerly lived in Mountjoy-terrace, 10 years ago, but is now a clerk to a wine merchant in London. He was registered a& the holder of 10 old shares, but not of those in these transfers. I received the transfers from Mr. Law, and an account showing that he disposed of 1,561 shares, for which he accounted to sme, at 111. per share.
Cross-examined.-James Sadleir was the elder brother of John Sadleir and the chairman of our bank. He desired me to prepare a balance-sheet in accordance with the forms used in the English banks. He gave me a form. The books showed a capital of 100,000. paid up. John Sadleir owed 120,0001. to the bank, which was treated as capital. At the meeting of 1856 a prospectus was put forward with the names of the additional directors. I spoke to him about it and he said he had their authority. The whole was a fraua concocted between James and John Sadleir. These shares issued by hlr. Law were sent to me in the usual way. We generally kept transfers unstamped. The defendant has returned himself as the holder of 50 shares, and proceedings are now being taken in Dablin to fis him as a contributory-liable for all the debts of the bank. Mr. Law accounted to the bank through Glyn's in London, and to Mr. John Sadleir for the balance. Mr. Sadleir accounted for what he got by giving us a check for the amount. That was his way of accounting. The blank certificates for these English shares were genuine when they were issued from the bank in June, 1855. Mr. James Sadleir could have got any amount of shares he wanted. They were intrusted to Mr. James Sadleir. I communicated from time to time with Mr. Law as to the issue of these shares in England. Every share he so disposed of was accounted for to the bank. The books of the bank are here, which show how Mr. John Sadleiraccounted for the proceeds to the bank, - namely, by giving his check for the proceeds.
Re-examined.-There was an account oned in Mr. Austin Ferral's name in August, 1855. We debited him with 5,945 shares, and 1,566 of those were transferred to English shareholders. Not one of them was paid up. I understood from James Sadleir that he was acting as trustee for the bank.
By Mr. J.uEs.-Mr. John Sadleir gave his check for 13,000 and odd pounds, which was put to his debit, bat never was paid.
Mr. HiLL and Mr. JAicxs both, at the conclusion of Mr. Kelly's evidence, agreed in exoneratinghim from any implication in the malpractices of Messrs. John and James Sad. leir, under whose orders he had acted.
The CHIEF BMiRoN.-Then,did Mr. Law get a commission of 11. on each of the 1,566 shares disposed of by him in England ?
Mr. HILL.-Yes, my lord, and the transfer fees also.
Mr. Towgood.-I am a stock-broker. The usual commis. sion paid on the sale of shares is 2s. 6d. per share under 201. I never knew of such a commission as 11. on the sale of such shares.
This being the case for the plaintiff,
Mr. Jutfls submitted to the Chief Baron that there was no case to go to the jury against the defendant on the two first counts ,at all events.
The Chief Baron was about to give his opinion apparently, when the learned counsel entered into a conference, and, after considerable delay,
The CBiEF B,Rox called their attention to the fact that the Court and jury were waiting.
Mr. JAMNm&-My lord, we are engaged in effecting an arrangement which shall be honourable to Mr. Law.
The CHIEp BARoN.-An honourable what, Mr. James?
The learned counsel then resumed their negotiation, and after a further interval of some length,
Mr. JAarEs said he was happy to state that he had come to an arrangement under which a verdict was to be entered for the defendant upon certain terms which were satisfactory to all parties. One of the terms of that arrangement was that Mr. Law should refund to the plaintiff and all the other English shareholders the sum received by him by way of comrnission.
Mr. HiLL.-And for the transfer stamps which never were usedl?
Mr. JAarns.-Yes; Mr. Law has agreed to those terms.
The CHur1F BARoN having expressed his surprise at the plaintiff consenting to waive his right to the verdict, at
(east on the money counts
Mr. HILL stated that his chents were acting on behalf not only of the plaintiff, Mr. Ginger, but also of all the English shareholders, and they had deemed it proper to come to an arrangement which would put an end to al further litigation and costs.
The Cur7F BARow then directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendant in pursuance of the arrangement come to between himself and the plaintiff. He could not, however, refrain from giving forth to the public his entire disapproval of the practices resorted to in the management of the Tipperary Bank. He reprobated in the strongest language the issue of the certificates of shares in blank, but agreed in acquitting Mr. Kelly of any participation in that i=propriety byond a very subordinate part indeed, addin that he believed he had objected to some things which had been done. As far as this cause was concerned, the plaintiff had chosen to agree witb his adversary, and it was only left to follow out that agreement; but he might say that, whatever might have been the result of the cause as far as the first two counts were concerned, it was clear that the plain.. tiff would have been entitled to recover the excessive Sams which the defendant had appropriated to himself by way of commissiou on the sale of these shares.
The jury then found a verdict for the defendant.

The bankrupt was a floorcloth manufacturer of the City road. This was the certificate meeting.
Mr. Norton appeared for the assignees.
His HONOUR said he had at first suppoeod that the bankru t's failure might have been occasioned by his having been a Lrector of the Deposit and General Assurance Compahv He was satisfied, however, that such was not the case. He ceased to be a director of that company in 1854 when it was in a prosperous condition and had an income of 10,0001. a-year. Although the Deposit Societywas now being wound up, the bankrupt had not in any way been the cause of its failure, and he feared that a certificate at the hands of this Court would not relieve him from any fature calls upon his sbares, of which he was the holder of 500. The bankrupt had voluntarily placed himself in ihe hands of his creditors; his estate would pay about lOs. in the pound, and but for loss on realization of stock it showed las. in the pound. There was not a single unfavomrable feature in the case; he never knew one in which a first-class certificate was more merited, and he had great pleasure in granting it.

MANSION-HOUSE.-The LORD MAYOR requested that the press 'would acknowledge the receipt of 201. from
"M E. R.," as a donation to the poor-box.
GUITDALL.-Mr. Elias William Watson, the late secretary to Lodges 17 and 18 of the Loyal United Friends Gift Fund, appeared on a sammons before Alderman ROSE to answer a charge of embezzling the moneys of the society.
Alderman ROSE adjouned the case for a week, taking the defendant's recognizances to appear.
MARYLEBONTE-A further inquiry was gone into by Mr. BROUGHTON with regard to the case of the Widow Allsop,
bhich, owing to the peculiar circumstances connected therewith, has lately caused a considerable degree of excitemeiit. The proceedings of the previous investigation by the magistrate have already appeared at some length in ITk Ti1ew.
At 1 o'clock Mrs. Allsop, agreeably to directions given by Mr. BRouGaTON to MIr. Pranklin, chief usher, came down to the court, and sat in a private room until the case was called on. She took her seat, as on the former occasion, just below the box appropriated to counsel, and which is in close proximity to the bench.
Mir. BROUGHTON.-Whea youwere here this day week you said you had a document about you of some importance to yourself; have you that docament in your possession now7
Mrs. Allsop.-I have not, Sir.
MIr. BROUGHTON.-What was it all about?
Mrs Allsop.-It was therein stated that I was known to thp_persons to whom it referred.
Mr. BROUGHTON.-Yes, in al'the communications leferred to you were known, but no one appears to know anything about your sons. There is a dispute about your being known. (Mrs. Allsop produced a paper, which she offered
Mr. BnouGwroy...Where did you get this from?
rs Allsop.-From the War-office. I ms eani
again. I had It inaNovember.Imust return it
M hthr. BCEOUGE7TON.-In what regiment did your sons serve
Mrs. Allsop.-They never joined any regiment. Mr. BROUGHTON.-Ae you sure of that ?
Maf Allsop.-Yes ; they were clerks in Lord Raglaa's department.
MIr. BROUGHTON.-How did they get into the Crinea? M Allsop.-They were sent for from Iniia, but never joined any regiment. I thought they would have entered the Sappers and Miners.
Mr. Bnoueserox examined the document from the War. office, and thereupon remarked that it was a curious thing that the regiment inserted was in a different handwriting and in different ink.
Mrs. Allsop.-That is in the handwriting of Lady Thesiger, who had interested herself in my behalf. I received the paper from the War-office from Lady Thesiger.
At this stage of the proceedings Mr. Broughton directed Mr. Franklin to go to the residence of Lady Thesiger for the parpose of making the necessary inquiries.
.Mr. RouGIITON.-Then, in point of fact, your sons were never in any regiment?
Mrs. Allsop.-They were not, to my knowledge, in the Crimea.
Mr. BROUGGTON.-Nor in any action ? Mrs. Allsop.-Not to my knowledge.
Mr. BROUGHTON.-Did you ever know General Brooke? Mrs Allsop.-Yes; but he has been dead some years.
Mr. BROUGHToN.-Do you not know Major-General Brooke, Glocester-place, Portman-sonare?
MIrs. Allsop.-I never saw him *-I have written to him more than once, but could get no satisfactory answer.
Mr. BROUGHITON read a letter 'which he had received fromMajor-General Brooke,in'whichthegaUantofficersaid,-
" I have before me a letter sent to me some time since, purporting to come from Mm AUsop, but what is extraordinajy i4, that in 'zitiny to me she does not mention a word about the lees of her son.. hha camledberself the daughter of a general and I find that no man of the carse of Alsop has been in that corps Itbe 44th Regiment) holding a
hihpstion. The story madSe by her (Mrs. AJIsop Is improbable on the of It, and many credulous peoDle would say, 'What a bhame P Has she made any appUcation to the Patriotic Fnd for assistnce? There is. aapeieFoslander with regard to Illustrious persons, which is little creditableftoor the publi sese."
Mr. BROUGHTON.-Are you aware that you would be entitled to any money due to your sons, who, as you allege, had falen in your country's service, and that you could have claimed it?
Mrs. AUsop hesitated, 'out made no reply, and then said, -I never said that I was the daughter of a general, but the grand-daughter.
Mr. BRouGHTON.-It appears to be true that your husband was a paymaster in the 44th Regiment, and that he was allowed to sell out; but in all the correspondence which has taken place great part of 'which is now before menot a word is said about your sons.-The worthy magistrate here referred to a communacation'which had been forwarded to a friend of Major-General Brooke, in which it was stated that her sons were in the Sappers and Miners, that they were taken prisoners at Alma, and that both escaped to the IFrench camp and were wounded.
Mrs. Allsop.-I never sadd such a thing.
Mr. BROUGHTON.-.-The words were taken down from your own lips, and it is not likely that a general would take down that which was not said. What names did your sons go by in the Crimea ?
Mrs. Allsop.-I do not know.
Mr. BROuGETON.-It is something remarkable that they should be sent for from India to act as clerks. Do you not know the names they went by in the Crimea?
Mr. Allsop.-They wrote to me in the name of AlloOp. Their names were likely changed, for all that I know, when in the Crimea
3fr. BROUGHTON.-You have said that you were at Waterloo ?
Mrs Allsop.-Yes, I was.
M'r. BROUGHETON.-How came you at Waterloo? It appears that you were married in 1816, and the battle of
aterloo took place in 1815; therefore you must have been at Waterloo a year before you were married.
Mrs. Allsop.-I was over all the Peninsula before I was married. At Waterloo I got off the horse on which I was riding to bind up Lord Raglan's wounds.
Mir. BROUGHTON.-Since you were last here I have had letters from Colonel Phipps, who states that he has examined all the letters sent to him by you with a great deal of care, and that no mention has been made in either of them about your sons. Is it at all likely that the Queen, wbo has taken so lively an interest with regard to the sick soldiers, and who has visited them in the hospitals, would have turned a deaf ear to your petitions, or Prince Albert either, if no doubt had existed as to the accuracy of the statement which you put forth? It is extraordinary that no one ever heard of your sons, and since you have been here you r sons never entered the Sappers and Miners.
Mrs. Allsop.-They were to do so, Sir.
Mr. BROUGHTOar.-Did you ever lve in Westminster ?
hirs. Allsop.-Yes, for a short time, near the bridge; but that wasa long while ago.
Mr. BROUGHTON.-Have you had any sons in the Bluecoat School ?
Mrs. Allsop.-Yes, two.
Mr. BROUGrTON.-Through whose interest did you get them there?
Mrs. ADsop.-I don't know,
Mr. BROUGHToN.-I have another letter by me, in which I am informed that the complaint under which you allege you are suffering has no foundation in fact, and that the appearance which your person presents has been got up for thesake of effect.
Mr. Allsop.-Itis nothing of the sort, Sir. I have been under Mr. Fergasson, a surgeon, and he says there is no cure for me. It is a tumour under which I have been suffering.
Mr. BROUGHTON.-From a paper before me it is stated that you have no tumour at alL
Mrs. Allsop.-Send any doctor to me, Sir, whom you may think proper, and I will lie on my bed, and will submit to be examined. I have been shown up in the papers as an
hitor. NI have received a still more extra-
ordinary account of you, to the effect that you are not a woman, but a man in disguise.
Ms. Allsop.-There is a God above who knows all.
Mr. BROUGHTON.-YOU have stated that Lord Raglan sent you 51. ?
MrAllsop.-He did so.
Mr. BROUGHTON.-What did you do with the note?
Mrs. Allsop.-My landlady changed it for me. She did not see the letter in which it was enclosed.
Mr. BROUG1ITON.-Is your landlady present? Mr Allsop.-She is not, Sir.
Mr. BRoUGHToN.-The Mendicity Society's report in reference to your case is terribly against yon.
Mrs. AlIsop (apparently affected).-Mrs. Douglas, of nut~ford-place, with whom I had lodged, could tell you, if she 'was here, that I have repeatedly sat down and cried on account of the death of my poor boys.
Mr. Franklin, who had been sent to the residence of Lady Thesiger, here arrived, and said that her Ladyship was out
Mr. BROUGHTON.-IaVe you not had an allowance from some persons in Scotland?
Mrs. Allsop.-Yes, Sir.
M1r. BROUGrTON.-From 'whom?
Mrs. Allsop.-Fromtwo Duchesses and two Dukes. I have lost many fnends since this inquiry.
MrW BPaOUGETON"-Did yon ever adopt the name of "Windeape7f"
Mrs. Allsop.-I have.
Mr. Franklin here showed Mrs. Allsop a letter, signed nWindeape Allsop," and asked her if that was her handMrs. AlIsop looked at the letter, and said she had not her pectacles and could not state if it was in her handwriting or not.
MIr. Franklin, 'who has greatly exerted himself in the case, here, in reference to some allusions to her sons in the letter he produced, asked Mrs. AUsop under what name her sons were admitted into the Bluecoat School?
Mrs. Alsop replied that she did not know.
MIr. BROUGHTON.-If you do not know in what names your boys got into the Bluecoat School we cannot get any information as to whether your boys were in there or not. You say that your sons were employed in the Crimea as clerks, and in the office of Lord Raglan ?
Mrs. Allop.-Yes, Sin
Mr. BROUGosTON.-I will not detain you any longer. I will write to the private secretary of the sate Lord Raglan, and also to Lady Thesige, in reference to his paper having been filled up by her.
The inquiry excited a great deal of interest.
" Fred' has sentthe first haf of a 51.-note, and "Alice ree" '5s. in stamr3, for tho poor-box of the court. I
WORSEUn-STRMr--Mr. John Walker, a ha'oerdasher in Shaftesbury.street, New North-road, was charged, on final examination, by the parish authorities of Sboreditch with ill-using his orphan niece, a child eight years old.
Mr. D'EmC aT- said he did not think that the evidence adduced was sufficient to support an indictment for the offence with which the defendant was cbarged, and, moreover, it was one of those cases which Iord Campbell's Act did not provide for, and there was no one to pay the costs of a p tion, unless the parish chose to meet t .The defendant had stinted the child, allowing it to get into a bad state, its tces all running together, as described, whih was abominable cruelty; asid he did not hesitate to say that the man deserved puni4hment for it but, after the medical evidence now given, he did not thmk that an indictment could stand, and it was just one of those cases that he could not punish summarily. It was entirely now for the parish to exercise their judgment, and
if they could fix upon any certain date -when an assault upon her had been committed, they could, of course, indict the defendant for it; as it was, he must be discharged; "but" (added the mnagistrate, addressing the defendant) "it does appear to me that you have treated this poor child with great cruelty."
The defendant was then liberated, and Mr. Bagley, the overseer, engaged to make a full representation of the case to the board of guardians, that they might determine as to an ultimate prosecution upon another charge.
CLER5EtNVELL.-A respectably dressed voung woman, of ladylike appearance, was placed at the bar on remand, charged with stealing a 51.-note and a check for 31. 12s., the property of Henry James Biokley, who stated that he was a drysalter, residing at 13, Coomb-street, Macclesfieldstreet, City-road.
Mr. Beard, from the office of Mr. Buchanan, attended for the prisoner.
It appeared from the evidence that some time since the complanant was lying very ill in bed and was bein attended by a woman whom he had been living with. This wfoman, it seemed, the prisoner went to see, and while there, according to his statement, she took down his great-coat, took out his pocketbook, and stole the 51.-note and the check. The note he had had in his possession for some months, and the check was given him by a gentleman, whom, although a remand had been granted, he was now unable to produce. He did not caU out at the time, because he was very ill.
Mr. Beard.-WiU you have the kindness to tell me-
WTitnes-I inam not going to answer you, or eIse, perhaps, you will find it out.
Mr. Beard.-How many persons have you charged with felony ?
Witness.-I am not going to answer you.
Mr. Beard.-Answer my question !-How many times have you charged persons with felony?9
Witness, after bandying with the question, and being cautioned by',th magistrate, said,-Perhaps once.
MIr. Beard.-Have you not done so more than tvice ?
Witnes6.-Weil, you know; perhaps it might have been
Mr. Beard.-Or three times? Now, tell me if the parties you charged were not discharged?
Witness.-They were.
Mr. Beard.-Now, we will just take a glance at your character. Were you not charged with stealing some tar. pauling?
Witness.-No, I was not.
Mr. Beard.-What were you charged with? Witness.-Nothing.
Mr. Beard.-Tell me whether you were not charged with receiving some tarpa?ling?
Witne..-Why, yes, was indicted for receiving some tarpaulings, but I was acquitted on that charge.
Mr. Beard.-And also some drugs?
Witness.-Yes; that was at the Criminal Court. Mr. Beard.-What are you by trade?
Witness.-That is my business. Your not a respechble Eolicitor. You are a thief, and you keep a prostitute.
Mfr. TYRwHv.-Such language as that will not do here. You must conduct yourself with propriety at this court.
Mr. Beard.-Do you not buy forged and stolen notes ?
Witness.-Perhaps you know best about that. I am not going to answer, because I am as clever as you.
Mr. Beard.-Do you give 31. for a 51-note ? Witness (after some hesitation).-No. Mr. Beard.-Nor 81. for a 101.-note?
The witness here became very abusive, and did not wish to answer the question, but afterwards said " No."
A witness the landlady of the house, was called by the prosecutor, but she shted that on the night in question she saw the purse in the hands of the woman who was living with theprosecutor.
Mr. Beard said his client was a most respectable person, and he asked his worship to dismiss the case with such remarks that she might leave the court without a stain upon her character. It was of no use cross-examining the prosecutor further, for he was determined to give a negative to all that was asked of him.
Mr. TYRWHITT discharged the prisoner, and said she left the court without a stain upon her character. He quite concurred with the remarks of Mr. Beard.
The prosecutor here got into the box to ask a question, When
Mr. TiRwurTr said,-I have had quite enough of such a fellow as you. Get away with you.
"W. H." has sent 10s. for the poor-box.
THAs.-Wllljam Darley, a boy about 13 years of age, and dwelling with his mother at No. 8, Star-street, Commercial-road East, was brought before Mr. YARDLEY charged with stealing a 501. Bank of England note, No. 37,974; and Morris Lipman, a Jew, aged 29, and described as a general dealer of Petticoat-lane, Whitechapel, was chargead with feloniously receiving the note,ho well'knowing it togbe stolen.
Anm Darley, the wife of a seaman and mother of the younger prisoner, whose ev idence was very indistinct and confused, said her husband was at sea. She had lately come into a legacy. She was in possession of a 501note, and put it under her pilow on her bed for safety. Her son knew where the note was deposited. On Monday week she saw the note safe under her piUow. She had occasion to leave her room for some time, and when she returned the note was gone. Herboy wasalso missing, but she did not then suspect him. en he came home the same night ho had some money, and she asked him where he had been, and he said he had been at work. On Tuesda, the day after the note was lost, she asked blm where the note was, and he said he sold it to a Jew on the 'Change (meaning the Clothes-Exchange in Houndsditchb for 21.; ase went with her son there, and he pointed out the prisoner Lipman, and he was given into custody.
Mr. YARDLEY.-What did the prisoner say?
Mrs. Darley.- He said he never had the note.
Mr. YAIDLxY.-Have you the number of the note?
Mrs. Darley.-Yes, I have, Sir. (The witness handed in the number of the note, and said she had given information of her loss at the Bank of England.)
William Sharp, a very intelligent boy, about 14 years of age, who, from the manner in which he gave his evidence, bhas associated with thieves, said he lived at No. 9, Star. street. On Monday week he went to the 'Change vith the prisoner Darley to sell a bit of flimsy (banlmote). It was a o01. Bank of England note.
Mr. YABtDLEY.-HOW do you know that?
Witness.-I read it, Sir. I know what a banknote is. Mr. YARDLXY.-What did it say?
Witness-This was it, Sir:-"I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of 501. For the Governor and Company of the Bank of England." I said to Darley, "Why, it is a 5--note," and he said, " Get out, ou fool
it's only a U..note." I said, "I know better; {t's 50g1n Well, then we went to the 'Change, and sawa chap they call Buffalo, and Joe the Leader, and they werejoined by the Jew Lipman. They all went to a beershop in Devonshire-square, Houndsditch, and when they came out again Darley showed me 30s. in gold and some silver, and he gave the Buffalo 5s,
Mr. YARiDLEY.-Are you sure the prisoner Lipman is one of the persons who want into the beershop with the other prisoner?
Witnese.-Yes, I am, Sir. Darley said the Jew gave him 21. for the 5Oh-note. I met the Buffalo yesterday again, and he said, " Is there anything else up ." audI said, Yes, there's another note for sale." He said he would buy the note, and I asked him to come along with me. That was done to catch him, but it was no go, and he got away from me.
In cross-examination by Mr. Charles Young, for the prisoner Lipman, the witness said he received 1s. only out of the proceeds of the note. He was not in regular practice as athief. When he was upon 'Change in Houndsditch Joseph Eagle passed him and Darlev, and said, " Have you
agsaes."
Mr. YARDLEY.-Stakes ! What does that mean? Witness.---Stolen handkerchiefs, your worship.
In further cross-examination by Mr. Young, Sharp went on as follows:-"I can swear to Lipey, the Jew. EHe and the Buffalo and the Leader were all together. I have been on 'Change once since the note -as stolen. Insked Darley where he got the note, and he said he dipped a sailor of it."
M1r. YA".DLEY.-What did you understand by that?
Sharp.-Wby. picked a sailor's pocket of it, and then I thought it was all right.
Mr. YARnDLY said the witness Sharp seemed too familiar with crime, and this case afforded p roof that the boy had a most melancholyfamiliarity with tbe lraseology of tbieves. It was a painful case altogether, and, without Saying any thing to the prejudice of either risoner, he did hope that the greatest possible pains womd be taken with the case, and that it would be well sifted; and he also hoped every effort would be made to trace the 501.-note. He renanded the prisoners for a week.
Mr. Young.-Will you not admit Lipman to bail, Sii?
Mir. YARDLEY (emphatically).-No, I will not take bail, Mr. Young.
hlr. YARDLEY has received the first half of a U.-note from " Fred" for the poor-box, with an intimation that the second half would be forwarded on the safe arrival of the first portion being noticed in Vie Times.
LAXsErr.-Cook, the gaoler, made a second coml laint to Mr. ELLiOTT of the new and absurd regulations re" ectin the prison van, by which five out of 12 prisoners ho ha
been committed to the Wandsworth House of Corre( tion on the day before had been left in the cells all night. Cook said that on Monday night there were 13 prLsoners left in the cells all night, some of whom had been tal-en into custody on the Saturday night, so that t hey had bef n detained 4ue uo- of-1 satu ih,Sna n udyngt
tbe whole of Saturasy -nigh't-, Sun-d-y-'n"d--Sur,'d-ay- ni-ght', Monday and Monday night, the only interval of their not being locked up in a cell being the time their cases were being heard. On the night before (Tuesday) the van was only able to take seven out of 12 prisoners, and the rest were left in the cell aU night.
Mr. ELLIOTT observed that such a state of things could not be allowed to exist, and at once forwarded a letter on the subject to the Pohce Commissionerm

Mr. Baron Martin and Mr. Justice Crompton arrived in this town yesterday afternoon from Appleby, and immediately proceeded to open the commission, after which they attended Divine service at the cathedral.
CROWN 00VRT.sBr-(Bfe Mr. Baron MARTIN.)
John Jackson,.aged 34, was indicted for uttering a forged U1. Bank of Engknd note at Wigton on tIro 28th of January last, well knowing the same to be forged.
Mr. Overeni,.Q.C., arld tho Hon. -Mr. Liddell appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Campbell-Foster for the defence.
It appeared f&om the statement of-the learned coansel for the prosecution, and from the witnesmes called in support of it, that the prisoner went to Wigton on the 2Sth of January last, and called at half-past. 7 o'clock at a grocer's ohop keptby a woman named Grace- Qraham, and, after purchasing a small quantity of tea, tendered in payment a 61. Bsnk of Englaud note, and Mrs. Graham, being unable to give him the change herself, took it to a neighbour, Mrs. Uanderson, the landlady of the Crown and Mitre, who gave her the change, and she then returned to her shop and gave the prisoner the amount of tho note, less 2s. 4d., the price of the tea, observing at thc same time to him, " I suppose the note is a good one.; I am rather timid ;' to which the prisoner replied, `(}h yes, I wish you had plenty of them." The prisoner than left with the tea, and
rs. Graham,, stiR having some doubts as to the goodness of the note, rotumed to her friend Mrs. Sanderson and obtained the note for the purpose of'showing it to Mr. Messenger, the agent of the Cumberland Bank, and he at once pronounoed the note to be a spurions one. Upon this she gave infornmtion to the poliose,.-nd about 10 'clock the same night a constable came to her and said that a man had been applying for a bed at the Queen's Head Inn, and upon going there with the constable she at once identified the prisoner as the man who had changed the note. Mrs Graham then charged bim with having given her a bad note, and the eonstable, haV1ngtaken him into custody, searched him and found the ,paokage of tea whioh the prisoner had purchased at the shop and about 101. 4s. in mnoney.
This was the evidence in support of tho indictment, and, in order to sustain the charge of.guilty knowledge in uttering the note, *the learned counsel on behalf of the prosecution proved that the prisoner had uttered other forged notes, and called mrs. Biglands, an -innkesper at Thursby, who said that the prisoner came to -her house on the 28th of January, about I o'clock in the day, and baving had some gin, and after that some tea, asked her -to change a 51. Bank of lEngland note for him, whioh sbe did, and rested quite satisfied of its genuineness until the superintendent of the police c-alled upon 3her, when, after makimtgfurther inquiry, she discovered that the r,ote wvas a bad one. Another person, named Wilkison, then pWoved that on the 26th of September last -he was procceding to Aiston fair with two bullocks, when he met the prisoner, who accosted him by asking who ewned the beosts, and upon his telling him that they wwer his father's, and that he was taking them to the fair, the prisoner offered to,purchase them, and even tualy agreed to take them for 91. 12s. 6d., and handed the witness two al. Bank of England notes, receiving three halfcrowns by way of change. At thifs momont Wilkinson's father overtook them, and he confirmed the evidence of his son, and added that upon asking the prisoner whether he intended to wvinter them he replied by saying that he was buying for a friend who intended to do so, tlhough it was Erove that immediately after the purchase he sold the two
ullocks in question to a man named Yeats for 41. The notes given to Wilkinson were also brd notes. AnLother instance was then deposed to, where the prisoner had bought a few pounds of cheese of a person named Melville, *vho kept a email shop in Carlisle, and here again he paid for the cheese with a forged 51.-note, and, upon being compared with the others, they were evidently all made from the same plate.
These facts having all been abundantly proved against the prisoner,
Mr. C,tFPBELL FOSTERx made an urgent appeal on behalf of the prisoner, who he suggested might have been an innocent agcut in the hands of some designing person, and had possibly been imposed upon hy the appearance of the notes in the same way that the other partles had. He insisted that the circumstances under which the notes had been passed away were all excplainable and consistent with the innocence of the prisoner, whose former position as a respectable farmer hardly wrarranted the belif of his being such a designing person as the prosecutor would make him appear to bcj
The learned JUDGE having summed up,
The jury, after a short deliberation, found the prisoner 4Guilty.
Mr. Baron LtRTINr, in passing sentence, told the prisoner that he had been found guilty upon the clearest evidence of a crime which was, in his opinion, one of a very heinous character, and one also that the judges had determined to put down. He understood that the prisoner had confessed to Mr. Freshfield that he had obtained the notes from Newcastle; but that made no difference in his mind. He believed that in this ease the prisonier was one of those persons who, for a very small sum, purchased these spurious notes knowing them to be such, and uttered them throughout the country.
The sentence of the Court was that he be transported for the term of 15 years.
CIVIL COURT.-(Bcfore Mt%. Jtnstice COoMrToX.)
BROTIIERTON AND ANOTIiER V. SHERWIN.
Mr. S. Temple, Q.C., and btr. Heath appeared for the plaintiffs; ana fr. Edward James, Q.C., and Mr. Brett for the defendant.
Mtr. TEAIPLE, for the plaintiffs, stated that this was an action brought by the plaintiffs, who were contrsators, against the defendant, as the secretary to the trustees of the *Whitehaven and Egremont turnpike roads. The trast, in consequenceof thegreatincreaseof thetraffioin theminerals which are brought in carts from Cleator to Whitehaven had become wealthy, and the trustees had resolved to expend the money for the benefit of the public in lowering a dlifficult hill, called Clint's Brow. The plaintiffs had sent in the lowest tender, which was accepted, and had carried on the work for some time. They alleged that they had been delayed by the surveyor of the trustees, and that they had under his directions done far more work than was contemplated in their original contract, and -were on both grounds entitled to a sum greater than the contract price of the work.
After a long examination of the plaintiff Brotherton in support of his claim, the case was referred.
South Wales Circuit.
SOUTH WALES CIRCUIT.
SWANSEA. TFFR 9A
T'he commission for this county was opened yesterday by Mr. Baron Watson. The business commenced at )10 o'clock this morning, and in the course of his charge to the grand jury his LoBsusnxr remarked that he had fixed ten days for the assizes, because many complaints had been made that cases which had been brought to the assizes had not been heard on account of the shortness of time allowed. He had also appointed the civil business to commence on Tuesday next, in order that those parties who brought their cases to the assizes at great cost might know exactly when they would be required. It was a great scandal to public justice that such arrrangement should not be made, and in future he should endeavour to do so. The appearance of the calendar was truly appalling, for out of the names of 26 prisoners no less than 13 were charged with homicide
and some with offenoes equally bad. One case appeared | to be purely accidental, and not arising from the inimorality or the depravity of the people. The worst cases appeared to be those m which a man named ltegan was charged with an attempt to murder his wife, and that in which a man named Lewis was charged with the murder of his wife. Aluding to the case in which Han owv, a superintendent of railway police, was charged with manslaughter, his Lordship said he did not think there would be any negligence proved, because it appeared to be the fault of the driver of the engine himself; and referring to the unfortunate explosion at the Cymmrey Colliery (fully reported in 7Vc TIMes at the time) he said that there were five persons charged with the offence,-namely, Jabez Thonias, the general manager of the mine, Rowland Rowland, overman, and three firemen. The case had been fuUy inquired into by the coroner at the time for 13 or 14 days in the midst of great excitement, and it resulted in a verdict of manslaughter against the prisoners. lIe remarked upon the difference between criminal and coroners' jurliee, and said that he had gone through all the evidenre, and had .ever found greater dticulty in his life, o mUCh so that'he could not rise from the reading of those depositions and consciencicusly say that there was any evidence against the prisonlers. The ju.ry would have to do three things. First, they would have to find out; the duty of the prisoners; sieondly, whether they had been guilty of a want of duty; and, third-ly, whether that~ want of dnty had been the direct and minle. diate cause of death. He then explaired to the
Juiry the law mn such cases, and, after advising thefm to con-: aider the bill in this case after they had finished the rest, concluded with sonic general remarks.
In order to ancommodate aU parties, and to prevent as: much disappointment as possible, his LORDS212P announced that he should Pot sit later tban 6 oclock each evening, commencing at 9 e'clock in the mnorning. This arrangement ha:igiven great satisfaction.
CORN MEASURES.-We mentioned in The Times
COR,N TEASLt-Bs.-We mentioned in The Times a few days ago the reulits of certain meetings held at Wolverhampton and Glocester with the object of eqealiiing the 'weight of corn per brshel sold in the several markets of the kingdom. A petition ias since been got up to the House of Commons by a number of landowvners, merchants, farmers, nillers, amI o'hers intereated in the corn trade in the county of Glocester, pointing out the inconvenience and detriment to the producer and consumer of corn by the diversitv.of weights andl measures by -which corn iF bougit and sold in .di eIent localities throughout the kingdom. The petihioners zllege that if an xniforns imperial -neight of the difterentkinds oiograin were4.nade compulsory, and siubstituted for imperial measure, it " would greatly facilitate the collection of .retr,rns Xor aver4Ces, and simplify the business 4f the farmer as well as that of a great portion of the trading.community." Me petitioners consider the propovitionof lr. ,. Iavies of znixing up the subject with
ec:mal wright or coinage likelg to obstruct, delay, and perhaps rexder abortive a feasible and useful mneasure; and they sugeat that the weight fized should approxinazte as nearly au.possible the avecage of imuperial measure, as the alteration would then in no way kite, fere with arrange. monts as to tithes, rents, &o., the detais of which are dependenton the priceof grain they also express a hope that the fubject mnay receive the earliest convenient attention on the part of the Legialatume, so thidi the prblic may in fiture be able to see at aglance, without ageries of calculations and comparisons, the contents and value of a busraal or quarter of grain.

Xlhe directors of this company have just issued their report. It states that the total amount of share and inortBage eapital chargeable on revenue for the half-year ending the 31st of December last, excluding leased lines, is 12,832,8471., including 3,30)1,6101. on loans, and 791,0401. guaranteed 6 per cent. stock. The expenditure on capital account during the half-year amounted to 103,5881. The increase in the traffic, which occasionally has exceeded the company's power to move it, has necessitated the provision of nmeresed accommodation in the shape of engines, carriages, and waggons. During the half-year the company has had to move 185,000 tons of minerals and 156,000 tons of goods more than in the corresponding half-year of 1855. The expenditure on capital account on the 31st of December last exceeds the amount received by 105,8431. The balance of capital not yet raised amounts to 1,508,5641., but this amount is so circumstanced as not to be available for calls in itp present osition, 197,0541. of it being West Riding capital, and 484,4401. F share capital; the remainder, comprsing forfeited, merged, and surrendered shares in the hands of the company, it is now proposed to deal with, The sanction of the shareholders will be asked to the issuing of 87,500 91. shares, being in the proportion of one share to each 1001. of ordinary paid-up capital. When the shares now to be reissued become forfeited, or surrendered to the company, calls had been received upon them to the amount of 89,0621., which also was. forfeited. It is proposed to appropriate so much of this sulm as will equal 11. per share on the 87,500 shares, and which will be considered as paid up upon them, leaving 81. to caUed for; a first call of 21. per share is contemplated to become due in April. The receipts on the Lancashire and Yorkshire line proper amounted to 592,1801. against 542,2941. at the corresponding period of 1855, showing an increase of 40,886., and the exoenses to 224,1424 against 212,7181., showing an increase of 11,4241. The increase in the number of passengers conveyed was 91 per cent., and in the miles traveUed 8i, per cent. The working expenses have been reduced to 40 per cent, as compared with 414 per cent. in 1855. The earnings per train mile have been-for goods 8s. 2d., and for passengers 4s. 81d. per mile. The balance of revenue applicable to interest and dividend and other fixed charges is 367,.5461. It is recommended that a dividend, at the rate of .5 per cent, per annum, less income-tax, be declared, adding 3,3294 to the surplus, making the amount 10,0591. to be carried forward. Application will be made to Parliament next year for the proposed amalgamation with the East Lancashire Company. The capital account shows that 13,069,6511. had been expended, and 12,9G3,8071. received, leaving a balance against the company of 105,8431.
NORFOLK,
The half-yearly accounts of this railway state that the total amount of capital received has been 2,228,0301., and the total expenditure 2,218,6291., leaving a balance of 9,4001. The sum received from the Eastern Counties Company, as one-seventh of the net profits of the Eastern Counties, Norfolk, and Eastern Union lines, after deducting 46 per cent. for working expenses, has been 49,0741.; and to this must be added 13,142., the balance of the last accoint, and 4561. interest on balances, making a total of 62,6551. The last dividend of 14. 5s, on the 1001. consolidated stock absorbed 12,3931., and after paying 1,8701., the interest on the mortgage debt, 26,3961. dividends on the 4 per cent. debentures, 5 percent. extension stock, 54 per cent. stock, Lowestoft 4 per cent. stock, and 6 per cent. stock, Waveney Valley 5 per cent. stock, and new 5 per cent, shares, and 8124. directors' and auditors' fees, saares, office and law charges, there now remains a balance available for dividend of 21,1821. The dividend on the ordinary 1004. stock will therefore be 24 for the half-year, or at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum.
AMBERGATE, NOTTINGHAM, AND BOSTON.
The report of the directors states that they hope to be able to put the Great Northern Company into possession of the extension line and station buildings in Nottingham in the month of April next. The traffic for the half-year ending the 31st of December amounted to 11,4321., and for the corresponding period of 1855 to 12,2311., showing a decrease of 7991. The increase in the net revenue of the canals amounts to 5341. The directors recommend a dividend of 2s. 8d. per share, free of income-tax, which with the dividend declared in August last is equivalent to 31 per cent. on the active capital of the compaRy, leaving 9711 for next account. The call of 17s. 6d. per share will become payable at the end of next month, and the directors hope that by providing for the liquidation of a portion of thel173,7aOL. debenture bends, issued to canal proprietors, faling due in October next they will be enabled to renew the remainder without making surther caUs on the proprietors, thus leaving the amount of the shares at 101. each.
The capitalaccount showed that 797,42S, had been expended to the 31st of December.
LP,EDS, BRADFORD, AND HALIFAX JUNCTION.
The report states that the revenue account shows an increase of 1,5971. over that of the corresponding quarter of 1855, and that the increase arises chiefly from coal traffic.

The report of the directors states that since the last meeting agreat improvement has taken place in the financial position of the company. The works between Strood and Faversham have advanced rapidly, and there is no reason to doubt that the line wiU be opened to Faversham in September next. Arrears of calls amounting to nearly 40,0001. have been received during the ha-year ending the 31st of December, and to the amonnt of 113,0001. on the original capital. Since that period a further sum of 50,0001. has been received, making a total of 163,0001., which, added to the 200,0001. received up to the 30th of June last, gives 363,0001., or more than half the original capital of the commyan, which wiU authorize the company to borrow

The CQau4iRsmS regretted that they were unable to declare a larger dividend, but stated that the traffic account for the half-gearshowed ade"cit of only 1001. on the receipts of the corresponding half.year of 1855. The decrease had chiefly arisen fromn the diversion of the carriage of Scotch pig iron and hematite in consequence of the war, but it was now returning. He alluded to the proposed branch to the bay, and attributed the failure of the negotiations to the great influence which the London and North-Western directors exercised over the Lancaster and Carlisle board, but expressed a hope that they would be enabled to procure the Act notwithstanding the opposition, and also powers to coN1el the lines forming the "1octople " alliance to carry tr c to an frm the North-Wesam line with the same facility aLnd rates as from their own lines.

NORTH AND SOUTH-WESTERT JIUNCTION,
The half-yearly meeting of this compAny was held yesterd y at the office, Eu8ton station; Mir. H Tootal in the cnair.
Mr. H. Chubb, the secretary, read the report, which sta.ted that in consequence of the increased returns fro . coal traffic, while there has also been a steady improvement in the receipts from the passenger traffic, the direcors have the pleasure of recommending that the dividend for the six months ending the 31st of December last be increased from the rate of a to that of 5o per cent. per annum. After deducting the interest on the debenture debt the available balance amounts to 1,9741., which wiU admit of the paymnent of the dividend and leave 1881. In anticipation of Ithe completion of the Hammersmith branch, the directors
have secured for it the advantage of a considerable coal traffic. The c^aital account showed that 81,0731. had been received and ,4941. expended, leaving a balance of 5791. On account of the Hammersmith branch 14,5724 had been received and 15,8891. expended, leaving a balance against the company of 1,3171. The revenue account showed that 3,2981. had been received and 1,1621. expended, leaving 2,1361.
The Cii R , in moving the adoption of the report, said the present was the largest dividend they had ever declared, and confirmed the views of the directors as to the solidity of the property. The Hammeremith branch would soon be opened for goods traffic. The Queen had patronized their line in travelling from theGreat Northern Railway to Windsor. The arrangements reflected great credit on Mr. Chubb, their manager.
In reply to a question, it was stated that the London and South-Western Company could not make arrangements with the company for the Windsor traffic until they could meet the trains on the Kew and Brentford hne with punctuality, which could not be done till the new line was completed from Camden to Wilesden, which would be in about nine months.
Resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring a dividend of 5s. 6d. per 101. share for the half-year, and forfeiting a number of shares for non-payment of calls.
The retring directors, Mr. R. Creed and Mr. Hill, were re-elected, and also hr. Durham, the retiring auditor.
A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings.
THAZES HAVEN.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the offices, Royal Exchange-buildings, Mr. Loowden in the chair.
The report stated that the pressure on the money-market had rendered it unadvisable for the directors to enter into contracts which would have necessitated speedy cals on the shareholders. They trust that in the course of a short time circumnstances will enable them to carry out those plans already approved by the shareholders, and which they believe wiU result in great benefit to the company. The accounts showed a balance in hand of 5961.
On the motion of the CRAIRSMAN, the report was adopted, Mr. West and Mr. Whitiur, the retiring directors, were re-elected, and also Mr. Whetham, the retiring auditor. Regret was expressed at the retirement of Mr. R. B. Wingfield, and thanks were voted to him for his past exertions to promote the interests of the company.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman.
WEST CORNWALL.
The half-yearly meeting was held yesterday at Brietol, Mr. L. Vigurs in the chair.
The capital account showed that 515,0891. had been received and 515,2221. expended, leaving a balance of 1331. against capital. The revenue account showed the total receipts during the past half-year amounted to 14,9041., and the total disbursements to 9,4191., leaving a balance of profit of 5,4851.
The report stated that there had not been that gradual developement of traffic which was observable on most other railways, and which was attributable, in the opinion of the board, to the continued isolated position of the line. The decrease in the gross receipts had been altogether on the mineral traffic, consequent on the produce of the mines immediately adjacent to the line of railway having been much less during 1856 thani 1855. This cause the directors trust may be only temporary, and they expect to add a new feature to the inineral traflic when arrangements now in progress are completed for shipping copper ore from and landing coal on the company's wharf at Truro. The directors considered it would be higliy injudicious to declare any (livideild out of the balance of profit for the last half-year, as they believe its retenition in hand would greatly tend to give stability to the credit of the comlpany and increased confidence to the holders of its debentures.
The CiuRst.)iA2 moved the adoption of the report, and went over the various topics alluded to in that document.
Mr. H. 0. WELLS seconded the motion. In reply to questions,
The CHAIaWIAN stated that the balance due from capital to revenue had been reduced to 1,3961. Preparations were making for giving additional accommodation to the mineral traffic at Truro.
In reply to Mr. Leonard and Mr. Jove, Mr. Smith, also a director of the Cornwail Railway, stated that he saw no reason why at the end of the next year the Cornwall Railway might not be opened. As to the opening of a portion of the line at an earlier period he hardly thought that would be done, unless the broad gauge were laid down on the West Cornwall. Whether that were done or not, he believed that by the end of next year the line through from Bristol to Penzance would be opened without let or hindrance, and that a considerable increase of traffic would accrue to this company.
The report was then adopted.
3. GUixRNEY liaving suggested the propriety of electing a paid managing director.
The CEaRisiNio said that the subject siould have the consideration of the Board.
The retiring directors were then re-elected. Mr. Pike was elected auditor in the room of Mr. Turnbull, resigned.
A vote of thanks to the Chairman anddirectors terminated the proceedings.
NORTH DEVON.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the offices, Grebsham-house, Old Broad-street; Mr. W. 'Eitc, M.P., ini the chair.
The report congratulated the shareholders on the settlement of aUi matters in relation to the construction of the line, the stations, sidings, and other works, as between contractor and lessee and the company, by the final award of the chairman, to whom both parties had agreed to leave all matters in dispute; and also that the balance due to the contractor had been ftty paid. The board had recorded a cordial vote of thanks to Mr. Tite, the chairman, fordhis unwearied attention in investigating the claims of the contractor, and for his lberality in making the award without any charge to the company. The traffic of the hne is eradually developing itself. For the first six months endimg June, 1855, it amounted to 7,6951. ; for the second six mouths ending 31st of December to 10,2921. ; the first six months in 1856 to 10,1371. ; and for the sLX months ending December last to 12,5301. The sum applicable to dividend for the half-year is 2,7511, which wiU allow of dividends at the rate of 1l per cent. per annum on the ordinary stock, 2A per cent. on the B stock. and 6 per cent. per annum on-the preference stock and shares. The debenture debt has been reduced from 144,8001. to 128,0001. The capital account showed that 490,0211. had been received and 490,8301. expended, leaving a balance against the company of 8081. The net revenue account for thie half-year showed that 6,0G31. had been received from the lessee and 4791. expended, leaving a balance of 5,5841., to which was added 931. fr,m the precedingaccount, making 5,6771.
On the motion of the CH1AITN, resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring the dividends, confirming the election of Mr. D. Warren and Captain Johnstone, and reelecting the retiring directors and auditor.
A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings.
BIDEFORD EXTENSION.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the offices, Old Broad-street, Mr. G. Braginton in the chair.
The report stated that the railway had been completed and opened for traffic for more than a twelvemouth, and bids fair to be remunerative. The directors are obliged to apply the rent received from 3fr. Brassey to the payment of debts instead of the payment of dividends. The original estimate for the line was 50,0001., and Mr. Brassey undertook to lease the line at 4A per cent. for seven years, from August. 1854. Owing to the opposition of Mr. Buck, a landowner, the borrowing powers of the company were reducedl to 10,0001., and the directors had therefore only 47,3501. upon which they could rely, hut they bad the promiise of M1r. Buck to two provisional directors that the value of his land wouldlbe takeninshsares,anditwasunderstodthiat Vhe whole or the greater part of the Instow lands would be p-aid for in a similar manner, and as those two interests were the most important of the land claimis they resolked to proceed, signed thie contract with Mr. Brassey, and-went on.

EDINBURGH AND GLAS9G,W.
On Tuesday the ordinary half-yearly mseeting of this. company was held in Glasgow, Mr P eter DJOAMcun m,. in the chair. The report being held as read,
BBThe CHAm.rMAz;, in moving the adoption osf the report,; sid there was a considerable increwa in the reagigpta, mostly on the passenger traiffic, andt reso3stirig from Qj~e present inodorato fkaies1 Th9 increas QA AD~ ceiptq from tho
goods traffic was not so large, owing to the many bargains made in times of competition which had yet to be wrought out. Bnt, as these were nearly at an end, they might hope that in fature their increase, especially in the goods traffic, would be greater than ever. At the same time, there had been a fair decrease on the working expenses, mostly oring to the decrease of the mileage ran , and he hopd they wold not only be able to maintain that decrease, but to reduce it stil further. By means of the new works at Cowlairs, work for the company would be done at a much lower rate, and when the Helensburgh line was opened, and there was a run over an increased number of miles, without increasing the staff in at all the same proportion, the expense per mile over their own line would be less If it was decided that they were liable to pay on the whole capital of the Stirling and Dunfermline, amounting in round numbers to 600.0001., that would be 24,0001. a- year; in which case 12.0001. each half-year would be required instead of 10,4001. There would be arrears in that case; and, in the event of its being so decided, it would be imprudent to divide aU they had at present without leaving a sum sufficient to meet their claims. The directors were acting prudently in recommending that a dividend be declared of 2. per cent. The expenditure on the capital accou nt was the next point, and he hoped that account would be closed within the year. They would have ample capital for all their engagements, and there was no necessity to ask for borrowing powers. He thee moved that the report be received and adopted.
1I. SSwANWACiz protested against the continued litigation against the Stirling and Dunfermline Railway Company, and moved as an amendment on the Chairman's motion:-
*That tbe folowing words be added to it:-' With the exception of so much thereof As implieg the intention of bringing the questions in dispute between this and the Stirling and Ounfermline Railway Company before tbeultimate Court of APPea, course wbichb this meeting disapproves "'
After some observations from shareholders who were also shareholders in the Dwnfermline Company,
Mr. Swanwack's amendment was nut to the vote and carried by a majority of 25 to 11 of theshareholders present, but negatived by aid of the proxies at command of the directors.
The motion for the re-election of the retiring directors was met by an arnendment that the namber of 13 directors be gradualy reduced to 10, and that Mr. Peter Blackburn and Mr. Orr Ewing be not now re-elected. Mr. Hll, the mover of the motion, withdrew it, however, and proposed a substantive resolution to the effect that the directors themselves reduce their number to 10 as opportunity occurred. This motion was unanimously agreed to, and the other formal resolutions were carried snem. con.
The meeting then separated.
LONDONDERRY AND ENNISKILLEN,
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Tuesday, at the office, Coleman-street-buildings, Moorgatestreet, Mr. J. Clay, M.P., in the chair.
M7r. Arthur, the secretary, read the report, an abstract of which appeared in The Ti7nes of Monday.
The CsAutiRAr, in mo ing the adoption of the report, stated that he had heretofore endeavoured to avoid sanguine anticipations of success, and somne fault had been found with the very moderate view bh had taken of their prospects, although, in doing so, he had only stated exactly his own impression as to the probability of success. On the present ozcasion he thought he might congratulate them on the result of the past year. The steady increase of traffic and reduction of expenses were two essential items indicating progress. The report showed that the increase of receipts and reductionof expenses for thehalf-year amounted in roundnumbers to 1,0001. The receipts in the year 1856 showed an increase of 3,9401. over those of 1855; and on going further back and comparing the four last months of 18.54, when the line was opened throughout, with the corresponding fourmonths of 1805, an increase of 29 per cent. was shown, and in the same period of 1856 a considerable increase was sbown over 1855. It was the belief of the directors that the traffic would go on steadily increasing. The first six weeks of the present year showed an increase of 751. a-week, and for the past week of 1201., over the corresponding period of 1836; hut, beyond this increase of receipts and decrease in the percentage of working expenditure they believed that the resources of the line were but very partially developed, and that they might look stiU further for reduction in working expenses. They had made extensive repairs in the locomotive and carriage department, and they had also expended money in reballasting at the Enniskillen end of the line, which would tend to imn rove their position. There was an apparent faUing off in theia passenger traffic, but by makingallowance for the conveyanceofthe troopsand stores in 185o, which amounted to about 1,0001., the ordinary passage traffic actuaUy showed an increase to that amount. He then adverted to suggestions by Mr. Hemming, one of their proprietors, with regard to increasing the number of trains and other things, with a view to increase the traffic. He (tbe chairman), and Mr. Cross, one of the directors, had visited the line, with a view to ascertain the necessity for those alterations; but, after making every inquiry,they found they were not wanted, and they had taken off one of the trains between Omagh and EnniskiUen without injuring the traffic. They had not sufficient trucks, and they were obliged to send special trains for carrying the goods traffic. With regard to EnnisInllen, no town could be better situated for improvement, but the inhabitants did not appear to be aware of their position. The water power was immense, equal to 40,000 horses, and yet there was not a mill on it. By the time the other line from Dandalk entered EnniskhUen he thousht some improvement must take place, as no town in Irelana possessed greater elements of rapid improvement. There was Lough Erne, extending for 25 miles beyond Enniskillen, and there was only one steamboat upon it. The traffic on each side of the lough must be considerable, and it was proposed to form a smaU company to put another boat on it, with a capital of 10,0001., which would be ample. It was of vital importance to the railway that the traffic on the lake, or lough, should be developed by means of steamers, and that the shareholders should subscribe a small sum each to establish the company. He then adverted to the deferred dividends on the preference shares, which would be paid off after the claims of the creditors were satisfied. Although the shareholders would be paid their dividends recommended in the report, the directors would not, under the circumstances of the company, take their dividends at present. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. CROsS seconded the motion.
Mr. LAVErR, a director, explained to Mr. Alderman Wilson that, although the directors did not sign the certificates of shares or stock, yet they could not be stamped by the seal of the company without a director being present,
Mr. HE1nauxG did not see the cause for congratulation mentioned by the chairman. He considered, with regard to the passenger traffic, that to stand still was to retrograde. They proposed to give them 5s. per share, Fwhile at the corresponding period of last year they had given them 6s. per share. As to the 30,0001. of increased capital, that was to meet debts upon which they had already being paying interest. He then went into various items in the accounts, comparg theni with similar items in previous accounts with a view to show that they had not improved matters to any extent.
A long discussion ensued on various matters of detail afterwhich the report was adopted, and the dividends on the 6 per cent. and o per cent. preference shares were declared, in accordance with the recommendation in the report, payable on the 2d of March.
Resolutions were also passed authorizing the directors to create debenture stock to pay off the loan capital of the company, amounting altogether to 150,0001.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors.
NAMUR AND LIEGE, AND MONS AND MANAGE.
A special meeting of this company was held on Ttiesday at the London Tavern for the purpose of considering the propriety of ratifyin- an agreement entered into with the Minister of Pablie works on behalf of the Belgian Government for the transfer to the said Government of the lease of the Mons and Manage Railway, lately agreed upon between this company and the directors of the Northern of France Railway. Captain Parry in the chair.
Mr. Moates, the London agent, read the notice convening the meeting.
The CIIAI WIASr explained that they had agreed to lease the line to the Northern of France Railway from the Ist of January last, but for some reaeon the directors of the latter company had postponed the ratification of it until the general meeting of t e ompany in the present year. In the meantime they were inforned by the Minister of Public Works that the Council of Ministers, after mature deliberation, were compelled with regret to refuse the sanction of the Belgian Government to the pro. posed arrangement. They could easily imagine the uneasiness such a communication caused the directors, the more especially as the Government had been made fully aware of all their proceedings with the Northern of France from the commencement of the transaction, and the directors had every reason to be assured that no impediment on their part would be made to it, the Government having already previously allowed the lease of their Namur and Liege branch. That uneasiness and anxiety were, however, shortly afterwards rehieved by the result of negotiations with the Belgian Government for leasing the line themselves. A convention had been duly signed by the lMinister of Public Works whereby the Belgian Government was to take possession of the lne from the 1st of January last for the remainder of_ the concession, and guarantee the
payment of the identical annual sum named in the company's agreement with the Northern of France. The directors of the latter company, having ascertained from undoubted authority that the decision of the Belgian Government was final and irrevocable, communicated their opinion personally to their board, whose views coincided with the Mons and Manage directorsnamely, that their first duty was to protect tho interests of their own shareholders. recommending them to accept the proposed terms of the Belgian Government, although it was with, eat regret they were obliged to give up their claim. They had done.so accordingly, and certain modifications had been madea, but-he had no hesitation in sta-ing that, looking at the present agreement in all its hearings, more especially with reference to the higher value of a Government security, like that oC the Belgian nation, as compared with that of a private company, however powerful, it would be found equzlly as advantageous to them as the former agreement, and in certain points, perhaps, more so. This armragemert would have to receive the sanction of the Belgian Legislature, a biU having already beea preseuded for the purpose, and thero was no doubt of its receiving unanmous assent. With regard to the modifications, there was no difference in the aunual rental to be paid by the Belgian Government and that g-aaranteed to them in their conrention wIth the Northern of Francoe. The directors of the latter company had, however, after much negotiation, agreed to und,,rtake all the necessay arrangementg and expensee for cars ring on the affairs o tbe corngpany, and by that arrangemeni they were to have been pai the 14f- and 30f. per share they had previouily announced. This private agreement, a,'thouo-h binding between the two boards, formed no part 9f the actual convention, consequently the Mliniter, alth mr4gh much pressed, refused, and he (the Chairman)thought a ith some reason, to take cognizance of it, stating that a lar 'r su-m would have to be asked of thje Cbambern, which' lie was not prepared to do, than that publicly announced in the agreement between the two companies. The directors, in consulting the interests of thei
bhW l94era, yielded the point. The company would hsayg J
the responsibility of receiving and distributing upwards of 66 0001. a-year annually upon which there would be certain fixed charges both in london and Brusels, not less than L,2001. for the first year, to be deducted from the amount received from the Government. and would amount to about 8d.rper share. He, as one of the largest preference sharehol ers, suggested that it W Just and eqitable that the preference anareholders should bear with the other class of shareholders the necessary expenses incurred in the management of the company's affairs. He concluded by moving a formal resolution approving the convention entered into with the Belgian Government for leasingthe line and seDing the plant for a rental of 672,330f. (26,8931) per annum, and authorizing the directors to ratify the same.
Mr. S. HERAPATH wished to know whether in selling the line for the whole of the concession they could not seU it altogether, so that the company should cease to exist; aLnd, although the expenses to the amount of Sd. per share might be borne for one or two years, he thought the continuance of that charge would be objectionable.
Mr. PoPPE, the resident director, explained that the company had.lso to distribute 40,0001. a-year, the rent of the Nainr and Liege line, received from the Northern of France Company, and also tO pay off a certain siumber of debentures every year.
M5 S. HERAPATH thought the Northern of France might do that business for them.
The C:Arm3uc.; had great hopes that those matters might be arranged at less cost than at present. They would have to receive and distribute the money in Brussels, Paris, and London; but the question they had now to decide was whether they would sanction the convention.
After some discussion, in which Mr. Field, Mr. Harrison, Mr. Boyd, and others took part, the resolution was put and carried unanimously.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors
BUFFALO AND LAKE HURON.
A general meeting of shareholders in this company was held at the London Tavern on Monday, Mr. T. W. Powell in the chair.
The report stated that on the 28th of June ssession was obtained of the line and works, and on the 1st of November 81 miles were opened for traffic. The directors expect that the present capital of 410,0001. will suffice for the completion of the ulse from Fort Erie to the limits of the town of Goderich. The receipts and expenditare amounted to 220,4501.
The CiiAiRNuaN, in moving the adoption of the report, stated that the dispute with the old company was now at an end, and that everything connected with the railway was proceeding most satisfactorily. The capital of the company for the first seven years might be estimnated at 1,000,otL, and for that theyhad obtained a railwa 157 miles in ieno h and 100,0001. worth of roUling stock. R~e csofthe ln was about 5,8001. per mile; the parties from whom they had purchased it had lost 250,0001. by the undertaking. The local traffic on the line was excellent, and it would also have % large through tratffic going to the west. The line would be found the best, the shortest, and cheapest communication from the fertile districts of Canada to the United States of America. Their prospects were good, and thev would ultinmately realiae a handsome return for their outtlay.
Captain BABLow, civil engineer, the resident director, explained the position of the line, and the probability of its provig very remunerative when the through and local traffic were developed by extensions and other means.
un the motion of the CIIAIRMAcN the report was adopted; and the proceedings concluded with votes of thanks to Captain Barlow, to the chairman, and the directors.
SUBMARINE TELEGRAPHI COMPANY.
The mneeting of this company was held at the London Tavern yesterday, Sir J. Carmichael in the chair.
The report stated that the anticipated increase in the revenue of the company had been arrested by the unforeseen and suddendecay of the underground wireswhich connect the submarine cables with London. Immediately that the underground system of telegraph between London and Dover was ascertained to be faulty, the BritishTelegraph Companyvoted a large sum of money for the complete re-insulation and renewal. of the whole line, and at the present moment the principal portion of this work had been completed, and the wires uniting London with Paris and Brussels were now in perfect working order. The very serious accident which lately occurred to both their submarine cables, and for a time suspended the telegraphic communication across the Channel, can scarcely be considered as a misfortune to the company, as it has proved the great strength and endurance of these cables, which during a fearful gale, each successively bore the strain, for upwards of an hour, of the anchor of a large and heavily laden ship of 700 tons' burden. It has also shown the ease and rapidity with which any injury to submarine wires in moderate depths can be repaired, even during the most unfavoarable season of the year, and has thus afforded an additional guarantee to the shareholders of the stability an(d permanent value of their property. The able report of Mr. Crampton, the engineer of the company on this subject, Vwill be read with much satisfaction by the shareholdeW. After the deduction of working expenses and 10 per cent. of the net profits for the reserve fund, a balance of 2,9761. remains, out of which the directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent. per annun, leaving 2631. The balance-sheet showed a total of 88,6511., including 80,0001. received on capital account.
Resolutions were unanimonsly passed, adopting the report, declaring the dividend at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum for the past half-year, psyableonthe 12th of March - conveying the thanks of the meeting to the Electric and International Telegraph* Company for the ready manner in which they had granted the use of the MIonarch steamer, a nd adjourning the extraordinary meeting to the 2-5th of
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman and Directors.

Strike At The Birkenhead Dock Works.-
STRIRE AT TIIE BIR1KEXHETAD DoCK WTORKS.- From some cause of disagreement the navvies employed by Messrs. George Thompson and Co., the eminent contractors, in carrying out the works for the deepening of the Great Float, at Birkenhoad, have struck ; butthe inconvenience, the contractors anticipate,will be only temporary, as there is an ample supply of the sort of labour that they require. As usual, there are two versions of the grievance in the case, and they differ from each other as far as the north pole varies from the south in distance. The men state that they have turned out 844 strong, besides which they caused from 300 to 400 men to be thrown out of employment. It seems that until S o'clock on Monday morning these men, the tippers and drivers, worked, hut that afterthe breakfeast half-hour they refused to turn to unless their wages were raised from 2s. Sd. and 2s. 9d. per day, of winter working hours-that is, from daylight in the morning until dark in the evening-to 3s. for the longer day's work, which, as spring approaches, is from 6 to 6, with half an hour for breakfast, and an hour for dinner. They urge, too, that their work is more arduous than that of the platelayers and mechanics, who receive 3s. 4d. a-day. Tho police were obirged to be called into requisition, for on Monday the urnouts compeUed by threats all the men who remained at work to desist; and Inspector Thompson, with two officers, was stationed at the commencement of the works to preserve the peace. Yesterday morning, however, about half-pst 10 o'clooe, 600 of the turnouts came down to the works in A body, and, finding a few men at work, ran after them, but no violence was used, and, after parading the neighbourhood for an hour or so, returned to Birkenhead. The Messrs. Thompson very promptly afforded our reporter any information that he required; and we learn From him that the strike originated in a spirit of dislike by tho Irish navvies to the employment of English labourers, from whom, it is alleged, more wvork could be obtie in a given time than from their babernian brethren, It is stated to us that the strike could barely be on accouit of low wages, for th.t the men employed in the excavations at the Great Float are paid from 3d. to 5d. a- day more than labourers employed in similar works at Crewe; and, moreover, that on Saturday evening last about 200 of the men, frish and English, indiscriminately chosen, received an unexpected addition of Id. per day each to their wages, on the reoommendation of Mr. Merryweather, their overseer, who, as he finds the men deserving of an increase, reports them accordingly to the Messrs. Tbompson; and that. had these misguided men remained at their work instead of striking, they, too, to a great extent, would have participated in a fortnight hence m the good luck of their confr6rcs. The Messrs. Thompson assert thnt only 166 men have struck. There are 78 waggoners employed at the works, and two men for tipping and driving are allotted to each. So extremely necessary is their presence, and co-operation that without them about 1,000 men alld 130 hmses are not able to proceed with their work, and are remaining idle until fresh tippers and drivers shall have been procured. The contractors bave offered to pay each of the turnouts his wages for the hour and a-half that he worked on Monday morning, but they refuse to take the money and demand to be taken back upon their own termis. The Messrs. Thompson reject such overtures, and, carrying out a principle which they have long adopted, refuse to receive into their employment again any man who has gong out on strike. The Englishmen expressed themselves perfectly ready to go to work again if they were protected; and a body of police having been sent up from Birkenhead by Supeintendent Birnic, theso men resumed their labours at
o clook yesterday, but of course some inconvenience vias experienced from the absence of the tippers and drivers. We understand that the Messrs. Thompson have made arrangements for bringing men from their various contrdots in different parts of the country to replace thoso out on strike.-Livcrpool Daily Pout.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOR OF TFHB TIMAES.
Sir,-I have read Captain Vernon's letter, published imr TAhc Tts of the 17th inst.; and as in mino of the 13th I Faid on the subject it refers to all I ever intended to say,. and which, with reference to the proofs brought forward in u upport of what I did say, was assuredly aU that the occasion, required, I now decline entering into any further discussion. of the point beyond saying that my former opinion is entirely unchanged as to General Pollock's having relieved JellalabadL
Iu mny letter of the 13th inst. I said that the sortie on the 7th of April, 1842, was made at my most urgent recommendation, and under my entire arrangement, as the matter was placed in my hands. Yet, in the faeo oE this plain and easily intelligible declaration, Captain. Vernon, with an eas offhand confidence, not a little. remarkable, considering we had not the honour of hin presence, asserts as follows:-" The desperate saUy ordered! by Sale, and commanded by Dennie, wish Monteath second in command, until Dennie was shot." To this I have to. observe that Colonel Dennie was kiled early in ' e day, and long before the termination of the action ; yet lMneverassumed the command of the troops. This very remarkable circnmstance I will alow Captain Vernon to explain to the public as he best can. My own explanation vill begiven in the words of the General Order issued on the occasion by the Governor-General.
" Socret Department, Benares, April 21, 1842.
"That 'illustrious' garrison, which by its constancy in, enduria privationand byitsvalourin action has already obtained for itself the sympathy and respect of every true. soldier, has now, saUying forth under its gallant leader, Major-General Sir Robert Sale," &c.
This I can on my own part assure the public wasz the true and only cause why I did not take upont myself the command of the troops when Colonel Dennie was kiU ed. General Sale went out in command of the troops and returned so to Jellalabad. With reference to other portions of Captain Vernon's letter of the 17th inst., I have no objection to enter into an explanation as to what occurred immediately before the 7th of April, 1842. On the morning of the 6th Mahomed Akbar Khan moved down his guns and his entire force, and drew up in front of Jellalabad, where he fired a Royal salut and a feu de joic, and then gave three cheers, to our amazement; and shortly afterwards contrived to let us know that General Pollock had attempted to force the Kyber Pass, had been repulsed with great loss, and had retreated to Peshawur. As our supply of provisions was on the most reduced scale -was at that time almost exhausted-it was my opinion, and that of the other commanding officers, that the time was come when we ought to do something for ourselves by going out and attacking the enemy, seeing that we had been amused with hopes of relief from the nonth of February up to that time, and that under existing. circumstances all hope seemed entirely to have vanished away; and we went and communicated these sentiments tW General Sae, who positively declined to listen to them, and the party went away; but I continued to press them upon him when they had left, and one of the arguments used by me was, that it was infinitely better for us to go out and dielike men, with swords in our hands, than remain where we were and perish like dogs by starvation. After urging: many difficulties and the desperate nature of the enterprize, I reminded him that the records of history supplied us with examples of many 'esperate undertakings successfully accomplished by desperate exertions; that I myself did not view things in so despairing a light as he did; and that, if we only managed our affairs well, I had good hope of success. H.e then urged some doubts as to the guns being able to pass without obstruction to the enemy's camp; on which I asked him to allow me to send my orderly for Major Abbott, the. ArtiUery officer, and, on his coming and my putting the question as to tho practicability of the road, his reply was, "Only give the order, General Sale, aud have no anxiety about my guns " He then, at length, gave his consent to go out the next morning, and confided the whole management of the matter to me, and I went and commenced the necesssry arrangements immediately, warning all what would be done, and that they must fully make up their minds-that they must return successful, or return no more. Having put everything down on paper I sent the draught tohim, and after alapse of some time he came to my quarters to tell me he approved the arrangements made, and the nexct morning we marched out to ou r
ork, anddid it most completly. Yet Captain Vernon asserts that I was sent out under Colonel Dennie If that had been the alternative I will venture to say we never should have gone out at aU. Before 12 o'clock Jellalabad was surrounded with peoplo from the country with provisions, when we had it in our power to supply ourselves with any quantity we required, and three days' supply would have sufficed for us. Therefore, if General PoUlock had never quitted Peshawur, I wil venture to say I would, after the 8th, have taken the "illustrious" garrison through the lhyber Pass without the loss of ten men. In tact, the thing was simply a bugbear, requiring only experience and tact to overcome,-al ways supposing good troops to be employed. The enemies encountered at Jugdulluck came from Cabul when they heard of our move in that direction, and I found no great difficulty in conquering them, both in going and returning from Cabul, after they had let General Pollock pass; and I believe mine, being the rear column, had more of their attention, as my list of casualties will show, than. his. With respect to General Pollockes so humanely catching no the remnant of the " illustrious" garrison consigned to penance in Jollalabad, all that I know of tho matter is that the "illustrious" constituted Sale's brigade, and were with him The portion so kindly picked up and carried off consisted of a subaltern of the 13th Light Infantry, in charge of the sick, and the effects of the men in advance. The same of the 35th Light Infantry, which probably were duly picked up en passant by their own commanding officers. But, really, parading such a matter in the catalogue of General Pollock's military claims to distinction savours too much of the ludicrous. People have often good cause to exclaim, " Save me froum my fnends !"
I beg to say I decline taking any notice of the letter of your correspondent signed " Vir," ard my correspondencewith Captain Vernon will now cease.

The Irish Priesthood.
THE IBSH PRIESTHOOD.
TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Wil you allowv ne to offer a few observations upon the letter of an " Irish Gentleman" in Tltc Times of yesterday, respecting the ' appalliup disadvantages" arising from the education of the Irish prnesthood at MIaynooth 7~ I do so as a Churchman vho has no sympathies wvith the peculiar tenets of Roinanism, and as having some knowledge of the Irish Roman Catholic clergy, and of the classes from which they are taken.
The view which an "Irish Gentleman" takes of the snbject is not only very limited and incomplete, but his remarks imply an unqualified libel upon his countrymen in general, and upon Irish scholars and professors in particular -namely, that students for the priesthood arc incapable of being " civilized" at home, and that Irishmen are incom-- petent for the task.
Now, it has generaUy been supposed that classical ard liberal studies have a certain humanizing influence even upon the savage and untutored nature of an outer barbarian,. or-shall we say?-of a mere Celt. But, aceording to the dictum of this " Irish Gentleman," it is only when suchstudies have been pursued in A foreign university, and& under the Auspices of a foreign professor, that they can. metamorphose an Irishman into a civilized being, fit tcasgociate with the provincial squierarchy of tho district in which he happens to be stationed. This is somewhata singular-if it be true.
Bat where, it might be asked, did this "Irish Gentlemau'
receive his own education?-where do the vast majority or his countrymen receive theirs ? Not abroad, surely. And yet we may hope that his compatriots aud himself are nob all uncivilized. Oh, ah! but o. course he excepts his own class-tho soi-disaont elite-good society par excellence, but more especiaUy that overweening and arrogant clique ' the Protestant gentry," who are supposed (by themselves) to be the salt of the land.
Blit, after all, what are the special advantages of a foreign education, as compared with that received at home? A, man's ideas, whether he be priest or layman, become somewhat more cosmopolitan ; he speaks French with a betteraccent; he can perhaps make a more graceful bow upon entering a drawingroom, and he cn (if he has been so fortunate as to gain admission to private society during his course), retail small-talk and gossip to the ladies in something of the. off-hand free-and-easy style of the French abbes who told;i funy stones and talked scandal in the saloons of Pompadour and Da Barry.
Now, I think I have stated the advantages fully andl fairly. Do they compensate for the price at which they were gained? i doubt it.
Bat what a humiliating confession it would be for Irishmen to make that their priestlings are such a set of unlicked boors and bogtrotters that they are utterly irreclaimable in their own country, and that their case is desperate unless Frenchmen of their charity bestow uann them the benefit; of their superior " civilization."
Another question, and I have done. Has this "Irisl Gentleman" known many French priests abroad ? has ho conversed with tbem? has he heard them precb i? has hetaken their measure as to their gencral information, attainmnents, and mental caUbre? If he has he must be weIl a6ware that the Irish priesthood, who for the most part, are, the sons of respectable farmers and she keepers, and ar-
not above the arduous duties of their call are in everrespect,-mentally, morally, and physicaUy,-superior to, their brethren abroad, the only exception being in favour of the easy and graceful manuners of the latter, in which they are possibly on a par with this fine old "Irish Gentleman'> himself.
