A trafii arranuement for a term of Years has been entered Into with the Eastern Counties Railway Company On advancaeous terms. and the Directors have secured the co.operation of the authorities of the Dutob-Blsenish RailwayCompny ad the other inland navigation and raiway establishmnenta in olland and Germanuy; whos Directors are so convinced of ths advantagesto be derived from this line of communication, as the mnost desirble for passenger trafie, as well as for the speedy oonveyance of specie, merchandise, and perishable goods, that they are anxious to promote the views of thin Company to the fullest possible extent.
The town of liarwich is 68 miles from London by railway, and Its post Is the meet convenient for direct communication between London and all the great seaports in Hollaund and Be!lium, and thence to the north-rn andeoentru parst of the continent ofb.uropo ; the navIgation being perfectly fre from randbanks, while two-thirds of the actual sea-passage is either in sheet water or under the lee of the land.
Passengers psocceding to India, TifiTrieste, by Harwicb, Rotterdam, and the Dutna-Rhenilsh Railway, will effect a saving of 48 hours,as compared with the route vil Marseilles, the line from Rotterdam to Trieste being on the eve of coompletion without a break, N.B. The line is already completed amfar as Adelabergr, 20 miles from Tunese, and will sbortiy be opened throughout to that free port,
The harbour of Hfarwich is safe, commodious, and easy of access In all weathers and states of the tide-advantages whIch no other port poosesses on the eastern coDast south of the Hdunber : while the en. tranice at, Helveeteolus is likewise accessible at all tides, theVoorn Canal facilitating the passage to RtotterdaLm from the latter port.
By the opening of this route, vIt, Harwich, the danger and delays of the Imntrate navigation of the Swin, and the mnouth of the Riveir Thamnes, are avoided,by which a saving of time is effected to Hamburg, Rotterdam, and Antwerp of 12 hours ; while the route to Cologne hbs Oberbausen. and from Oberhauren to the northern parts of Esarpe is 41 hours loss boy Harwich and rdttains than that by Dover an

Thus, at all ages from 19 to 6O, on the earUest policies, the accumulated bonnses now range from upwads of £f4 per cent. to upwards of £140 per cent, of the sums originally Insured; and in one instanoe to upwards of £24 per cent., or nearly two and one-half times more than the sum assurel.
To later entrants the rezte arem In proportion, equally satisfactory; the bonus now declared on aU particdpating policies of the last seven years' enduraice averaging upwards of one and one-half per cent. per annum of the sums asured, and the gradually-advancing rate of bonus, as exhibited under each succeeding declarstion, affords the fairest prospect to all present and future insrers that these resnlts wfll be maintained until they also shall derive oqually high benelits, when they become the oldest existing paUties of the Uompany.
The orusent value of any bonus may be ree-ived in cash; or It may e applied in reduction of premium. A remarkable Snstance of the wrorking of the last-named plan I afforded SD the case of a policy taken Out in 1841, the life of a person 63 years of age, in which the premium is nowv reducefd from £ 155 5s. to £13 Is, 3d.

_ LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY REPORT to the Twenty-fist Annual General Meeting of tho Proprietors, on the 12th day of February 1857
The birectors are again enabled to present to the shareholders asemts of a P3st year. vhich testify satSfactorIy to the soundness of their Institutiou, its progress and prosperity.
CapitaL-An taddition has hien made to the caPital of the Company by the Issue of 2,075 shares, makring the number in the hands of iresprietors 87,060, whleb, at £2 per share, gIvies as the paid-up capital
Fire Department.-The growing importance of the Jare business camnnot fail to prove gratifying to the proprietorS Last year the vro miums resched £186.271 16s. lid., indicating pretty clearly the estimation in Which the Compauy 13 held ; but this year they have attained the much meater sum of £222.279 IC x 6d. Any augmentation of lability, however, the proprietors will be glad to know does not arise from an indiscriminate increase in the amount taken on indiTidual buildings, but s caused by a multiplication in the number of mash Insurances which adds, materially and obviously, to the security of the result. Thelossesamountto£l0l,O16 ISa.10d.; and,iniUustrationof the last remark, but without wishing it to be understood that a mere darious casualty cannot occur, it may be mentioned that £6,000 will cover the largest loes by one fire.
Life Department.-The new busines of the past year has again surpassed that of its predeessor. Tbe number of policies Issued is 534, t- suring£418,886, on whichbthe promium is£E4277014a. lId. The toal Income from prOmfums Is t72 781 15s. 10dI and, ina ddition to that sum, £17,13 lS. I l1d. have horn sunk wlitAtheCoDmpany in the purclase of anmuities. The claims under Ulie Dolides have amounted to £23,866 4s., and the sannuities pad to £11,993 2s. fCL Of the recipients nne have died, to whom £1092s 9d. were annually pasable, The balance at the credit of the accouat is £330,459 5 .10d.
Branch Establishments and Ageucies.-In the coDmue of the year opportunIty presented St3elf ef placing the business In Sicotland under the management of a Board, wFhese great personal weight and valuable local knowvledge wrere esteemed mo3t important elements in the chances of success The advanisges anticipated from the arrasgemests thus made have, to a cousiderablo extent, developed themselvesalready, In other qluarters much benefiSt has bs*en defived from the Influenes and supevsIon ,Bhieh Boards have exercised, and the Di,rectors asusrectte~
very bighly the assistae no give in promoting the interegtiaor th Company. The increase in the number of agents, and the services they severally render, ehould not pass unacknowledged, for there is no part of the esthblish aent which has5a stronger chaim to be remombeed than the agent. ho exerts himself to wrpak eficientlB tbe town or deit trict commlttedto his charge.

F Have alwysconsidered it a trivilege to have been .L able. in any dge,to assist in a woe so eminently calculted to Promote the wonl-eiss of the poorer clas.'es in our Overgrown Metro-
Ies, and to improve their rondition, material, morai, and social,re Fleedvng extreme destitution, astfodig aid and comfort in the seasn of eICLekes, and taking away the excuse for mendicancy. one especial feature of the Society's, work is the treat assitance which it has rendered to the parochial clergy in the Important duty of visiting their
reor parishioners from house to house, and by the formation of local sudting Committees to dlraw closer the bands of Christian sympathy
ndlove. Another strikingly beneficial result of the system carried Into effect by the Association Is the increased number of Provident Societies and Penny Savings-banks, And the extraordinary amounat Of mioney dePosited by the working classes of the metropolis. I must over feel a deep interest in the succes and lprogres of the Association. - FIrom a letter of Bishop Blomtield, dated F5ulbam Palace, 17th of 3)eoember, 1410.
The separation of the rich and the poor by theIr ase te resdences la the esot and west of London is not to be denied, enw adr throuigh the splendid streets and epcos qaesoVhen westerndietricts3 we are inclined to exclaim, "- Where aro the poor? 1"We see on every ride the mansions of tbe wealthy ; we see the highly embelished and decorated shops which minister to their luxury; but we scarcel
see anY repreoentatives of the iabouring claesee of the metropolis ;and yet, I apPrehena, it is an unquestionable truth, and the necessry ro sitlt of the law by Which society in constructed, that every house which is built by a nobleman, a banker , or merchant In Belgrave or EatonL squares, or the udjacent streets, gjenerates a certain amount of
pultion, which is mabt UPOn the eastern districts removed cut of laht and out of mind. hut continually growing ana multiplying im. mor tal Lsoulo,living, dying, and passing into the grave-hundred Anid bO,hurands Of whom we know nothing, hear nothing, whom we never mee and for whom we generaaly do nothing. This in undoubtedly a serious and appaliinc state of thines. It is hardly possible to hiope that it will receive more than mitigation ; but at the sameo time grat ImitigationIt may receive. Asthe honoured nameof Bishop Blormfield bar been muentioned. I may, perhaps, be permitted to remind the meeting that to him we owe the MletropolitaCn Visiting and Relief Assootation, which was, the first reoognition, in a pernmanent form, of the duty of the west towards the east of London, for it was founded on the express anticipation that through its medium a ?Ootlon of the enormous wealth expended on the enjoyments of t owesened of the ownmigt b mae avilale or he empoarynecssiiesof the

ELECTIOZ INTELLIGRNCE.
WEST KENT.
Tuhe nomination of candidates for the representation of the western division of the county of Keent, in the room of Sir Edmund Filmer, deceased, took place yesterday, at Penenden-heath, near Maidstone.
The contest is betwc,en Mr. Wykeham Martin, the Liberal candidate, and Sir Walter B. Riddell, who avows himself to be an ardent Conservative.
At 12 o'clock there were assembled on the Reath several thousands of electors, who had come to the ground in martial order, preceded by bands of music, and with colours flying. The light blne of the Liberals much outvied, in numbers at least, the purple *nd orange of the Conservatives, but both parties arranged themselves around the hustings very harmoniously to listen to the apeeches of their respective favourites. The weather wasbeautifuly fne, and the whole proceedings of the day were conducted with tne utmost good humour, and in the most perfect order.
The writ for electing a member in the room of the late Sir E. Filmer having been read by Mr. Wyles, the Undersheriff,
Mr. 3. SAVAGE, the nigh Sheriff, said he should be happy to receive any.suggestion that might be made for sUDplying the vacancy in the representation in the western divion of the county, and he hoped that a fair and patient hearing would be given to every one who might address the me3t-
IoIHoLM AIsDAE came forward and proposed SirWalter B. Riddell, Bart., as a fit and proper person to represent the western division of the county of Kent in Parliament. (Cheers, and cries of " No.")
Sir BROOK BERIDGES aeconded the nomination.
Mr. NoRscss- proposed Mr. Wykeham Martin as a fit and proper person to represent the western division in Parliament. (Cheers.)
Mr. DAsHwooTi seconded the nomination.
Sir W. B. RIDDELL then came forward, and was received with cheers and groans. After observing that the duties which the electors were assembled together that day to discharge were of the highest importance that could devolre on Englishmen and freemen, he proceeded to notice some objections which had been brought forward by his opponents against his being elected to be their representative. The first objection was that he belonged to the profession of the law. lie certainly felt it a high corplment that during the whole of his late canvaEs not one single word hbdheensaidagainsthim, except thathe possessed some knowledge of that law which Parliament was called upon to make and to amend. (Cheers.) If an ignorance of the law was the best aualifcation of a member of Parliament, then he certainty could not ask for their Enffrages; but, tanding as he did in an hononrable and independent position in the oounty of Kent, both as a proprietor and as a magistrate, he certainly felt that he had some claim on their consideration. (Hear, bear.) He yielded to no one in the interest he felt in the county. He did not think there was *6 person present who for a moment believed that if he were to be elected he would pusue any other than an independent course, or give a single vote for his own personal advantage. (Cheers and groana.) He need hardly say that he was a Conservative, and had been so from his youth upwards. He had always acted with the party entertaining those opinions, and he had no reason to change the course he had hitherto pursued. (Cheers, and cries of " Oh ") He rejoiced to know that during the last 25 years the Conservative feeling of the country had been
reatly strengthened and confirmed. (Laughter and cheers.) XFt was their bost that while every nation on the continent had been disturbed and troubled, either by despotic Governments on the one hand, or revolutionary Governments on the other, this oountry alone had stood firm in her constitation, in her liberties, and in her loyalty to their meet exceUent Queen. (Cheers.) There was one Conservative cry in which allwere ready to join-" God save the Queen !" -yet he remembered the time when doubts were thrown on the lovalty of Englishmen, and when, in 1848, there appoired some danger of the constitution of the country being overturned. The country since then had become emphaticaUy Conservative. (Cheers and laughter.) With respect to the institutions of the country, he believed that thecharacteristic of them all which was most regarded by the people, and in which they reposed the greatest confidence, was their Protestant character. (Applause, and cries of "Oh I oh !") He believed the people would never assent to yield one inch to the aggreSsive power of the Church of Rome. He never would make any concession to that church, or agree that the State should conferuponit anyendowment. ("Oh! oh!") Hedenied that he was at all pledged to support any political party in the State. Of course, he should, if sent to Parliament, act generally with the Conservatives (" Aye, aye, that's it"); but he would not pledge himself to support any Ministry whatever. There had been a auestion of the greatest importanoe settled by the ("overnment within the last few days-he meant the income-tax. He believed that if it had not been by the determined front shown by the country at large and the movement made in the House of Commons by the Conservative party (" Oh, oh !") the income-tax would not have been taken off so soon. (Cheers and groans.) It had been said that his fnend and present opponent, Mr. Martin, was well versed in agricultural pursuits. It was true he had aade * plough, and much credit was due to him for it; bt he dourbhed whether his friend knew more about agriculture than he did, for he had beenintimately connected with those pursuits al his life. During the la-t 10 years great financal changes had taken place;, and he hoped they had promoted the general prosperity and interests of the country. Although he was oppasot h taking off the duty on the importation of foretgn corn at the time it was proposed, yet he was nowv convnnced that if the Governiment maintained the course it was at presentpursuing there was nofear but that theconstant industry and increasing skiU of the farmer would insure to him a oontinuance of that prs erity which he was now enioying. (Cheers from a sides.) There were many fnancial questions affcsting agriculture which it wasnot
possible to discuss on the hustings, but this he would say,they must take care that the Manchester School were not permitted to have it all their ownt way, but that due consiieratton should be given to the agrncultural interest. (Cheers and groans.)
Mr. WYKEILA MARTvnm then came forward, and was loudly cheered by his supporters. He entered into a long personal explanation, with a view to show that, although he hancha d his party, he had not changed his principles. (Hear, hear.) He entered Parliament as member for Newport, in the Isle of Wight, in 1837, as one of the most liberal of the supporters of the late Sir Robert Peel. At the time of passing the Reform BiU he was what was called a moderate or Conservative Reformer ; and he was essentially the same man then as he was now. After acting with the Liberal party most harmoniously for about 10 years, he thought the time was come to do what the sons of his former leader (Sir R. Pcel) had already done,-that was to say, to consider the Peel party at an end, and to unite himself as one of themselves, and not as an auxiliary with the Liberal party, with whom he had been so long acting. Thus, the ebbing and flowing of the political wave had wafted him from one side of the House to the other; so that, in fact, although he had changed sides, he had not changed his opinions. (Cheers.) His motto had always been" MIeasures and not men." He believed that those measures which were conceived in the spirit of his great leader, Sir R. Peel, were more likely to be carried out by the moderate Conservatives and Whigs than by the party having at its head Mr. Disraeli in the House of Commons and Lord Derby in the House of Lords. (Cheers.) He therefore concurred, for the purpose of carrying out those measures which he believed to be for the benefit of the country, with that party who were willing to pass them into a law. (Cheers.) Much was said by the Conservatives of the necessity of preserving the British constitution. It was his opinion that the great practical duty of public men was not merely to preserve, but to improve that constitution. (Cheers.) He wished to know where the country would now be if, starting from the time of Charles I., their forefathers had been content to maintain what they fo-nd to exist in their day. What was the British constitution ? It was a series of wise and well-considered measures, organized from age to age, by the party of progress, and brought forward by that party in spite of Conservative opposition; and which measures were afterwards adopted, as so many watchwords, by the Tories of the next age, as if such measures had existed from time inmnemorial, and they themselves had been the authors of them. (Cheers.) If he should be returned to Parliament, his endeavour would be to search out for measures of genuine improvement, to adopt them, and try to carry them when found. (Cheers.) With regard to church-rates, he bad already given his support to the bill brought in by Sir W. Clay, and ho was also favourable to an extension of the franchise as proposed by Lord J. Russell. Church-rates ought not to be required from Dissenters, and the franchise ought to be extended to lodgers. Talent, education, and knowledge ought to be quite as good qualifications for the exercise of the franchise as the mere occupation of a lOl, tenement. When in Parliament he opposed the ballot, and he was prepared to oppose it still. At the same time lie disliked coercion, intimidation, or corruption. He had always told his tenants that they were at perfect liberty to vote for any one whom they pleased, and in many instances several of them had given their votes in opposition to his own views; but he had never made any distinction in his conduct towards those gentlemen on that account. ("1 That's true Englsh !") He had advised others to folow bis example, and he was happy to know that his advice had in many instaneesbeen acted upon. He hoped this feehng _would continue to growr, and thereby sub-
stitute a more noble and energetic kind of freedom for the exercise of the franchise than the mechanical device of the ballot. (Cheers.) Although he was in sympathy allied to Lord Palmerston and his Government, yet he would not go into Parliament as a thick and thin party man. He wownd give Lord Palmerston a general support, but not a slavish support. (Cheers.)
lr. JUL, who said he was a Nonconformist, asked Sir W. RiddelU what he meant by saying in his address that the sentiments of Nonconformists were not to be fostered by the State. The Nonconfornists were one-half of the body politic; they did not ask for payment or for endowments, but they did ask for State protection.
Sir W. RrDDnx.r explained that the passage referred to by Mr. Jull applied only to Roman Catholics, and not to Protestant Dissexters.
The Rev. Mr. TALDOT asked the hon. bart. his opinion regarding the grant to Maynooth College, and whether if he were to withdraw it he was prepared to meet the agitation which it would excite in Ireland.
Sir W. RTDDn,Lr sid he was quite willing to express his opiion as to discontinuing the grant to Maynooth. He would vote in favour of such a measure, but he could not at present say what he would do supposing that measure should excite a feeling of indignation on the part of the pooplo of Ireland and endanger the union becauwe, in the, flat-place,he did not think the alternative xnupposed would everarise. He did not believe that the withholding of the gant to Maynooth would rate- any such agitation intrelandas that which his questioner as. samedNouldi be thtconsequience of that measure.

The SxzUFF then called for a show of hands, when about one-fifth of the great multitude that were usembled held up their hands in favour of Sir Walter lUddelL
On the caU being made for a show of hands on behalf of lr. Wykeham Martin a vast majority testitied their approval of thatgentleman as their representative.
The SlERw1 then declared that the election by show of bands was in favoulr of Mr. Martin. (Cheers.)

Cotton Cultivation In India.
COTTON CULTIWATION IN INDIA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TEMES.
Sir,-In an article in The T2ima of the 11th inst., on the important subject of growing foreign cottons in British possessions, there is an allusion to the fact of South Sea Island cotton having been grown near Daejeeling, in the Eastern Himalaya, and this, along with the result of other experiments, is justly regarded as a good prospect for the increasedsnpply of cotton for the English market.
The subject is so very imprtant that I do not hesitate to intrude on your valuable space with a few particulars of that experiment. It was instituted by me in 1852, with the assistance of the Government of India, and if you desire a detailed record of it, I have no doubt that I can procure the report for you
Yon are atware that the Court of Directors and the Government of Indix, in their anxiety to introduce foreign cottons into India, went to the expense of having American cotton planters to try different kinds of foreign cotton in Bundelound to the westward, and in Rungpoor and Daccarich and very productive districts of Northern BengaL In reading the result of these trials I was much struck with the stress laid by the planters on the want of rain at and soon after the oewing season as being adverse to the full success of their experiments. This vas particunlrly the case in Bundeluand; and also, but to a smaller extent, in BengaL It was, therefore, a great object to find aclimate with a wetter spring than the plains of Bengal, and this we have in the serai or lowlands at the base of the Eastern Himalaya, and in the outer vaUeys of the Daejeeling hills, where indigenous cotton is regularly cultivated, The cotton sowing season ir in February and March, and it is remarkable that about the middle of March frequent showers begin to fall, and continue to do so throughoutApril and May. This secures suffcient moisture to the young plant, and the scorching of it is obviated. It vas with a view of turning this favourable feature of the Daejeeling climate to good account that 12 cwt. of acclimatized Sea Island cotton seed was procured by me from Coimbatoor, in the Madras territory, and tried in the Daejeeling serai. It grew excelently; just as well as the indigenous cotton, and the pods were well formed and abundant. The seeds were smaller than in the local plant, and the cotton was beautifully fine, but I wasinformed by the Agricultural Society of Calcutta that the staple was shorter than that of the indigenous Sea Island cotton. Whether this was attributable to the specimens being tho produce of seed grown in India I do not know, but it would be very important to make a trisl with seed direct from the Sea Ieland district, as the Daejeelingdistrict offers great inducementsfor the cultivation of foreign cottons on account of its soil, climate, and vicinity to Calcutta, as well as on account of the facilities which are now coming into play for rapid transib by means of the East India Railway, the proposed lNorthern Bengal Railway, and the other feeders to the East India Railway, which must soon develope themselves as necessary and profitable accompaniments of this great and succemsful undertaking.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

Hospices On Barren Islands.
HOSPICES ON BARREN ISLANDS.
TO THE EDtTOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-May I be permitted to correct an error which appeared in my letter of the 9th inst. touching the latitude and longitude of the Is4a d of St. Paul?
There are two " St, Paul's." One is situated in latitude 0 55 north, longitude 29 15 west; the other in latitude 38-42 south, longitude 77-51 east. The latter, and not the former, is the island to which my remarks were intended to apply. The error in no way affects the main question-n amely, the propriety and practicability of erecting hospices on barren islands, and I should not have troubled you with this letter of my own accord. I do so at the instance of several naval officers and nautical gentlemen of experience, who have been so kInd as to put themselves in communication with me on the subject, and who at the same time have furnished me with much valuable information of which I was not previously possessed.
Knowing full well to 3 difficulties that the late Captain hlarryat ad to contend with before his code of signals was adopted, and knowing equally well how " that vsionary scheme of Lieutenant Waghorn's" (the overland route to India) was received in the first instance, I am quite prepared to encounter, not only objections, bat a moiety of ridicule. Novertheless it is my intention to proceed with the work I have undertaken, adopting for my motto the schoolboy quotation-
" No cede malis, sed contra audentior ito." I have the honour to be, Sir,

AcTi OF PARLIAMEnXI.-276 acts were passed in 1856, of which 120 were pnblic acts. The number of aets passed in former years varies from 408 in 1814-15 to 23 in 1819-20; 355 were passed in 1854-55, 388 in 1854, 391 in 1853, 278 in 1852, and 27S (the same number) in 1851.
Moan SURviVORS OF THE LYO.NNAIs.-The following is a report made by two men named Tougar, a stoker, and Cedas, a passenger, on board the unfortunate steamer Lyonnais, before the French Consul at Rio, at which port they were landed by the American ship Essex, which had picked them up at sea:-" In the morning of the 4th of November Captain Devaulx was in his gig with Dr. Clarin, the femme de chambrc, and five sailors. They were steering at some distance from the vessel. About 11 o'clock we lost siglht of them. I left the raft and went on board the Lyonnais, where I was rejoined by 20 of our companions, mostly sailors. All of them, except four, imme-
iately made an attack on the provisions and wine. It was in vain that we endeavoured to persuade them to assist in constructing a new raft; they replied that they would die on board the vesseL For us, who wished to escape death, we began to construct two, which we sent to the large one. The night eame on stormy, and was a dreadful one to pass. One of the small rafts which we had sent to the large one, and which had remained attached to the latter, parted its hawser at 11 o'clock at night, and went adrift, having on it the chief cook, named Cayolle; Romain, first stoker ; and four others. At that moment the sea was very rough, and every movement of the vessel gave such a shock to the large raft, which was fastened to her, that we thought it would go to pieces. The unfortunate men who were on it uttered the mostpieruing cries, begging that the hawser might be cut and the raft set adrift before it went to pieces. That we could not consent to, for if the raft floated away we thought we should lose all chance of safety. Alas ! when daylight appeared not a vestige beyond the part to which the hawser was attached was visible. By the side of us our drunken companions were still asleep, with their bodies half under water. We sought to rouse them up by declaring tho vessel would soon go to pieces, and that it was necessary to construct a new raft. One of them opened his eyes, and, finding that it rained, replied, ' I will not do anything while it rains.' Four nmen set to work with me, and at 6 o'clock in the morning of the 5th a last raft was completed and launched. The water had then reached to a level with the deck of the vessel, and there was not a moment to be lost. We got on the raft without provisions, and almiost without clothes, with two empty barrels, the cabin doors, and some cordae. The raft was about 30 feet square. I had with me, sides my present companion, the ship's steward, the second cook, and a stoker, whose papers are now in our possession. As to those who remained in the vessel, to the number of 15, we saw them take refuge in the forepart as the water rose over the afterpart. W. bad not got to more than four times the vessel's length froms her when she gave a lurch to starboard, and then suddenly disappeared, with a noise similar to an explosion of a mine. There was a smart breeze blowing at the time, and the sea was very rough. Our raft, formed of planks suspended on two barrels, had neither oars nor sails. Throughout the whole of the 5th the weather was squally, with rain, sleetk and snow. On the 6th there *as a very heavy sea. The raft gave a heavy lurch, and the second cook was washed away. A short time after another man in despair threw hirnself into the sea. The steward twice attempted tofollow that example, but we dragged him on board again. He, however, soon afterwards disappeared, after a very heavy sea had wasbed over us. There now remained only us two. Wehadthenbecomevery weak from long fasting, and exposure to the wet and cold. Our bandsand legs had swollen. At 8 o'clock in the morning of the 5th we saw a vessel at about a cannon's shot distance, but she did not see us, and continued on her route. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon we saw another steering for us, and she soon came close. Wo were saved. ome of the crew of the vessel jumped on our raft; and, finding that we were too weak to move, bad us slung and hoisted on board. She was the Essex, of !Bostom, botua to Rio with a cargo of ice. The captain and his wife treaa-d us with the greatest kindness, and we arrived at Rio on the 25th of December," On being aad to furnish information as to the probable fate. of' th~e othez persons embarked on beard the Lyounais the man declared that he had seen on the raft coalmeard and Voisin, tho two principal stokers ( Remeur, te coalma th a young Frcnch girl who had emkrs d at,New.

House Of Lords, Monday, Feb. 16.
PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE.
EUOUSE OF LORDS, MONDAY, FEB. ]G.
The LORD CIA-ICELLOR took his seat on the woolsack at 6 o'clock.
Lord FAVERSHAM presented a petition from Mr. James Lancelot Foster, of the city of York, proprietor and pubhsher of tbo Yorkshire Ga:etle, referring to a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench in the case of " Davidson v. Duncan," in which it was laid down that the publication in a newspaper of a report of the proceedings at a rublic meeting would form the ground of an action for libel against the
thfliher of suchi newspaper, although the report was true, aithful and correct, and published without malice. The petitioner humbly prayed tnat the Hlouse would be pleased to take into consideration the present stato of the law with reference to this subject, and consent to an alteration of the law, providing that the publication of a fair and accurate report shall not subject the publisber to an action for libel; also from Mr. L. W. Theakston, proprietor of the Scarborough Gazctfe, to the same eflect.
Lord LYTTELTON presented a petition from Binningham, complaining of the Persian war and of the bombardment of Canton, and praying that Parliament might exercise a stricter control over the foreign policy of the Government.
Lord BROUGHAM presented a petition from the proprietor of the Lecds Aesrcury, expressing alarnm at the decision pronounced in the case of " Davison v. Duncan," and praying that the protection afforded to the publishers of fair reports of proceedings in courts of justice might be extended to the publication of proceedings at public meetings. The noble lord observed that it was a very grave question, upon which he abstained for the present from pronouncing any opinion beyond expressing his sense of the importance of the subject, of the respectability of the petitioner, and the necessity for a speedy and mature consideration of the subject.
THE OPIUM TRADE WITH CHINA.
The Earl of SHAFTESBURY gave notice of his intention on Monday, March 2, to bring under their lordships' consideration the traffic in opium between tlse East Indies and China.
Jt-DICIAL STATISTICS.
Lord BROIUGIIAMi sid, he was about to present a bill similar to one which hc bad laid before their lordships last year, combined with a large number of schedules-a bill for faci itating the collection of judicial statistics. He had upon a forser occasion entered fully into a consideration of the incalculable benefits that would be derived from a good system of judicial statistics, and had shown that, not only was this country in that respect behind France and Gernmany, but was even behind Naples. Until some system was adopted we should be legislating in the dark in all matters relatinig to legal enactnments and legal procedure, and until such a system was adopted legislation in matters of law could not be called an inductive science, for they were labouring in the dark, without any knowledge of the effects of existing laws or the consequences of any changes in those laws. The bill he now psesented was exceedingly short, and he hoped before the second reading the schedules which bad undergone revision, correction, and improvement hy the Law Amendnent Society, wnould be perfected, and thatuhe should he enabled to lay before the House a complete set of schedules. The noble and learned lord concluded by
laying the bill upon the table. |
The LORtD CHANCELLORt observed that the subjectI had been under the consideration of the Governm ent during the recess. No doubt, returns showving the amount of business done, the salaries paid, and other facts relating to the various courts, would be of great use.
RETIRING ALLOWANCES FOR BISHOPS.
Viscount DUNGANNON gave notice that on Thursday next lhe would ask the Lord Privy Seal whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to introduce any bill during the present session for dividing the see of London-; and also whether Her htajesty's Government Intended to bring forward any measure for providing for bishops who from advanced age or other infirmities might be desirous of being relieved from their episcopal duties?
THE PERSIAN WAR.
The Earl of CLARENDON.-As my noble friend behind me (Lord Albemarle) has a notice on the paper in reference to Persia, I venture to appeal to him to have the goodness to put it off for a short time, as at the present moment negotiations are pending in Paris upon that subject; and only this very morning I received a communication which leads me to hope that those negotiations will be brought to a successful issue. I hope therefore my noble friend will not consider me asking too much in begging of him to defer his uotion.
The Earl of ALBEMARLE said, after the appeal which had been made to him by his noble friend he should have no hesitation in withdrawing for the present the motion which it had been his intention to bring forward. It would certainly have been his wish, in moving for the returns in question, to have avoided as much as possible any observations on the present hostilities with Persia. His noble friend had said that in a few days the time would, perhaps, lhave arrived when such a motion might be brought forward without the probability of harm, and that being so he (the Earl of Albemarle) hoped then to have an opportunity of recurring to the subject. Ee would only now say that, in his opinion the only way of preserving friendship with Persia would be to do away with anl diplomatic relations with that country.
PRIVATE BILLS.
Lord BROUGHAM, adverting to the rule of the House which assigns the 23d of March as the last day on which private bills can be brought forward in ihe present session, appealed to the noble lord the chairman of committees (Lord Redesdale) to relax the strict rule in that respeut with reference to one or two cases of some urgency which, he said, it was highly expedient should be brought under their lordships' consideration this session, especialy that of Mr. Shedden. That was a question of title to an estate, tried in Scotland nearly 50 years ago, and subsequently reviewed by the House of Lords during the Chancellorship of Lord Eldon, on both which occasions he (Lord Brougham) acted as counsel for Mr. William Shedden, the claimant. Without gaing now into the merits of the case, he would only say that there were circumstances connected with it of such a peculiar character as, in his opinion, imperatively to require that it should be reopened in some shape before their lordshire' house with the view of justice being done to the unhappy gentleman, Mr. W. Shedden, whom he represented, an who had suffered a grievous wrong for nearly 60 years. Mr. Shedden would probably bring his case under the consideration of the House in the form of a private bill, but as, unless a relaxation were made in the rule of the House, he should not be able to do so until his (Lard Brougham's) return from a necessary absence of some weeks in the country, he should be obliged if lis noble and learnedfriend (Lord Redesdale) would make the case an excepion and suspend the forms of the lHouse in its favour, as it was one in which he (Lord Brougham) took an especial interest. (EIear, hear.)
Lord REDESDALE said the 23d of March was the day fixed as that beyond which no private bill could be introduced to the House, and, although he wished to adhere to that rule as far as possible, yet, as the case to which his noble and learned friend had referred was one of a peculiar character, he should offer no objection to it on the score of time, after the appeal made by his noble and learned friend.
Lord BROtTGHAhl said nothing sould be more considerate than the prompt mauner in which his noble and learned friend had yielded to his request, and he was convinced that when their lordslips came to hear the case of Mr. Shedden, whatever appearance of difficulty there might be about it, they would devise a remedy, however long that might have been delayed, for the iNjustice which he believed to have been perpetrated. (Loud cries of " Hear, hear.")
The LORD CHANCELLOR said, without meaning to interpowe any obstacle in the way of the forms of the House being relaxed for the accommodation of this particular case, he would only remark that the parties whom it was now sought to oust from the estate in this case had been in possession of it for, he believed, 60 years, and if their lordships at this distance of time reopened a question of this kind, the title of not one of the members of their lordships' House to his estate would afterwards be free from some similar attempt to question its legality.
Lord REDESDALE said the remark of his noble and learned friend on the woolsack would be quite true in reference to an ordinary case, but there were peculiar circumstances about this which appeared to make it an exception.
Earl GREY said, he was about to present a petition to the House on behalf of Mr. William Shedden, and should have done so this week bad it not been for the intended absence of his noble and learned friend (Lord Brougham), who had explained to their lordships the great personal interest he took in the case. He (Earl Grey) would ask their lordships in the meantime to suspend their judgment until the facts were before them, which he thought were such as to prove to them that injustice had been done, and that it demanded a remedy.
TE SHEEPSHANKS COLLECTION OF PICTURES.
Lord MONTEAGLE, in moving for certain correspond onece between the Government and Mr. Sheepshanks in reference to his git of pictures to the nation, reminded their lordships that he made a similar motion in 1848 in relation to the munificent gift of pictures which the late Mr. Vernon made to the country. Since that time we had received several other donations of that kind, and those had been very re-
cently supplemented by the offer of the collection which was now the subject of his present motion. He did not think those gifts had been received eitber by the public
or by Parlialoent quite in the spirit which might have
been expected. The public were not generally in possession
of the facts in relation to our nationa collection of pictures, for both in that and the other House of Parliament he had
heard the collection discussed as if it were altogether the act of the State and purcbased out of the national resources; whereas, in point of fact, we were indebted for it
much more to the generosity and public spirit of private individuals than to any liberality which Parliament had shown iu the matter. (Hear, hear.) From 1824 to 1833 the number of pictures purchased by the nation for the

3ince Mr. Vernon's gift the nation had received a most splendid bequest from the late Mr. Turner Of the pictures left by that artist 100 were entirely finished and 182 net
less important or instructive, were unfinshed while, per-
haps, the most valuable of all were 1S,749 drawings and sketches. From this mere recital of the numbers of these works of art their value might be estimated. Within a very short time the nation had received another gift. Mr. Sheepshanks, wbo was known to many of their lordships as a collector and a man of taste, had given 233 pictures and 103 drawings and sketches; so that from these individuals alone the nation had received 19,823 works of art, far exceeding in numnbc those which had been purchased by the Government with the large means at their disposal. He remembered that in the case of the Dclwich colleoction Mr. Vansittart on the part of the Government of the day refused to accept that gift from Sir Francis Bourgeois, on the ground that the Government were not prepared to vote the money for the construction of a suitable room. Theso days were, he trusted, gone by, and he hoped he should hear from his noble friend that Mr. Sheepshanks's Splendid gift had been accepted, subject to the conditions attached to it by the donor. He begged to move for a copy of any correspondence between Her Majesty's Government and Mr. Sheepshanks respecting the gift of his collection of pictures to the nation.
Lord STANLEY of ALDERLY said he held in his hand Mr. Sheoepshanks's deed of gift and the acknowledgment on the part of the Government of that noble gift. The donor, of whom it was impossible to speak in too high terms, was well known to most of their lordships as having been engaged, during a life of no short duration, in collecting some of the choicest specimens of British art; and now, wishing himself to see them placed in a situation where they might prove more extensively useful, and not waiting until death had removed him from the scene, he had offared them to the nation. Mr. Sheepshanks had naturally attached some conditions to his donation. In the first place, it was his opinion that, for the purpose of establishing a national gaUery of British art, it was desirable that his collection should be placed in a situation where it would be generally accessible to the public without being interfered with by the noise or injured by the dirt of the metropolis and that it should aLso be in immediate connexion with thosa schools of art to which he thought it was calculated to prove of great advantage. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Sheepshanks also desired that the superintendence and management of this coUection should be vested in a Minister of the Crown who should be solely responsible, and not placed in the hands of any body of managers or trustees, who he thought might not be so directly amenable to public opinion for its proper administration as a Minister of the Crown. The person selected as the first trnstee, and who for the time being was to have the custody and management of the collection, was the head of the department of art education in this country. Up to the present moment this task had devolved upon him, but it would shortly fall into much more worthy hands by being transferred to the Committee of the Privy Council on Education, in the department of his noble friend near him (Earl Granville). Another condition annexed to the gift was that a suitable building, welllighted, airy, and commodious, should be erected to receive it, situated in the ground at Kensingtorn purchased by the commission of 1851, upon which had been erected the schools of art formerly located at Marl. borough-house. Mr. Sheepshanks wished that, in the first instance, his pictures should be more especialy used for the promotion of art in these schools. Next he wished, if the responsible Minister thought fit, that portions of the collection should be sent into the provinces for exhibition there as examples of art. Then the collection was to be thrown open to the public at convenient times, subject to the conditions stated. Mr. Sheepshanks aso expressed an earnest desire (though this was not made a condition of the gift) that the gallery should be open on Sunday evenings, for the inspection of the working classes, who during the week had not the opportunity of visiting such places. These, then, wero simply the conditions attached by Mr. Sheepshanks to his mrunificent present. If the Government should think proper to ' accept it on such conditions, he mnade it over to the nation with no reservations, nay, even with the express desire on his part that it might not form an exclusive gallery, separate from other pictures of which the State might become possessed, but that it sheuld form tho nucleus of a great coilection of British art, and he did not wish that his name should be at all connected with it. (Hear, hear.) In making this donation, Mr. Sheepshanks desired to offer his testimony to the advantage which had resulted from that department of art which originated in the Exhibition of 1851. In his opinion, this department had conferred great benefits upon this country, and would, if properly encouraged and promoted, be productive of still greater advantages. Even in a purely material point of view, looking only to the commercial advantages derived by this country, Mr. Sheepshanks already saw great advantage from the existence of such a department, in which opirnion ae (Lord Stanley of Alderley) entirely concurred. With regard to material fabrics and cheapness of production, England had for a long tirme borne off the palmn, but it could not be concealed that in correctness of taste and design we had faUen short of many other countries. He believed this might in a great measure be traeed to the absence of opportunities enjoyed by the people and the working classes for instruction in the true principles of art. He was happy to say that there was a growing disposition on the part of the public to avail themselves of the schools of art lately established throughout the country, that they derived great advantage thereby, and that there was hardly an artesan or mnechanic who did not at once recognie the benefite resulting from the Instruction Imparted. He thought it right ineidentally to alude to these points, as they formed part of the motives which had induced Mr. Sheepshanks to make this gift to the nation. Before concluding he felt bound to express the admiration of the Government at the ppatriotism and munificence of gifts of such a character, and he trusted that such a course might find many imitators, when it was seen that pictures so presented to the nation were placed in buildings proper and suitable for their exhibition, thereby declaring the value and appreciation which the Government and Country attached to such gifts. The noble lord concluded by laying the correspondence upon the table.
TEE YEOMANRY CAVALRY.
The Earl of POWlS, in rising to move for certain returns connected with the yeomanry, complained of their not being regularly called out for training, and wished to call the attention of the noble lord the Secretary for War to the improbability of their discipline and efficiency being maintained if they were only called out once in two years. The time of training was nominally eight days ; bat then there were the days of marching in and marching out, the review day, and one Sunday, so that therewere actuallyonlyfour workingday&. Now there was no person who had the slightest knowledge of military arrangements but would admit at once that four days in two years were not a sufficient period of practice, however able the officers or intelligent the men, to preserve the discip ine and efficiency of a regiment of yeomanry. Suppose, or instance, that during the current year the yeomanry were called out to aid the civil power, they would, from want of training, not be in the highest state of efficiency, for the horses of the corps would be raw and untrained and unaccustomed to act together. Persons in the yeomanry were obliged, under penalty, to keep horses to enable them to perform their duties, and those horses wore not liable to duty if the corps was called out; and he should like to know if any exemption would be made of that duty if a corps should not be called out for training ? The noble lord concluded by moving that an addre3s be presented to Her Majesty for a return showing the years since 1815 in which the yeomanry had not been assembled either for permauent duty or trauing and exercise, and also for a copy of any circalar from the Secretary of State to the Lord-Lieutenants of counties as to the assembling of the yeomanry during the present year.
Lord PANMURE said that there would be no objection to the first return moved for by the noble earl, but it would not be possible to produce the circular referred to in the latter part of the motion, as, in point of fact, no circular had been despatched. When he had a seat in the other House of Parliament he had always resisted the annual attacks made upon that corps, and he had not changed the opinion which he had then so frequently expressed, that they were a most valuable corps. At the same time he thought that the Government might, without infringing upon what was due to that corps, when they were informed by the reports which they received that the venmanry were in a highly efficient state, dispense with cailing them out for one year. As regarded the probability expressed by the noble earl, of the yeomanry being called out i aid of the civil power and proving inefficient, he could only say that he saw not the slightest prospect, judgong from the present aspect of things in the first place, and from the Pohce Act of last session in the next, of their services or those of any military force being called for in aid of the civil power. With reg^sard to the subject of a contingent allowance, in the case of their not being called out, for the horse duty, it was a subject to which he would give the most careful consideration.
The Earl of EGLINTOUN regretted the course which the Governient intendedto adopt with regardtotheyeomainry, priving them of the advantagAe of drill and training. HEe also entirely disagreed with the noble lord in thinking that

The Marquis of AYLESBURY spoke to the general efficiency of the yeomanry corps, and asked how the men were to be othed and paid if no money were to be voted for
Lord WARD also bore testimony to the excellent training and usefulness of the corps; but he urged that if they were not to be maintained in an efficient state the sooner they were given up the better. He looked upon them as a most gallant, true, and able force, and he contended that their claims to consideration should not lightly be passed over,
i Lord LYTTELTON had heard with a great deal of surprise the expression of the Minister for War, that the yeomanry were never likely again to be called out in support of the eivilpower. If they were not tobe employed for that purpose he was at a loss to understand of what use they were.
Le should like to be informed whether the yeomanry were to be called out this year; and if they were not, whether the Government had made any definite rule upon the subject 2-whether there were to be any periodical callings out Of the yeomanry, or whether the matter was each year to be left in doubt?;
Lord PANMURZ explained, that all he had said was

to express a hopo that the services of the yeomaury vould not agOain be required to support the civil poWer, especially as a police force now existed in every county w-hich wVas sufficient for the protection of life and property. The Government had laid down no regular rule with respect to calling out the yeomanry, but he trusted that next year there wonld be no greater necessity for calling them out than existed now.
The Earl of CARNYARVON thought, that if the yeomanry underwent a less amount of training than they received at present it would be ntterly useless, and added, that he could not understand what it was that iaduced the Secretary for War to make an exception with respect to caUing out the yeomanry this year, unless he intended to abolish voluntary corps altogether. 'He held that to deprive a yeomanry regiment of its driU for one year would, for aU practical purposes, disorganize it for two or three years.
Eairl GRANYVILLE was anxious that no misapprehension should exist with respect to the decision of the Government to suspend the caUing out of the yeomanry during the present year. They had not adopted that resolution as a permanent measure; but now that we were at peace, and that the country was in a state of Prosperity and tranvuilty, there was every reason to hope that the purely civil force would be amp~ly sufficient to meet al the deman,ds upon it. Moreover, the people would be called upon during the present year to make considerable sacrifices on account of the late war, and that wvas another reason wvhy no nunnecessary expense should be incurred by the assembling of the yeomanry.
After a few remarks from Lord DE TABLEY, the motion was agreed to.
THE LAW OF LL.BEL.
Lord CAIIPBBLL, who was very imperfectly heard, Wa understood to present a petition praying their lordships to take into consideration the present state of the law with reference to the pablication in newspapers of reports of the proceedings at public meetings, and consent to an alterstion in that law, providing that the publication of a fair and accurate report, without malice, of such proceedings should not subject the publisher to an action for libel. The noble and learned lord said,-My lords, this is a very mport3nt subject, and very well 4eserves the consideration of yonr lordships sitting as a branch of the Legislature. There came before the Court of Queen's Bench lasb7 term, in the case of " Davison v. Duncan," the question whether all the proceedings of all public meetings when bond fide published may be published without any danger of any legal proceedings, however much they may calumniate an individual and be injurions to private character. I and my brethren in that court arrived without the slightest hesitation at the conclusion that, as the law of England now stands, there is no such immunity. We were not at liberty to consider whether the privilege sought for ought to be given to the press. It would have been a mo~t monstrous usurpation if we had decided that the publication before us was not liable to an action; for it had been determined over and over again by our predecessors, by whose decisions we are bound, that if there be anything slanderous in a writing it is subject to an action, and that it is no justification to plead that the slanderous matter has been written or spoken by another person. Such is the law of England at present, and to call upon us to alter the law, if we think it wrong, would be as preposterous as to say that we are at liberty to set aside the law of primogeniture and divide the landed estate of a deceased person equally among all his children. Our duty
to administer the law, not to abolish or even amend it. When I had the honour to propose in this house a bill which afterwards became law, and which effected a most material improvement in the law of libel, I submitted a clause very limited in its nature-for I was afraid to go very far-providing that any bo fide account of the proceedings of either House of Parliament should be privileged, and not subject to an action. I was unable to carry it; there was a majority against me, because it was said not only that the law gave no sach privilege, but that it ought not to give it. After having failed as a member of this House to alter the law, it would have been a breach of my duty if, sitting s a judge in a court of justice, I had declared the law to be contrary to what your lordships had decided it to be. Your lordships may reconsider that decision, and, in that case, if my proposal with respect to the proceedings of the two Houases should be again submitted I shall be glad to give it my most ardent support. For it seems to me monstrous to say that if there be a bond fide report of a speech in Parliament published the publisher should be liable to an action. That is difforent from a case which occurred about 50 years ago, when a noble earl in this house made a speech calumniating his steward, and published it himself. The publication in question led to an action, because it was not a bond fie account of the proceedings in this house, but was intended to calumniate a private indi vidual; and such an action would continue to be available if the clause which I proposed were passed into a law tomorrow. But while, as far as the proceedings of the two Houses of Parliament are concerned, I would zealously sup. port the extension of the privileges of the press, I am not sure that I would grant the same immunity to reports of the proceedings of all public meetings, because to say that the publication in newspapers of whatever is said at any public maecting, or at anything which may be called a public meeting, shonld be privileged would be going rather too far. It has been said that the person calumniated may bring an action against the man who makes the speech; but it must be remembered that a speech spoken is a smaller offence than one that is published and sent all over the world. Still I am not prepared to say that the liberty of publication should not be extended to all public meetings under certain limitations and restrictions, but I hold that it would be preposterous for the judges sitting on the bench to legislate as weU as to declare what the law of England is, and I hope that such a precedent wiU never be established in this country. (Hear, hear.)
Their lordships adjourned at half-past 6 o'clock.

CEYON.
Mr. BYNG wished to ask the Secretaxy of state for the CoOnI'es when it was his intention to lay before the House the last annual report of the Governor of Ceylon on the state of that colony ; and whether he would at the same time furnish a copy of the letter of Viscount Torrington to the Secretary 0 tat for the Colonies on the same sub. lect, under date January 17, 1857.
Mr. LABOUCHERE said the report of the Governor of Ceylon was published in a, blue-book containing the reports of the Governors of the other colonies, which would apca at the usual time in the course of next maonth, Lord Teoar-
givn t hi, ad ordTJringontoo exeptonto some thins wich e tougt releced ;penhisadministra-
tion. That impression was founded, as he thought, upon a misconception of ;he language of Sir H. Ward, but Lord Tonington desired that his letter should be commnnicated to the House. The usual course, which would be followed in the present case, was that when the dispatch was Laid upon the table, if the hon, member wished to move for the production of Lord Torrington's letter, he should not object toits publication.
VA.CCINATION.
Mr. T. DlNCOMBE rose to ask the Vice-President of the Board of Health when the committee on vaccination, agreed to by the Government during the last session, was to be appointed.
Mr. COWPER said it was proposed that a biU of somewhat similar character to that of Lest year should be brought in and zeferred to a select committee, with the understanding that they shouldfulyinquireintothe working and the results of the present law, and the best means of amending it. He beaeved that the bill would be brought in in thecourse of a fewdays.
ECCLESIASTICAL COMISSION.
Lord R. CECIL wished to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether it was his intention to bring in any bl for the purpose of giving effect to reconimendations of the committee which sat last session on the Ecclesiastial Commission.
Sir G. GREY.-A biU has been prepared, and I hope to give notice of its introduction on an early day.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.
Mr. IPMAHON asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he had any reason to expect that the commission for inquiring into the administration of justice would make a report in time to found a measure thereon this session.
Sir G. GREY said that the commission were now sitting and were taking evidence upon some of the matters referred to them. As he was not a member of the commission it would be impossible for him to say when they would make their report.
THE EXHIBITION OF PLANS IN WESTMINSTER..
HAL1L
Lord R. CECIL should be glad to know from the Chief Commissioner of Works whether the judges of the approaching competition, with reference to the new Government offices, would be appointed before the day on which the plans were seat in. Also, whether he intended, in appointing thejudges, to confine his selection to those who were uentangled by any personal connexion with the profession, or whether he intended to incude mong them practising architects.
Sir B. HALL said it was not his intention to nominate any of the judges until after the plans were sent in. With regard to the judges, it was his intention to nominate some gentlemen who were not connected with engineering or architecture, and to associate them with others having a thorough knowledge of those professions. It would not be difficult, he thought, to select competent persons who were not at all connected w ith the competitors, and it was not hia intention to appoint any judges wvho ere connected with the candidates.
EXPULSION OF JAMES SADLEIR.
Mr. J. FITZGERALD said that the duty had devolved upon him of bringing before the House a resolution for the expulsion of one of the members for Tipperary. 'Ho did not apprehend It would be necessary for him to occupy the attention of the House at any considerable length, since a unanimous feeling had been expressed on both sides of the house that sooner or later tho order for the expulsion of Mr. Sadleirmustbemade(hear), and it only rested withhim to satisfy the House that at the present period, without danger and without forming an unconstitutional precedent, he might ask the House to agree to an order for his expulsion. That the Housepossessedthe rigbt to expel a member did not admit either of doubt or controversy. The right had been repeatedly exercieed from an early period either when members had been guilty of a posi. tive infraction of the laws against crime, or had committed various offences against the laws of the House, or had been guilty of acts thatwere discreditable, or had been guilty of frauds and fraudulent practices, which showed that the particular members were unfit to exercise the trust that the constitution had imposed upon them, and that they ought not to continue to associate with the members of the House. There could be no doubt that this power existed, and the records of Parliament would show that it had been repeatedly exercised. The House did not in such cases proceed upon mere technical legal p roof. (Hear.) It sometimes acted upon the conviction of the parties, but it had also acted against a conviction and against an accuittaL Sometimes it proceeded by its own peculiarmethodas to inquire into the state of facts. Sometimes it heard the member in his place, and in other cases where charges of fraud, or discreditable conduct, had been made openly against a member, when he had failed to attend in his place, and when the House had been induced to believe that he had fled from justice, it proceeded without hearing hin to make the order for his expulsion. He would shorty advert to the precedents which bore upon the case now under consideration, which would show that it came within the class of cases already provided for, and would not form a new precedent of its own. He would now call the attention of .he House to two or three instances in which this course had been adopted. It appeared from the report of the Committee of Precedents tnat the earliest penod at which the power of expulsion bad been exercised by the House was m 1580, when Mr. Hal, the member for Grantham, was expeUed for having published a book reflecting upon certain members. In 1606, aSir C. Pigott, the then member for Bnckinehamshire, was expelled for using words of scandal and obloquy. (A laugh.)
DI beseeming such an audience. Not pertinent to the matter in hand, and very unseasonable for the time and occasion."
The House might think that a dangerous precedent, but they would not be surprised at it when he told them that it occurred in the reign of James L, and that the slanderous words were spoken of Scotland and Scotchmen. In 1620 Mr. Shephard was expeUed for using profane language in debate. In 1628 Sir Edmund Sawyer was expelled for a discreditable attempt to tamper with a witness who was about to be examined before a committee, by telling him that he would not be examined upon oath, and he need not speak of anything that had passed between them. He would pass over the period of the Long Parliament and the contest between the Parlament nd the Crown. and come to the somewhat less unconstitutional reign of Charles IT., during which there were many instances of expulsion. In 1667 Mr. Ashburnham was expeUed for having committed the dishonourable offence of receiving 500. for promotu the business of the French merchants. An instance occurred in 1668 which in one of its elements made a near approach to the present case. An inquiry took place beforu the House in reference to the naval battle which had been fought off Lowestoft in 1665, in which the Datch were defeated by the Duke of York, the result of which was that the member for New Romney was ordered to attend in his place on the following Tuesday t-o answer matters objected against him in relation to the miscarriage in not pursuing the Dntch fleet. He did not appear, and for his contempt of the order and waiving the justice of the House he was expelled. Passing over several intermediate instanoes, he now came to the reign of William m. In 1m5 Mr. Pryse was expelled his offence being that he hbd refused to attend the service of the House, and had X- sconded. In 1720 Mr. Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was expelled for having been concerned in the South Sea frauds. In 1722 Lord Barrington was expeUed for having been concerned in a fraudulent undertaking called the arbnrgh Lottery. The next precedent he should mention appeared to him to bear very much on the p resent case. In 1732GeorgeRobinson, themember for GreatMarlow, was expeUed. It appeared that a petition was presented from Blenheim complaining of a fraud committed on a charitable corporation for the relief of the industrious poor. The petition was referred to a committee, which reported in the course of its proceedings that George Robinson ,ad been charged with fraudulent practices. Notice having been taken of the report in the house, George Pobinson was ordered to attend on the following Tuesday. Ile did not attend, and the messenger having proved the service of the order at the town and country residences of the member, and stated his belief that he had gone beyond the seas, an inquiry took place, after which, on the 3d of April, 1732, the House came to the foUowine resolution
" That George Robinson, MYL. for Great Marlow, having been charged in Parliament with having been concerned in manyidirect andfraudulent practices, and never having attended the service of the House, although required to do so, is guilty of a high contempt. That, for his said contempt, heboe ex pelled."
He called the attention of the House to the fact that in this case there was no proof of guilt, although there was every reason to believe that the person charged had fled the country. (Hear, hear. ) Iu 1810 Mr. Hunt was expeUed in his absence, there being evidence that he was in France, in a letter written to the Speaker. In 1812 Mr. Benjamin Walsh was convicted of felony, but sabsequently pardoned as the facts did not bear out the charge. Notwithstanding that his conviction was quashed the House came to the conclusion that the charge of felony involved a charge of fraud, and he was accordingly expeed. He had mentioned
teses precedents merely to showi the ,powe0r,posssessed by the House, and he would now proceed to cal attention to the circumstances of this case, especially to those which distinguished it from the position in which it stood when it was brought under the notice of the House on the 24th of June last. About 12 months ago they were all startled by the intelligence of the melancholy suicide of the member for Sligo, and in consequence of that catastrophe inquiries were instituted which led to the discovery of the extensive frauds and crimes in which that unfortunate man had involved himself,the pressure of which, doubtless, drove him to the further crime of self-slaughter. Among the institutions injured by his acts the greatest sufferer was the Tipperas.; Bank, which was entirely rained. A suit was soon instituted, and, proceedings connected with the suit having come before the Master of the RoUs in Ireland, that learned judge, on the 4th of June, plainly indicated, not in
a judgment, but in some observations from the bench, that he was of opinion that there was sufflcient cause to found a criminal charse against James Sadleir. The charge made against dalmes SadleirZ therefore, was not private, but
open and notoinous, Froce ading from the ench of justice and must have been aown to him. On the same occasi
the Master of the Rolls gave the persons known in the litigation s the English shareholders an opportu
nity of making further affidavits, for the parpose of bringing forward additional evidence of the rrnofJ ames Sadleir, and he believed on the 7th of June the affidavit of a person named Giniger wras filed in the Court of Chancery. On MSonday, the 9th of Jutne, James Sadleir made an affidavit, in answer to that of Ginger, describing himself as of Clonacody, in the county of Tipperary, M.r., which was not sworn at the proper office m Dablin, bat at Eingstown; and there was every reason to believe that when it was sworn James Sadleir was on his way out of the country, to which he had never since returned, On the 20th of Juno the judgment of the Master of the Rolls was delivered, in which that learned
judge, after a careful examination of the documents a-id evidence, canae to tbe conclusion that those documents and th at evidence established the caee of fraud he had before shadowed out; he also went through several cases of fraud which had been established, and among them he mentioned the abstraction of the sum of 250,000. from the Tipperary Joint-Stock Bank for his (James Sadleir's) brother's purposes, the result of which had been the ruin of that institation. proceedings were tfken immediately afterwards against J.ame Stdeir, which resulted Tin a warrant being issued for his apprehension, founded upon a declaration or information upon oath. That warrant, together with the information, had been before the House sirce July Last. On thie 6th of July a duplicate of that warrant was trans. mitted to England to be placd in the hands of the police authorities. Subsequent to the 4th of July no less than seven different warrants were issued for his apprehension. On the 18th of July bills of indictment were p referred against him at the summer asszes at T,ipperary, tha being the county he represented in Parliament ; and these hills, chargmng hin with several conspiracies to defraud, were found by the grand jmj Though such finding was not proof of guilt, yet the monse could not forget that the duty of grandiury was toproceed o the groun thatthe Me if unaMswered, would warrantoonviction. Looking, then, to hhe notoriety of the proceedings,te the fact of witnessea being examinedJand of hon. bein g fot rwandjumin thec
which Mr. James Sadleir represented, it did appear that the circumstance were such as left no doubt that the fact's must have come to his ear. (Hear, hear.) At this stage of the proceedings the member for Sheffield, on the 2lst of July, obtained an order of the House that Mr. James Sadleir should attend in his place on the third day therefrom. That order was regularly served at the residences of Mr. Sadeir, and also upon the solicitors acting for him in the litigation of the Tipperary Bank; and on the 24th of July the hon. member brought forwardl his maotion for the expulsion of Mr. James Sadleir, urging the circumstances he had just adverted to as the foundation of his motion. The motion was smtained by the hon. and learned member for Dublin UniTersity, whot brought several precedents under the attention of the House, and both these members expressed their strong oinioni that upon the notoriety of the case 'there was gafficient ground before the House to justify it in proceeding to order the expulsion of Mr. James Sadleirg On that occasioi
other members of this House took a more cautious view, though he believed there was no difference of opinion that Mr. Jatmes Sadleir must sooner or later be expeled. It was thought by many hon. members that to proceed to expel Mr. J. Sadeir, after the lapse of only six days froI
theJaime of the birs of indictment being foatnd, and of three dayi from the passing of the order fori his attendanoce was to run the danger of setting a precedent which was unconstitutional, and which might in other times be used for a bad purpose. Accordingly the previous question was moved. He would now proceeod to state what had occurred in the ean tune. The proceedings of outlawry against Mr. James Sadleir could not be terminated before November last. He had caready stated that several warrants were out for Mx. jamles sameies apprehension, and the exertions of the authorities to execute them were unremitting; but in bringing forward this motion he considered it his duty to plaeo before the House documentary evidence of this fact. (The hon. and learnel gentleman here referred to reports from the Deputy Inspector-General of Constabulary, from the County Insetor of the Tiemrary Constabulars, and other officers, to show that the'polce both in Ireland and England had been for seven months past making the greatest exer. tions to seeue the apprehension of Mr. James adleir, or to ascertain if he had fled the country.) The Deputy InTpector-GQneral stated :-
rI am enabled to state that in their endeavours to execute these warrants the most strenuous and reiterated, and at the same time discreet, though unsu ccful, exertions were put forth by the police; the suspected localities, not onlytinthe countY of Tiphe , but elsewhere, being watched, patrolled, orsarh bl night as well as day, while a speclu watch was kept (by a man acquainteU with Mr. Sadfleir's appearance, sent u from Clonmnel for that

The indictment against ir. James Sadleir was removpo the Court of Queen's Bench, and that person had had an opportunity in November, if he were in the eountry and so minded, to surender and meet the charge, and another opportunity in January last, during Hilary Term, oreat the gittings after. in addition he must call the attention of the House to certain docunents delivered that morning, containing the orders made bY the courts at Duxblin, in October, December, and jannary last, to substitute service. The mieaning of that was that when a court of law was satisfied that the person who was to be served with proes had left the country, but having some agent or person in it on whom a service of process for him would be good, it made an order substituting service. Accordingly, he found that the three superiorvourts of law in Dublin had in proceedings aainst here Jeamtes Sletter inEwhic r. It adleir was per-

To that reply he had received no anwer. The hon, and learned gentleman here ratheletterreferred to. It is as follows
"f Hotel dux Louvre, Rue do Rivoli, Paris,
Feb. 12, 1857.
IcSire-I considoer it m duty to inform you that th notorious culprit James Saille is now in Paris, having sen him last night enter a restaurnt inr the Palais Royal, where I dined, and having caught mY eye, he immnediately withdrew.

'Tache. a'onidzerable,change hAsP.takednpaei."
IHe was not acqued with the writer of that letter, but he inferred that he was a gentleman of respectability, who recently resided in Tipperary, and who, he believed, had been ruined and driven from the country by the disraption of the Tipperary Bank. The House might ask why the Government did not proceed at onceuupon that information to arrest MIr. Sadleir in Paris; but his case did not come within the extradition treaty between Great Britain and France, dated the 13th of February, 1843, for the crimes included therein were restricted to murder, an attempt to commit murder, forgery, and fraudulent bsnkruptcy. He (Mr. Fitzgerald) had now s'ated all the additional circinmstances whichbhadoccurred sice lastJuly. There could be no controversy that gigantic frauds had been committed by
lr. Sadleir, both with reference to the Tipperary Pank and other matters, Mfr. Sadleir had been openly chazged with those frauds. Mfr. Sadleir was in the country whean the Master of the Rolls in Ireland charged him from the bench in a suit in which he was a party with being implicated in them. He knew, or ought to know, that a motion for his expulsion was made by the hon. and learned member for Sheffield. jfe was aware that warrants had been issued for his apprehension, and, knowing all these things, he had fled from the country. All efforts to arrest him were vain. He (Mr. Fitzgerald) had examined the division lists of that House in order to ascertain whether upon any occasion since the motion of the hon. and learned member for Sheffield was made Mr. Sadleir had taken part in the Froceedings of the House, but his name was not to be round in those lists. Due notice had been given to him of the present motion. If he had any intention of taking any step in consequence of the motion, he had no doubt agents and acqur.iutances in this country whom he could employ for the purpoas of defending him and informing the House why he continued to absent himself. Under these circumstances, he (Mr. Fitzgerald) felt it to be his duty to ask the House to accede to the motion for Mr. Sadleir's expulsion, He did not anticipate that tho House would be unwilling to do so, for the motion was merely a process of self-purgation on the p art of the House. The precedents to which he had referred amply justified the House in taking that step. He believed that the unfortunate man was an outcast and a fugitive, and that he had already imposed upon himself a heavier punishment than any that coald be
inflicted upon him by the House, for he had doomed himself to exile for life. The House, nevertheless, had a duty to perform, and he (Mr. Fitzgerald) trusted that it would unhesitatingly agree to tho motion for the expulsion of Mr. Sadleir. (Hear.) The right hon. and learned gentleman concluded by moving, " That James Sadleir, Esq., a member of this House, having been charged with divers frauds and fraudulent practices, and bills of indictment for certain misdemseanours having been found against him, and warrants issued for his apprehension, andthe said .James Sadleir having failed to obey an order of this House that he should attend in his place on Thursday, the 24th day of July last, and having fled from justice, that the said James Sadleir be ex-pelled this house."
Mr. G. BUTT seconded the motion.
Sir F. TESIGEPR believed that there was no difference of opinion with respect to the motion, and that, as the right hon. and learned gentleman had anticipated, it would be unanimously agreed to. But, as they were about to add another to a list of very disagreeable precedents, it might be as well to lay clearly before the House the reasons for which they were about to do so, in order that those in succeeding times might distinctly understand the case. The House would remember that on the 24th of July last a motion was made by the hon. and learned member for Sheffield for the expulsion of Mr. Sadleir. In support of that motion certain facts were brougbt forward by that bon. and learned gentlemen. Those facts must have been perfectly well known to Mr. James Sadleir hinself. The hon. and learned member for Sheffield quoted various precedents (many of which had been mentioned that evenng by the Attrney-General for Ireland) for the purpose of showing that it was by no means necessarv that expulsion from that House should be preceded by conviction for any offence. Butthe Attorney-General resisted that motion, and the noble lord at the nead of the Government said that it was premature, that there had been no conviction, no confes-
sion, and no report of a committee. The Attorney-General for Ireland addad that if proceedings of outlawry had been begun against Mr. Sadleir, the Rouse might have had some ground for entertiing the motion of the hon. and learned member for 8heffield. But was it not well known at that very time that the Master of the Rolls in Ireland in delivering judgment in a suit had characterized as a ggantic fraud the dealings of lfr. James Sadleir wvith the Ti cerary Bank? There had been proceedings to apprehend hUm, but he had absconded. An indictment for fraud had been commenced against him at the ass=ses, and a true bill found against izm The hon. and learned member for Sheffield therefore insisted that the case against Mr. Sadleir was perfectly ripe for decision, and ho was supported by the right hon. and learned member for the University of Dublin. Now, he (Sir F. Thesiger) wished to know what additional information had been furnislied to the Homse that day by the Attorney-General for Ireland. There had been no conviction, no confession, and no report of a committee. It was true that proceedings in outlawry had been commenced, bat they were so dilato
that theycould not bebroughtto a termination before Michaef. mas term-that was.to say, the month of November next. Could not they retort upon the right hon. and learned gentleman, 1' Wait until yoa have an outlawry, or something to proceed uponr' Bat they thought differently; they thought that the House was in a position, upon these facts, which the right hon. and learned gentleman said were notorious and admitted by aU, to proceed in that way which became its honour anl dignity by expelling the unworthy moember. What additional information had khse right hon. and learned gentleman placed before the House? He thought it right to communicxate to the Eouse of Commons all that was in his power upon the subject, and he extracted from his pocket a private letter, the writer of which, whose name he mentioned, he had informed that he should make use of it unless he heard from him to the contrary. The right hon. and learned gentleman had thought it discreet and prudent, on the part of the Government which he represented to tell Mr. Sadleir that they kner perfectly well where te was to be found, and also to inform him through the ordinary channels that he was perlly safe where he was, because we had no extradition treaty'th that country. Thisthe right hon. and learned gentleman thought was a discreet exercise of his duty to the House and to the Government of which he was a member l This was the only additional piece of information which the House had received, and it would very gladly have relieved the right hon. and learned gentleman from the painful necessity of imparting this information. They were then considering what were the grounds upon vhich thev could properly proceed to expel a member who had shown-himself unworthy to sit in that house, and they found, by the confession of the Government, through its organ, the right hon. and learned gentleman, that there Was no necessity whatever for a confession, no necessity for a conviction, no necessity for the report of a committee of the House of Commons, no necessity that there should be proceedings to outlaw ; but that all those facts which were so powerfuy brought forward by his hon. and learned friend 'he member for Sheffield (Mr. Roebuck) on a former occasion were quite sufficient to Jastify the expulsion of Mr. James Sadleir, and that the numerous precedents upon the subject which were then cited by his right hon. and learned friend (Mr. Napier) went even further than he had asserted in support of this motion. As the House was about to add one to the list of unfortunate precedents with which the right hon. and learned gentleman (Mr. Fitzgerald) had favoured them, he (SirF.The6i6er) had thought itdesirahle that they should per. fectly understand their position. He concurred beartilyhe had almost sad eagerly-in the resolution which tho right hon. and learned gentleman had proposed, and about which he supposed here would not be the slightest differsure of oj,inion. (Hiear, hear.)
Mr. ROEBUCK said that perhaps the House would pardon him for interfering between it and the solicitor-General [who had risen at the same tIme) when it considered the peculiar position in which it stood. He made this same motion last July. It had through life so often been his fate to be told " You are too soon " (a laugh) that he was not surprised at the proceed. ings of to-night, but he was surprised to hear the powerful and convincing speech of his right hon. and learned friend (Sir F. Thesiger). He wished that speech had been delivered on the 24th of July last. (Hear, hear.)
Sir F. THESIGER said he was not present.
Mr. ROEBUCK was son7 that he was not. He (Mr. Roebuck) was then told by his right hon. and learned friend the Solicitor General (Mr. S. Wortley) that he was attempting to establish a dangerous precedent. There were some persons who dealt in decencies for ever, and he hai no doubt that his right hon. friend was not in a position to create a dangerous precedent. He would ask the right hon. gentleman the Attorney-General for Ireland what difference there was between existxng circumstances and those in July last, except as regarded time. (Cheers from the Ministerial benches.) He understood that cheer. He knew whence it came. Last July the House would have said to this man, "You have done that which compromises thehonour of a gentleman. You have been accused by a judge in his place. A grand jury has found a bill against you, and you have not appeared. You have fled from justice." Saying that would have had a moral influence upon society; bub what was the difference now? The only additions made by the right hon. and learned gentleman were the reports from the sheriffs of various counties in Ireland who had sought for this man, and a private letter from Paris; but was there no difference in the moral effect of caling upon a man as a member of that House to answer a charge upon its first blush, and waiting for six month uand making no such demand until their myrmidons had sought and had failed to find him? They could not say that the House of Commons was so tenacious of the character of its members that upon the first blush of a charge they called for their appearance and answer. They gave them time to run away, and they did run away, and then members produced a private letter to prove that they had run away. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) Every grave fact which had been adduced that night was knowrn on the 24th of July last. A judge had chreduJames Sadleir from the judgment seat- a grand jury had found a true bill against i that House had issuet an order that he should appear in is place, and he did not come. Had not all these things been stated that night, and with what addition 7 y, with that miserable addition to which he had alluded-the reports from the sheriffs of different counties of Ireland and a private letter. Were not these the very grounds upon which he (Mr. Roebuck) asked the House to expel this man-he would not cal him gentleman (hear, hear)-he would not cal him an hon. member ? If it had been the case of a duel he could have understood the argument of his right hon. and learned friend the Solicitor-General, who said perhaps -and it was curious how acute and astute lawyers were in finding out a " perhaps"-perhaps he would answer it. He (Mr. Roebuck) knew that in what were caUed affairs of honour-when a man was charged with an offence against the laws of his country in accordance with the laws of honour-he said, " Oh, I don't like to go to prison, but I'll come and answer the charge." But there was a grava difference between such a case and that now in question. There was a charge against a man's morality,-" You have picked the pockets of thousands of poor people (hear, hear) ; you are a thief (hear, hear); you are a swindler; in the eyes of all honest men you are a degraded creature." Would not an honest mau rush to meet such a charge .Would he go away upon the plea that he disliked a p risn? Would not he seek the dungeon rather than bear the stigma of such an imputation ? But said his (Mr. Roebuck's) right hon. and learned friend the Solicitor-General, " Perhaps he does not like to go to prison." He (Mr. Roebuck) supposed he did not. (LJaughter.) Hesupposed the man to have been a thorough rogue. Hle charged him with being so. The charge against him was that his honour was gone, that he was a thief and a swindler- and he would ask what was there in this man which created in his favour such very tender sympathy on the part of the Government ? The time was come when the members of that House ought to look round and see who among tbem were open to such charges (hear, hear), and to exnel all upon whom sucI a stigma could be fixed. A man w o at the very outburst of such a charge did not rush to meet it was unworthy to be a representative (hear, hear), and too tender sympathy for him did not redound to the credit either of that House or of those who put it forward. (Hear, bear.)
The SOLICITOR-GENERAL said he would not long prevent the House from passing from this subject to one which, although not of greater importance than was the bonour and dignity of that House, excited a great deal of interest at the present time; but, as he had been pointedly s31uded to, and as he was the first person who suggested that
elaysndthatcaution whichhad been complained of by his hon. and learned friend opposite (Sir F. Thesiger), and again by his hon. and learned friend below him (Mr. Roebuck), he thought that it was due to the House that he should recall to its recollection that which had been kept a good deal out of sight-viz., what were really the grounds upon which this motion was resisted in July. Eis hon. and learned friend below him (Mr. Roebuck) asked what had happened since but the lapse of time. Why, the whole question which was made in July was one of tim e. (Hear, hear.) The objection to the motion was that it was toe soon, that it wvas premature, that up to that moment Mr. Sadleir had had no opportunity of vindicating himself, that on the previous_Mondlay the Hlouse had ordered him to appear
i his place on Thursday, and on that very Thursday, becanso he did not attend, it was proposed at once to exIel him. The want of time was the very essence of the objection which was taken. (Hear, hear.) He (the Solicitor-General) stated at the time that he fully acceded to the doctrine that that House was not to be tied down by the necessity of a conviction, that it might, apart from mere legal technicalities, acting upon its moral conviction, but acting caUtiously, proceed to the expulsion of a member. He and those who spoke in that sense grounded their opposition upon the want of time and the premature character of the proceediDg. The papers referring to the motion had
een circulated only that morning, and he urged that members ought to have time to look over them. It was at the very end of the session, on the 24th of July, and he certainly imagined what he had now heard from the hon. and learned gentleman opposite (Sir F. Thesiger), that he could not have been present, or he would not have taken the line which he had to-night. [Sir F. Thesiger said that he had read the debates.] In point of fact, it was a period of the session at which there were but few menibers of the legal profession in their places, and that was an additional reason why the decision should have been postponed. It was now said that there was no differ-
ence between the present time and that at which the House rAfused to accede to a motion similar to that now efore it. (Hear.) It was not his duty to vindicate the po°f,n of the House. There was no division. Even his hon.Ad learned friend the member for Sheffield (Mr. Roebuck) dia not take a division, but acquiesced in the motion for the previous question. The ground on which he had resisted the motion of Last session was, that the indictment was found only on the 18th of July, that the order to attend that House was made on the 21st of July, and that the lIouse was called upon on the 24th of that very same month to take the last step of expulsion. He (the Solicitor-General), under those circumstances, said that James Satleir had not had an opportunity of receiving the order of the House; that they did not kn',w that he did not mean to meet the charge; and that, at all events, they should not act with precipitate haste. Since that time Mr. Sadleir had been offered two opportunities of
smeeeing the charge. His right hon, friend the AttorneyGener for Ireland had made a motion in November in the Court of Queen's Bench, when Mr. Sadleir might have appeared on his trial ; and again in the month of January a similar opportunity was afforded to him; but he had availed himself of neither. A new session having therefore oVcEned, and this member of the House not having presented himself to vindicate his character, the matter now stood in an essentially diferent position. (Hear, hear.) It ;was of the utmost importance not merely that they should be cautious in these grave proceedingsi, but thatcthey should essert distinctly that it was not necessary there should he a legal conviction to justify the course about to be taken, o.nd he trusted that the House would adopt with perfect unanimity the resolution now proposed for the defence of its honour.
Mr. WHITESIDE said it was quite true that, when this question was before the House on the 24th of July, the rresent Solicior-General based his opposition on the ground of time. But the right hon. gentleman, and also the noble lord at the head of the Government, then laid down the wholly untenable doctrine that in a case like the present there must be either a conviction, a con. fession, or a formal Parliamentary inquiry. The law eflicers of the Crown went even further, regarding a judgment of outlawry as necessary, and insisting that it would be dangerous and unconstitational to expel James Sedleir on the facts then before the House. It was of the utmost importance that they should understand the prin. ciple on which the House proceeded. It did not act upon a conviction, or an acquittal, or even a pardon. If Her Majesty were graciously pleased to pardon a man, that House, if the paty had behaved unworthily, would still persist in expellhig him. The principle was better stated, in the case of MIr. Walsh, by a lay member of the House than by Sir S. Romilly and the other lawyers who took part in the dis. cussion. It was alleged that it was a rare thing to expel a man for the breach of a pecuniary trust. On this point Mr Bankes was reported in 1812 to have obzerved:-
"A5in.ig all the precedents there were none of more freqc,t occurrence, or which had been visited more unifornuly by the just punishment of the House, than cases of fraud and notorious breach of trust in pecuniary transactions for private and undue emolumente.n....
Ihe hon. gentleman maintained, therefore, that the governing principle upon which the House was called to act was the notoriety of the fact, demonstrable from papers on the table, which showed that it was a gross breach of trust, beyond the power of cavil ordispute; a case of great moral guilt would be enough."
No doubt several lawyes resisted this argument, but their opinions were overruled by the majority of the House. What wasthe case against James Sadleir on the 24th of July ? The documents which the right bon. gentleman had laid on the table contained a statement made by Mr. Kelly, the manager of the Tipperary Bank, to this effect:-
I- In the early part of January, 1856, I received from James Sadleir, at the bank at Clonmel, a letter, dated Lonxdon, December 30, 1855, written to him by John Sadleir, with an enclosure purporting to be a balance-sheet of the affairs of the bank to the 31st of December, 1854. James Sadleir requested me to take the letter and enclosure home and read them. I read the letter and considered the subject, and in a subsequent conversation told James Sadleir that it would be wrong to carry out the views contained in that communication. He acquiesced, and in referenoe to the balance-sheet observed that it was very foolish of John Sadleir to put forward such a document. The balance-sheet
repared in John Sadleir'e handwriting was manifestly raudulent, both as regards the paid-up capital and the assets and liabilities of the bank, and also in the profit and lOss account, all of which are overstated to a vast amount. In May, 1856, Isaw in print, for the first time, a copy of the balance-sheet above referred to, to which my name is attached as manager. Inevernputmy name to the document, or sanctioned it, directly or indirectly, nor did I know of its being in existence, in print, until then."
These disgraceful facts were before the House in July last, and the acknowledgment of guilt implied by flight was as strong then as now. One of the docuuients laid on the table was thoroughly Irish in its character. A letter to the Crown Solicitor fronm the Deputy Inspector-General of the Constabulary, describing the commendable exertions made bythepoicetoexecute thewarrants on JamesSadleir, showed that "a specialwatch was kept (by a man acquaintedwith r. Sadleir's appearance, sentup from Clonmnel for that purpose) both at Bray, where 3lr. Sadleir lodged, and at Kingstownpier, early in the month of July last." Then followed these remarkable words-" Previously to which tine, however
as the police ascertained, Mr. Sadleir had left that place."'
(Laughter.) This was quite correct. 3Ir. Sadleir had locg i left the place; but the police, nevertheless, kept watch on the pier, to gaze out on tLa sea, and enjoy the fresh air for as many days as the Attorney-General directed the sham to be gone through of looking for a man whom everybody knew to have left Ireland in June. " I may add my own beLief (the Crown Solicitor himself stated) and what I fancy is that of most, if not all here, that Mr James Sadleir, 3LP, is not in Ireland, and has not been in Ireland sincethe middle of June." These facts existed and made a strong case, when the Government resisted the motion of the 24th of July last on the ground that there had been no conviction, no confession, and no judgment of outlawry. As soon as the Master of the Rolls had pronounced his judgmeut of the 20th of June Mr. Sadleir had the good sense to obtain legal advice as to whether or not he could be prosecuted. The answer he received to this question fronii one who was not a law officer of the Crown being of course, in the affirmative, he immediately made his preliminary arrangements, and went off to Copenhagen. A letter from the Crown Solicitor to the right hon. gentleman, dated Dublin, the 7th of February last, stated that on the 9th of July, 1356,-
" A telegraph nmessage was sent to vou, inforning you
that an anonymous letter had been received by the metro- i politan police here, in which the writer offered to show i where Mr. James Sadleir then was if a reward would be given. You immediately, by telegraph, desired that the under-Secretary should be consulted, while you advised a liberal reward. 1001. was accordingly offered, and on the 14th a stranger had an interview with Colonel Browne. He stated 'that Mr. Janies Sadleir was then under the assumed name of John Smith at Mulmoe, near Copenhagen, wbere he would remain for five or six days, and thence ho proposed to go through France to America."'
Yet on the 24th of July the objection was taken by the Government that sufficient time to obey the summons of the House had not been given to a man who was going though France to America to escape the consequences of his crimes. There was a strong feeling in Ireland at that time with regard to certain elections, and on the 23d of July a motion
was made before the Lord Chancellor to appoint Mr. i M'Dovell (the official manager, &-c.) as receiver over the property of James Sadleir. The Lord Chancellor said that possession of part of this property could onlv be got at by legal proceedings against James Sadleir. He added that ISadleir was a fugitive from justice. He (the Lord Chancellor) was now authorized to say so, considering what had taken place; and whether he would ever be amenable or not ho did not know. On the 24th of July, however, the Attorney-General resisted James Sadleir's expulsion on the ground that the Hoase could not proceed with safety in the absence of a fornial judgment, which weantnothing less than a repetition of legal quibbles. If the arguments of the Government were good in July last their movement now was premature, for no judgment had yet been pronounced; and he (bir. Whiteside) wvas surprised to hear the SolicitorGeneral for England say that James Sadleir had omitted to avail hiumself of the opportunity of being tried. [The Solicitor-Geiieral here made a remark which was inaudible in the gallery.] lW'hen proceedings were removed to the Court of Queeil's Bench on certiora)-i the usual course adopted iu Ireland was to send down the case to the county assizes, and have it tried there. The next assizes had inot yet arrived, but, notwithstandin,
that, the rigbt lion. gentleman, most inconsistently We maintained. iow called on the House to proceed to the exulsion of Mr. James Sadleir, as a man unfitted by his fraudulent practices to sit among them.
Sir G. GREY thought it was a matter of regret that,in a case where all keeined unauimous, hon. and learnied gentle-
ien opposite should Lhave gone out of their wav to attempt to fix a charge of in'consistency on the Government, and especially on the right hon. gentlemian the Attorney-General for Ireland, and to contrast the course taken last year by the Governnient with th't wlhich they now proposed.(Hear, hear.) Both the ho,i. mnd learned gentlemen had kept out of sight the substantial objection made by the Governmenrt last wear to the Inl tion of the hon. and learned member (Mr. Roebuck), whicih 'vas that there was no evidence to show that Jami. s Sadhiir had had any opportunity of relieving himself from the charge brought against him. That was the aegument used by the then Attorney-General for Eng. land and the Attorney-General for Ireland. They were unvwillin,g to coindemn without inquiry, an.d by a hasty deci'ion to establish a precedent which, whatever was the general op nion of the merits of this case, n.ighit le dangerous for the future. The right hon. gentlelulaii the miiember for Oxfordshire on that occasion eutirely conieu-red in the course proposed by the Government. "The worse the case seems to be," said the right hon. gentlesn,all "the more careful we ought to he not to act utntil the person implicated has had an opportunity of meeting the charge niade against him." That was the opinion of the majority of the Hlouse, and the amotion was rejected. Now, however, the case was different. Ample opportunity had been afforded lor Mar. James Sadleir to
3meet the e-harge. No grotund existed for dloubting this, and the Howei might no.v, without danger of setting an unwise precedent, give its san,ction to the motion propo,ed by his right hon. friend.
Mr. NAPIEPI said he had a distinct recollection that the ground of opposition to the motion of the hon. and learned memnber for Sheffield taken both by the Attorney-General for Exigland and the Attorney-General for Ireland was, that the House ought to have actual proof of the guilt of Mr. James Sadleir, either by his conviction or confession. No one could he more convinced of that now than he was in the month of July last, when the first motion for expuLdion was made. The Y-onso would have been perfectly justified then in expelling Mr. Janes Sadleir, but it would urobably not have been so politically convenient. (Hear, hear.)
The motion was tben agreed to.
TaEL BUDGET,
On the order of the day for going into Conimittee of Supply being read,
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said,-Before
I move, Sir, that you do leave the chair, it may be convenienttlht I should state, for the information of those members wio are not accuratr'T acquainted with the mode Of proceeding on money votes, what course I intend to pursue with reference to this matter. The act of Parliament under which the Exchequer-bonds which are referred to in the
lesolution moved by soe in Committee of Supply on Friday night were issued contains this provision-" The principal moneys secured by such bonds shall be repaid out of such moneys as shall be provided by Parliament at par." The comeequence in that the Government would not be provided with any funds to meet these2,000,OOOL of Exchequer-bonds
vi2hout going tbrough three operations-first, obtaining a vote in Committee of Supply, next a votein Ways and Means
to cover the vote of supply, and, thirdly, a Ways and Means act which would cover the vote of supply, together with that of ways and means. Until these three forms are gono through it would not be competent for the Govrenment to pay off the 2,000,0001. of Exchequer-bonds which fall due this year, and if the House should determine to discharge the obligation by repayment it will be necessary to provide the funds in the way I have mentioned. My statement on Friday night was made in Committee of Supply, which is contrary to the usual practice, and I concluded by a motion for a vote of supply to provide for the payment of this 2,000,0001. That is the only vote which I intend to propose in the present Committee of Supply. For the convenience of the House I circulated on Friday the resolutions on the income-tax, together with the scale of duties which I intended to propose on tea and sugar, but by some accident for which I am not responsible those resolutions were not printed as a separate paper, but were confused with the other votes. I believe, however, that the votes of the night are accurately printed. I merely mention this for the purpose of guarding the House against the supposition that it would be competent for me to move those resolutions in Committoe of Supply; they can only be moved in Committee of Ways and Means, and a Committee of Ways and Means cannot be appointed until a vote has been taken in Committee of Supply. Whenever the House shall think fit to concur in the resolution which I moved on Friday, it will then be competent to appoint a Committee of Ways and Means, and when that committee is appointed I shaU be prepared to proceed with those resolutions.
Air. DrSRAELL-It was the common understanding, I believe, Sir, on Friday that we were to have an opportunity to-night of discussing and, if necessary, of asking the opinion of the House on the whole tenour and scope of the financial scheme of the Government. On looking at the paper of business for.to-night I observed the resolutions to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has jest alluded, which, if they had been brought forward to-night-as it appeared they were to be-would have given us that oppor. tunity; but 'when I came down to the house I found that the paper was changed, and though I accept, of course without the slightest hesitation, the account given by the right hon. gentleinan of the inadvertence, yet the right hon. gentleman must feel that it has occasioned great inconve. nience to the House. (Hear, hear.) It appears tome extremely desirable that an early opportunity should be afforded of entering upon this discussion. (Hear.) I did not quite collect from the right hon. gentleman when he proposed that that opportunity should be offered, but tomorrow the resolution which is about to be put in Committee of Supply wiU have to be reported, and I should then propose, if that course should be agreeable to the House, to move a resolution, in which I would ask the opinion of the House, which would raise the whole question of the finaccial scheme of the Government. With the permisiion of the House, I will read the resolution which I propose to move. It is as follows:-
" That, in the opinion of this House, it would be expe. dient, before sanctioning the financial arrangements for the ensuing year, to adjust the estimated income and expenditure in the manner which shall appear beat calculated to secure the country against the risk of a deficiency in the years 1858.9 and 1859-60, and to provide such a balance of revenue and charge respectively in the year 1860 as may place it in the power of Parliament at that period, without embarrassment to the revenue, altogether to remit the income-tax."
(Hear.) If it bo agreeable to the HouseI shall propose thisas an amendment to the report being brought up, and the discussion which might otherwise have taken place to-night may then take place. (Hear, hear.)
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUIER.-I only rise to say that if the right hon. gentleman would prefer to make his niotion to-night, or any statement in Committee of Supply, I shall be perfectly ready to meet it by such explanations as the case may require. (Hear, hear.)
Sir J. PAKINGTON. -I apprehend that, in the event of that course being taken, my right hon. friend (Mr. Disraeli) would not, in point of form, have power to move the amendment of which he has given notice. (Hear, hear.)
The SPEAKER.-In Committee of Supply it would be againmt the rules of the House to move an amendment with reference to the expenditure of the country.
The motion that the Speaker leave the chair was being put, when
Mr. GLADSTONE rose and said,-I entirely accede to the convenience of the arrangement which has been made. I understand my right hon. friend (the Chancelor of the Exchequer) to say that he does not propose to move any resolution in Committee of Supply except a resolution with respect to Exchequer bonds. It therefore follows that the navy estimates stand over to a future evening. [Sir G. Grey.-No; the navy estimates wil be moved by the First Lord of the Admiralty.] It appears to me that lies at the root of the whole matter. (Cheers from the Opposition.) I shall not be prepared to assent to the motion that you, Sir, leave the chair to go into committee on the navy estimates until an opportunity has been afforded of considering fuly the financial proposals of the Government. (Cheers.) I am aware that if I sit down I have no power of rising again to address the House. (Laughter.) I am unwiling, therefore, to lose or surrender a vantage ground until I understand from the Government what they intend to do. It appears to me that the sub. jects of Supply and AVays and Means are essentialy connected. (Hear, hear.) Her Majesty's Government with perfect propriety, yielding to the general wish of the House, have so connected them, and in the statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer the two subjects, contrary to practice, and on special grounds, have been placed before us together. The ordinary practice according to which the principal charges are voted before going into Committee of Ways and Means has been departed from, and, that being so, it appears to me it is a fair demand for members to make, if they think their public duty requires them to urge such demand, that they should have the power of discussing the question as a whole. (Loud cheers.) That demand, for my own part and as an individual member, I make with due respect and humility, but with as much urgency and conviction of duty as I ever made any demand in this house. (Cheers.) It is, in my opinion, eesential to the right discharge of our duties with regard to the finances of the country that we should have an opportunity of discussing the proposals of the Government as a whole. (Hear, hear.) It is perfectly plain-beyond the possibility of dispute-that if we proceed to take a vote on the navy estimates we shaU lose the opportunity of an unprejudiced discussion of the whole scheme. (Hear, hear.) I do not wish to detaiis the House with arguments on a matter so plain that it does not require them; but I, for niie, not knowing what may be the opinion of other hon. members, caiinot consent to your leaving the chair for the purpose of goinig into Committee of Supply unless it is understood that thIe resolution of the Chancelor of the Exchequer is the only resolution which is to be moved tonight. (Cheers.)
Lord J. IUSSELL.-I only rise to say that I hope, before the House resolves into Committee of Supply, the Government will declare whether they decidedly mean to go into the Navy Estimates to-night. (Hear, hear.) I own it appears to me that what my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford has said is very reasonable, and I cannot wel conceive that going into a question of the Navy Estimates and voting several large sums, andcthen coming afterwards on another day to a discussion of the general expenditure of the country, can be a convenient course. (Hear, hear.) It is perfectly fair for the right hon. the Chancelor of the Exchequer to move the resolution lie has prepared, and hon. gentlemen can either assent to it or not before an opportunity is given them of expressing an opinion on the plan stated the other night; but to go into committee on the Navy Estimates is very unreasonable (cheers), and immediately the committee come to that point I shal feel compelled to take such a course as wiU induce the House to resume, or at least not to come to a vote on that subject. (Loud cheers.)
Lord PALhLERSTON.-To save the House trouble we will adopt the course which the House seems to prefer. We will not go into tie navy estimates to-night. (Laughter.)
The motion was agreed to, and amid some confusion from the noise of members leaving and conversing, theHouse went into Committee of Supply.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCEEQUER.-Before I proceed to offer to the committee explanations which wilt have reference to thIe terums of the motion which has lately been road by the right hon. gentleman opposite, I will advert to a point mentioned by the right hon. gentleman the member for the Unsiversity of Oxford on Friday, which I left unansw ered. He asked me whether I had included in the estimate which I made of taxes remitted since 153 the Fum of 165,0001., the difference on foreign bils of exchange. The amount I stated didinclude that item. It was, however, on the assumption of being the produce of changes in the assessed taxes which took place in 1854 that I included it ia taxes remitted since 1853. Inasmuch as it is quite true, as the right hon. gentleman stated, that he announced that change in 1853, which fact I had overlooked, I ought not to have included it, and the sum I stated must be rectified by the omission (as wounderstood) of 220,0001. I now come to the material point raised by the intended resolution of the zight hon. gentleman as to any supposed deficiency in the revenue for two years after the ensuing year to be creatod by the financial arrangements submitted to the House on Friday last. I do not understand that it is alleged that tho revenue estimated for the coming year, beginning the 1st of April next, will be deficient. If it is I will re-oxplain that
statement; bat unless it is alleged that the revenue will be insufficient to meet the estimated expenditure I will assume that there is no doubt as to the ensuing year. (HIear hear.) What I coUect to be affirmed is, that the financial arrangements wvhich I propose will leave a deficiency of revenue as Compared with expenditure in the years 1858-9 and 1859-60. I believe I am correctly rendering the effect of the resolution read by the right hon. gentleman. (Mr. Disraeli by gesture signified assent.) I hold in my hand the best estimate which I have been able to make of the revenue and expenditure for those years, according to the plan which I submitted to the House on Friday. If the committee woald wish to hear the estimate of each item for those two years 1 will read ib to them. (Hear, hear.)

liabilities.58,800,000 58,765,000
Well, now the gross expenditure for 1853-4was 55,840,0001., and therefore, according to my estimate of revenue and expenditure for these two years, after discharging all liabilities, exclusive of the Exchequer-bonds, there will be an excess beyond the expenditure of the l ast year before the war of about 3,000,0001. The whole of this 3,000,0001. will be applicable to the increased charge of the army, the navy, and the civil service, with the single deduction of the increased interest upon the debt, which has been created during the war. These liabilities are in the natare of the repayment of the principal, but there is also an augmentation of the interest upon the debt incurred during the war. The increaseil charge of the funded and unfunded debt beyond the charge for the year 1853-4 will be in 1858-9 6W0,0001., which will be reduced in 1869-60 to 510,0001. There will, therefore, be a margin of 3,000,0001., from which nothing is to be taken, except that payment of the interest to cover the increased expenditure of the arny, navy, and civil service beyond that of the last years of the peace. It seems to me that this will be a very sufficient margin for these two years. The House wil see that this estimate of revenue is not a sanguine estimate. I have not calculated upon any increase in the indirect taxes, although when Parliament remits so large a sum as 9,000,0001. of direct taxation we may, under ordinary circumstances, reasonably expect a great Increase in the produce of the indirect taxation. (Hear, hear.) Unless, therefore, it can be shown that there is some error in this estimate, which I believe cannot be pointed out, I have proved that I have provided a sufficient revenue for the years 1858-9 and 1809-60. That is the point to which the resolutions of the right hon. gentleman (ra. Disraeli) are directed, and it would be, I think, more convenient to discuss that question at present, without waiting for the resolution or report to be brought up.
Mr. GLADST0ONE.-I entirely accede to the propriety of the resolution which the ChanceUor of the Exchequer is about to move. I thought it better that we should have a day to think about it, but, as far as I am concerned, I have not a word of objection to the resolution itself, which I hope wil be unanimously agreed to. The other portion of the right hon. gentleman's speech properly be. longed, I think, to the speech he delivered on Friday night, and would have been introduced into it, no doubt, bht for the great circuit the right hon. gentleman was compelled to make, and the numerous subjects which prevented him from making his estimates for future years. While I am sorry to say I cannot accept the cheering prospect which he has held out to us for future years, yet the same considera. tions which led us to postpone the vote of Friday night ought also to induce us to postpone to-night the discussion of that most important and vital portion of the question-the prospect of the balance of revenue and expenditure in the years following 1807-4. I wil eserve altogether for another opportunity the remarks I shall have to make, when we shall be botter able to do justice to a question of such vital moment.
Sir F. BARNG.-I see an increase in the revenue charges upon which I should like to have some explanation. There appears to be an increase of 92,0001. in the collection of the revenue, besides the Coastguard service, which is transferred from that estimate.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER'-The estimate of expenditure for the year 1857-S is 4,215,0001., but there is also to be trausferred to this item for the first time the superannuation of the revenue department, which amounts to 475,0001.
Mr. GIBSON.-There are two wars that we are now carrying on, and I wish to know whether the Government intend to lay upon the table the estimate of the expenses to be incurred during the next year in the Persian war? We have the expenses of the Persian war up to the 1st April, but there is no estimate for the future. I wish to ask whether we are to have any further estimate, and also whether there is to be any estimate of the expenses now going on in the war with China ?
The CEANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-It is not our intention to lay upon the table any estimate for the ex penses of the Persian war for the year commencing on the 1st of April, for we have no dea by which we can with probability conjecture what those expenses might be. The House has been already informed that negotiations are going on at Paris with the Persian Minister, and we have every reason to hope that those negotiations will prove satisfactory. If so, no expenses will be incurred beyond those connected with the expedition. The Chinese war has been called a war by the right hon. gentleman, but no extraordinary expenditure has been incurred beyond that of the ships on the station.
hIr. GIBSON.-These wars are going on without the authority of Parliament, and without our knowing anything about them. If the right hon. gentleman would ask for a vote of credit the question could then be raised.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQJUER.-As soon as there is any prospect of extraordinary expenditure we shall submit an estimate to the House.
Mr. DISRAELI.-I have no wish to oppose the resolution ; but it would be greatly for the convenience of the House that we should come to an understanding on what day we shall discuss the whole of the financial arrangements of the Government. If on Friday the Chancellor of the Exchequer will, in Committee of Ways and Means, move his income-tax resolutions, that will be a convenient day to those who sit on this side of the house; and I will on that day move my resolution as an amendment. I only wish that there should be a clear understanding on the subject.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-It will not be competent to go into Committee of Ways and Means tomorrow, and I suppose the House would not wish to take this committee on Wednesday. (Hear, hear.) Friday is therefore the earliest day on which it is possible that these resolutions can be taken. The resolutions have been printed, and I shall be prepared on Friday, in Committee of Ways and Means, to move resolutions on the income-tax and on the tea and sugar duties.
Mr. DISRAELI.-Then I will take that opportunity of moving the resolution that I have read as an amendment to those resolutions.
In reply to a question from Sir H. WILLOUGHBY,
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCEEQUEER was understood to say that he believed about 2,000,0001. of the Exchequer-bonds were held by the Savings Banks Commissioners.
The motion that a sum not exceeding 2,000,0001, be granted to Her Majesty to pay off and discharge Exchequerbonds, issued under the provisions of the act 17th of Victoria, chap. 23, and dated the 8th of May, 1854, which will he due and payable on the 8th of May, 1857, was then agreed to, and the Hfouse resumed.
CHIEF CONSTABLES BILL
Sir G. GREY moved the second reading of this bill.
Mlr. BUCK observed that very few boroughs had joined with counties in forming an amalgamated police force, and the reason probably was that the municipal authorities of boroughs had no voice in those assemblies bywhichthe chief constables were a pointed. He suggested tnat the mayors of all boroughs which formed a joint police with counties should have the right of deliberating with the county magistrates upon matters affecting the police force and voting at the election of chief constables.
The bill was then read a second time, and was ordered to be committed on Wednesday.
ROYAL MARINE FORCES' BILL. This bi went through committee.

iSr. COWPER obtained leave to bring in a bill to con| firm c, k provisional orders of the ~General Board of H ealth applying the Public Health Act, 1848, to the districts of Ipewrich, Oldbury, Stroud, Liangollen, and Dukinfield, and for altering thle constitation of the Local Board of ;eallth for the main sewerage district of Wisbech and

On the motion of Mr. GRoGAN a return was ordered of the name, date of appointment, and saary of the presidents, vice-presidents, fellows, and professors of the Queen's Colleges in Cork, Belfast, and Galway respectively * if there be any official residence, or allowanoe instead of a residence, provided for such presidents, vice-presidents, fellows, and

BANK ACTS COMMITTEE.
The CEANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER moved that the names of Mr. Weguelin and hr. Blackburn be added to this committee.
Mr. CAYLEY thought it was somewhat objectionable that the Governor of the Bank of England, who would be one of the principal witnesses as to the operation of the Bank Charter Act, should be placed upon the committee. He (Mr. Cayley) wished to know whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer would object to the motion of which he had given notice, that the committee should consist of 26 mnembers?
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUEER replied, that he had before expressed his readiness to increase the number of the committee to 22, and with that object he had submitted the names of Air. 'Weguelin and Mlr. Blackburn to the House. He did not see the force of the objection urged by the hon. member for Yorkshire against the nomination of the Governor of the Bank of England, but for his own part he thought the fitness of that gentleman to serve on the committee would be generally recognized. He (the Chancellor of the Exchequer, must also remind the hon. member for Yorkshire that it was by no means unusual to examine members of committees as witnesses, and he would therefore feel it his duty to press his motion. Withregard to the sugg5sted increase in the number of the committee, if it was the wish of the House that such an increase should take place, he would make no objection. (Hear, hear.)
The motion for the addition of Mr. Weguelin and Mr. Blackburn to the committee was then agreed to.
Mr. GROGAN then moved that the committee do consist of 23 members, and that Mr. Vance be added to the committee.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER thought that before the House agreed to reduce the committee to 23 members they ought to come to some resolution as to whether it ought not to consist of 25 or 26.
Mr. CAYLEY thought the committee ought not to be less tbL n 26 in number, folowing in that respect the precedent of 1848. He should, however, have preferred a commission to a comnittee. He certainly thought the committee was not fairly constituted, as 15 of its members were taken from the MAfinisterial side of the house, and out of the gentlemen nominated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer who sat on the last committee seven belonged to the Government side and only four to the Oppositioa side. As it would be unfair to have two to one upon the committee in favouar of a particular set of opinions, he thought he should be justified in the motion he intended to make. that the committee do consist of 26 members, and that Mr. Laing, Mr. Edward Ball, and Mr. James M'Gregor be added to the committee.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, he felt he should be doing an injury to the feelings of the hon. member for Dablin (Mr. Vance) if he again resisted the motion that he be added to the committee., He would therefore ask the House to agree to the followin arrangement-that the committee consist of 24 instead of 22 members, and that Mr. Vance and Mr. Laing be added to the committee. (Eear, hear.)
The motion of Mr. GROGAN was then negatived, and the question put that the committee do consist of 21 members.
Mr. CAYLEY opposed the motion, on the ground that the committee was unfairly constituted. If the right hon. gentleman had not sufficient confidence in his own proposition to press it to a division he could [not have a very good opinion of its merits.
Mr. W. WILLIAMS was of opinion that there were too many members upon the committee.
it Mr. W. EWART also thought a smaU committee would be better than a large one, and that all committees ought to be appointed by a committee of selection, or some authority which should be re-ponsible for their nomination.
Mr. J. L. RICARDO observed that, although the majority of the members of the committee were of one opinion, the minority differed upon most points, not only from the maority, hut also from each other. He doubtedwhether the committee would be able to arrive at any fair conclusion during the present se8sion.
The motion for the enlargement of the committee to 24 members was then agreed to, and Mr. Vance and Mr. Laing were added.
The House adjourned at 20 minutes past 7 o'clock.

Sir,-In l'e Timcs of the 12th inst. an article appeared stating that the Belgian mail steamer Diamant had ran ashore eastward of the harbour at Ostend, on the morning of the 7th inst.
As this report is entirely false, you would much oblige by inserting a contradiction of it in your next number.
The real facts of the case are these:-The Diamant, which left Dover onthe 6th inst. at 11 30 p.m., with the mils for Ostend, had great difficulty in making out Ostend harbour, owing to the nunsual density of the fog; several times, as is the general practice under such circumnstances, the vessel wvas taken as near the shore as possible, in order to find out is accurate posiion, hut finally the commander had to send the small boat on shore, by which much time, of course, Was lost.
It was about 8 am. when the Ostend pier was made out.

uapeculatrOn was marked by several important incidents, and the betting throughout the afternoon shifted and varied in a most perplexing manner.
So strong was the oppo3ition arrayed against Blink Bonny for the Derby that 21 to 1 was offered against her. This mare has of late been under considerable suspicion, and this afternoon she seemed about to be driven completely oat of the market. Her sometime supporters made only a feeble effort to arrest her downward tendency. Early in the afternoon 12 to I to a " pony" was betted against her and Lady Hawthorn coupled. No other investment in her favour came under our notice. Offers were made to back either Tournament or M.D. against her; 20 to 1 to money would have been taken about Mr. Parr's horse; 1,000 to 20 was taken three times about Blink Bonny's stable companion StratImnaer. The odds quoted against Kent were booked to about 2001.; 1,000 to 30 was laid onre.
For the Liverpool Steeple Chase 8 to 1 was at first offered on the field, but those odds were ultimately taken freely about Minos. Hopeless Star rose to 12 to 1, and Omar Pasha was in brisk demand at 100 to 8. Weathercock, who at the end of last week had been brought with some force into the market, was well supported at 100 to 6. The following were backed for 1001. even against the field :-Minos, Emie:rant, Hopeless Star, Omar Pasha, Weathercock, Jean du Quesne, Little Charley, and Casse Cou.
The betting on the Chester Cup was remarkable only for the steady support conceded to the favourite. At the price quoted he was backed for about 300W
The transactions on the Lincoln and other events were in smallsums.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Slr,-I am as unwillng to give my time as you must be your space to a controversy with hIr. Smith as to the value of the report aboat Franklin's expedition, received from the Red River settlement. The publio are as well able to judge of it as Mr. Smith Sir George Simpson, or myself, since the value of the report depends not upon our opinions, but the fact whether or not Sir G. Simpson ever received such a communication from Mr. Anderson, the only person capable of estimating what it is worth.
I cannot accuse myself of maldng any charge against Sir George Simpson. I aoted as I thoaght right towards my friends in the lost expedition, without reference to the opinions of any man.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

P.S. The fact of Indians bringing the report shows that the detachment which reached the Great Fish River pushed on into the Indian country. Time will prove whether they starved, wero murdered, orstil exist.
TO THE EDITOR OF TE TIMES.
Sir,- I beg to state that I place implicit reliance on the statement of the Indians, communicated to you by Captain Sherard Osborn, and published in your impression of Saturday, that "they had seen two or more encampments of whites on an island on some point where Anderson and Stewart turned back in 1855, traces of about 10 or 12 men " and that the letter of.Mr. Smith, the secretary of the Hudson's Bay Company, published in your impression of to-day, is no contradiction, inasmuch as he is unacquainted with the fact that the Chipewyan Indians ever since the year 1835 have hunted on the banks of the Great Fish River, and have entered into friendly relations with the Esquimaiux.
Mr. Roderick M'Leod,-one of the officers of the expedition in search of Sir J. Ross in 1S33-35, wrote to me from Great Slave Lake on the 2d of July, in 1836, as follows:-
I It may perhaps be in faveur of your enterprise,' the late hntimacy that has taken place between tho Chipewyans and Esquimaux tribes in the course of the last summer on the Thlewee-dezza (is3h River) . among the latter were many inhabitants of the Thlewce-cho-der% (Great Fish River), but the majority were those that frequent Churchill annuauy; to prove which they produced the articlos they obtained from the comDany's storc3 in the way of trado, and readily exchanged the same with their guests by way of cementing their friendship, and I have rea5on to suppose it wil continne uninteruptedt now that the former have become sensible of the errors of their DncetOrS. Ther can be no doubt of a sucoeseful issue to yoer nndertaking, of which I feel so confident that I hail wlth pleasure the moment that wil bring yon once more amuong us, as I am equally certain that every attention will be directed to promote yoer views, and be asaure none shal more wiUingly contribute thereto than your humble servant."
I can assure you, Sir, the want of knowledge which the Governors of the Hudson's Bay Company, arising from the form of their constitution, possess of their own vast territory is such that, putting aside the necessity of a further search for Franklin, to guard the national honour, an ex: ploring expedition is imuperatively caUed for in reference to a renewal of their charter, which is now before Parlia. ment.
I have the honour to be. Sir, Tour faithful RnrvAnt

Vaccination And Smallpox.
VACCINATION AND SMALEPOX.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I beg a word of explanation with reference to my letter upon the above subject which appeared in The Tines some days since, and to some remarks upon it by Mr. Marson, surgeon of the Smallpox and Vaccination Hospital, which I have just seen in your paper of the 12th inst.
Having attributed to me a certain opinion (probably a mistaken one) with respect to a cause of the failure of vaccination which I cited in my letter, Mr. Marson announces his conviction that I am " not practically acquainted with the subject I have undertaken to write upon." My acquaintance with the subject is, of eourse, not of a medicaUy professional character, and is only so far "practical" as a somewhat close and frequent observation of smaUlpox cases during the last twelvemouths can make it. It bas led me to believe, however, that the abstraction of lymph from the vaceine pustule is a cause which is occasionally alleged for the subsequent appearance of smallpox, to which therefore MIr. Marson will find that I refer in my letter without any intimation of the amount of credit which I am disposed to attach to it. I will only add that Mr. Afarson's unquestionably large and practical acquaintance with the subject has led him, nevertheless, into a mistaken hypothesis with respect to the case alluded to in my letter. He assumes that the child had taken smallpox before it was vaccinated; the factis, that three years intervened between an apparently highly sueeessfut vaccination and the appearance of smnallpox in a severe form in Milay last. Requlesting a place in your columns for this explanadion,
I have the honour to be. Sir. vonr nh Airn, e,ro,.a~

Another Loss Of Life In Shetland.-Once
ANOTHER Loss OF L11m i° SHXTJA m -Once more are we called on to hear the cry of distress from Shet. land. Another boat-the fourth in about two months-has been lost, and three men drowvned. A correspondent gives us the particulars as follows :-" Another of those melancholy accidents which we have had so often to report this season has occurred at- Burra, by which three liies hare been lost, and their dependent relatives left in great distress. The male population of Burra are moetly fishermen, and whenever the weather is at all moderate they ply their avocation at all seasons of the year. On Tuesday last most of the boats were off as usual, and one of them, whose crew consisted of four men, was upset. One of the men was picked up by the crew of another boat, but the other three unfortunately sank bef.ore assistance could be rendered them." Another correspondent says :-"On returning from the long hine fishing, on the 29th ult., under sail, with a heavy sea running, theboat was struck by a sea. Sail was immediately taken in, wben another sea struck the boat and filled her with water, and she upset, Walter Williamson, House, Burra, skipper of the boat, was drowned, leaving a widow and large family; Lawrence Smith, also married, and leavit.g a large family, was drowned; George Leask was picked up alive, but died soon after: James Jamieson. a
young man, wa, saved. Yhis sad event, coming so soon after three others all involving such a sad sacrifice of humar life, has created an intense feeling in the district."Northctn BlsigmL
FOOL-HARDY FEAT.-An extraordinary feat of horsomanship was performed in our city on Wednesday night by Mr. Courtney, of BaUyedmond, county of Cork. In pur. suance of a wager, laid for a considorable sum with a brother member of the Kilkenny Hunt Club-Captain Bernard, it is said-wbile at supper in the clubhouse, he sent for his well-known gray horse White Lion, and, having mounted the animal in the clubhouse hail, proceeded deliberately to ride upstairs-two flights-into the club-room, round the supper table, and, having leaped a firescreen, set op for the purpose in his route, he rode down stairs again m perfect safety, and without White Lion once stumbling or evincing for a moment the slightest indication of a sense that he was called on to perform any uncommon feat. The wager was cleverly won, to the admiration of all the beholders. The difficulty and danger of riding dowa stairs in particuLar -*ere largely enhan:z1 by the csrcunistance of each step being bound with thick plates of brass, on w;hich had the iionshod foot of the sanmal once come, it would have been impossible that he could have kept his legs under himL-

London, Tuesday, February 17, 1857.
ZONDO2, TUBSDAY, FBBRUARY 17, 1857.
In the House of Lords last night,
The Earl of ALBEHARLE, in answer to an appeal from Lord CLARENDON, consented to postpone for a few days his motion on the Persian war.
Lord MON'TEAGLE moved for the correspondence relating to the deed of gift by which Mr. SIEEPSHANRS had presented his pictures to the nation, and spoke in high praise of the munificent spirit which had been shown in that and similar donations.
Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY replied in fitting terms, and concluded by laying the correspondence on the table.
Lord CAMJPBELL presented a petition calling the attention of the flouse to the case of " DAVISox and DuNcAN" and the law of libel as it now stood. The noble Lord then expressed his opinion that the law ought to be altered, though, as the judges sat on the bench not to make, but to declare the law, it was impossible for them to come to any other decision than that given in the case in point.
Their Lordships then adjourned. In the Rouse of Comnons,
Mr. J. D. FITzGERALD moved a resolution that AMrr. JAI xS SADLEIR, member for Tipperary, having been charged with frauds and fraudulent practices, and bills of indictment for misdemeanours having been found against him, aud warrants issued for his apprehension, and having failed to obey an order of this Rouse that he should attend in his place, and having fled from justice, he be expelled the House. There could be no doubt, he observed, of the privilege or power of the House to take this course without being bound by strict technical rules; and he recited various precedents in which this power had been exercised, laying particular stress upon the case of Mr. (lRonGE RoBINso-, in 1732, who, having been charged with fraudulent practices, had fled beyond seas, and was expelled, although no proof of his guilt was before the Rouse. Re then detailed the history of Mr. SADLEIR'S case, insisting upon the notoriety of the proceedings, and that there could be no doubt that he was aware of the-charges against him. He read reports of the strenuous and unremitting exertions of the constabulary and police to discover and apprehend him, and also a letter, dated at Paris on the 12th of February, stating that Mr. SADLEIR was resident in that city. Under these circumstances he caUed upon the Rouse to perform the office of self-purgation by proceeding to the expulsion of an uniworthy member.
Sir F. TnmSiGEB observed that there could be no difference of opinion regarding the resolntion, in which the House must be eager to concur; but the ground of proceeding should be well understood, and he wished to know how the case of Mr. SADLEiR now differed from its position on the 24th of July, I when the Government resisted the motion of Mr. ROEBUCK for his expulsion.
Mr. ROEBUICK urged the same question.
The SOLICIToR-GrNEnAL defended the suggestion he had made last session, that there should be further delay, on the ground that Mr. SADLEIR had not then had sufficient opportunity to meet the charges.
Mr. WHITESIDE censured the dilatory proceedings of the Government in this case, and contended that it was as clear and strong and full on the 24th of July as it was now.
Sir G. GRBV justified the Government from the charge of inconsistency. The objection to the motion last session was, he said, that there was no evidence that Mr. SADLELR had any opportunity of vindicating himself.
After some remarks by Mr. NxApir, the motion was agreed to Kern. COm.
On the question of going into a Committee of Supply a discussion arose upon a question of form, in the course of which Mr. DiSRA;I read a notice of a resolution he intended to propose, the object of which was to affirm the expediency of so adjusting the incomne and expenditure as would best secure the country against the risk of a deficiency in the years 1858-59 and 1859-UO.
Mr. GLADSTON1E protested against any vote upon the Navy Estimates that night, or until the House had an opportunity of discussing the financial statement as a whole.
Lord PALMERSTON said no vote upon the estimates would be taken that night.
The Rouse then went into a Committee of Supply, wben
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCrurQUEit, in moving a vote of 2, 000,0001. to pay off Exchequer-bonds, gave certain explanations of his financial statement which had been called for on Friday night, and read astatement of the details of the estimated revenue and expenditure for the years 1858-59 and 1859-60, With the view of showing that the apprehensions of Mr. DIsnANu, of a deficiency were groun .lless.
Af:er a few words from Mr. GLADSTOqE and Sir F. BARING the resolution was agreed to.
The CHANCEL.LoR of the ExcHEquQER gave notice that he would on Friday, in a Committee of Ways and Meais, propose his resolutions on the incometax and the duties on tea and sugar.
Mr. DISRAELI said he shlould then move his resoI lution by way of amendment.
When the House resuamed, the Chief Constable
Bill was read a second time, and the Royal 3arine Forces Bill passed through committee.
i Mr. CowPEB obtained leave to bring in abill to con;firm certainprovisional orders of the Board of Health. I Additions were made to the Bank Acts Commit.
tee, the number of which, after some discussion, was fixed at 24.
The House adjourned at 20minutea past 7 o'clock.

It must be confessed that Governments have
It mut be confessed that Governments have their characteristic utterances. We know the voice of Washington and the notes that proceed from Berlin; we are familiar enough with the accents of Queen VIcToBR.A; we can distinguish between the speech of a Russian Emperor and that of the Emperor of the FBxNcn. A thousand years hence the style, the subjects, the turn of thought wiU refer each one of these documents to its nation, even without the assistanceof circumstantial or personal allusions. Our neighbours are of a philosophical race, and accordinglytheir Sovereign, beside announcing measures and pronouncing opinions, enunciates and explains the doctrine of progress as not without its sacrifices. For our part we are always obliged to any one who wil remind people that enterprise is not an unmixed good, that science is not omnipotent, that the best policy has its failures, and that Governments have duties to the weak and unfortunate. The faster we advance the more will be thrown out of the race, breathless, tottering, and altogether distanced. Sometimes these are unwelcome forebodings, but sometimes they are forced upon us. At this moment, on both sides the Channel we see a certain amount of distress, which an unprecedented development of the national resources, so far from preventing, seems even to have aggravated. HEm MAJESTy made no allusion to a state of things which here is not very serious, which promises soon to mend, and which everybody understands. There are people who never say that which there is no occasion to say, even though their silence is sometimes remarkable; and the most prudent of this class would hardly notice a word too much in the list Address from our Throne. On the contrary, the Emperor of the F=NcH is copious and eloquent in accounting for any similar state of things in his country, and is offering scientific consolation and more substantial hopes of relief. It is true that commerce, and society itself, are thrown out of gear by the rapidity of the universal movement. Machines, railways, new currents of trade, the infux of gold, the indefinite expansion of credit, and other elements of an unprecedented prosperity, leave many unfortunates aground, high and dry, demanding in vain that circumstances shall be adjusted to their own diffidence or incapacity. In France the metropolis first accumulates the redundant labour of the provinces, and then proves unable to fulfil its own promises to the starving crowd. What can be done when prosperity itself is the principal defaulter? There is a well-known satire which describes prosperity as cutting its own throat. That prosperity was one founded chiefly on the extravagant expenditure of a ruinous war, and it rested on a protective and even prohibitory system of trade. Under natural circumstances prosperity is not suicidal, and therefore the Emperor of the FRFNcH may safely refer the less fortunate to the general increase of wealth and the consequently increased means and opportunities of profitable emulomvAnt
But, if the ErPEROR recommends the study of political economy, it is fortunately in his power to render the adviee more palatable than it might have been under other circumstances. The addition of eight millions sterling of our money to the ordinary revenue siince the restoration of the Empire has enabled France to bear easily the expenses of the war. They will be entirely discharged out of the proceeds of the loans already authorized, and it is hoped there wiU be no deficiency in the Budget of 1858. Several taxes are selected for abolition, and their place is to be partialy supplied by a new tax on personal property, intended to place it somewhat more on a level in this respect with house and land. On the whole, taxation is to be reduced, without, however, bringing it below the wants of the State. The EriPBRor. announces a reduction in the annual contingent to the army, but a special grant for increasing the pay of the lower ranks. For the same reason, the dearness of provisions, he considers it necessary to raise the salaries of the Civil Service, the members of which have had to bear great privations, and have done so with much patience and patriotism. He announces a reduction in the Army and Navy Estimates, and economy in the public works now in progress, not, however, so as to stop them. The project of a new Transatlantic packet line threatens another competi
tion inthegreat ocean race. Such announcements cannot but remind us of the simailarity of circumstances between us and our neighbours, notwithstanding our cdifferences of political constitution. England and France share the same exigencies, the same aspirations, and the same defects. France, too, has her question of secondary punishments. The yellow fever is conveniently answerable for the failure of the penal settlement at Guiana, and it is proposed to transfer the convicts to Algeria. For this purpose a very hopeful account is given of the resources and progress of that colony.
It is not without reason that the EMranon congratulates the Legislative Body on their co-operation since his accession to the Throne. During a brief period, marked with many and great trials, France has risen alike in material prosperity and national glory. War, famine, pestilence, floods, and fluctuations in tradce stiUl more dangerous, have assailed the empire in turn, taking it successively by surprise and compelling fresh measures. Meanwhile, a new metropolis has sprung up in the heart of the old one; trade has received a vast expansion; France has won more of that glory she so dearly loves; and, maintaining a dignified and friendly position with all the Powers of Europe, is allied to none so closely as to her nearest and most powerful neighbour. Whence, it may be asked, is aU this ? Ve wiU not question for a moment the right of the EMLPEROR to divine the answer of HEAVEN to the prayers of France. We will say, however, that of sublunary circumstances the most remarkable feature in the relations of France during the last half-dozen years, aftor the Russian war, has been her partnership in the public policy and commercial principles of this country. It is for us to regard only the results and the manifest acts of the nation, not the social discipline and organic processes by which they are determined and done. If it bes, suits the genius of France to see her fine qualities reflected in the career of one man ; if she believes her constant liberty of action secured in the occasional opportunity of a new choice or a fresh sanction; if she finds her temperament too excitable for the moderation of the tribune, and sees more danger in many parties than in one man,-all that is for her to choose, and we have no right to insist that she should not only do what we do, but do it in the same way that 'we do, and be what we are. We are content to differ, and that all the more as we are painfully alive to the evils inherent in our own political system. It is in the generous rivalry of two countries so differently constituted that we see the best chance of their common improvemont.

What is the difference between the solitary con-
I What is the difference between the solitary conl finement to which the King of N1APLs has con-
demned his prisoners of State, and that solitary confinement to which he has condemned himself? In the dungeon of the prisoners there may well be found more suffering of body, but in the Royal dungeon there is assuredly far more anguish of mind. We know what manner of place is Montesarchio, in which PoEBio is confined, with a backing cough, with blindness imminent, and with the fell hand of consumption already busy with the more vital parts of his exhausted frame. There he lies, poor man, with his chains upon him, and the Neapolitan MOXARCH will not lighten thera by a single link. The prison, we are told, is very damp, the vaults are deep, the windows narrow, the cells without ventilation or fresh air. Judges, advocates, writers lie chained near each other, though apart. One of them is motionless from rheumatism, another is struck with paralysis, several are afflicted with consumption; but they wear their chains when dyingthey wear them still when dead. Let thena but utter a word or a groan, and they are summarily cast into thereekingunderground vaults, and chained to the floor. This is but a sorry state of things, and yet it is much to be doubted if the King who keeps his fellow-creatures in such sufferings might not envy the condition of the most suffering among his prisoners. If the reports we receive from Naples be true King FERDLNAD is constantly in terror lest the assassin's knife should catch him unawares. For this reason he avoids the capital city of his dominions; for this reason he refuses to travel by the railway, lest treason should reach him there in some new and startling form. He seeks to secrete himself in his remoter palaces, and to avoid all contact with those upon whom his presence falls like a shadow. Nor can it be said that his apprehensions are destitute of foundation. No one can know as well as himself the dark secrets that lie hid behind that scowling brow and within that unfeeling heart. 'Who could tell so tiuly as King F nRDiAxD himself the fearful extent of the vengeance he has provoked? For a moment, at the review, when the assassin dealt him the stab which was meant to be fatal, he seems to have acted with courage and self-possession. It is, however, one thing to pass with decency through a danger which is at an end almost as soon as it exists, and quite another to spend long nights listening for the stealthy footstep, and staring hard for the shadow of the uplifted hand against the wall. The KIxG is well aware that danger is around him on every side; sometimes a ship, sometimes a powder-magazine blows up near where he is, and no man can say how it came to pass. The ground is mined beneath his feet, and he knows it. In whom can he put his trust? His Swiss Guards may preserve what is called the public tranquillity, but they cannot guard him from the unseen death which is ever present to his mind's eye like the pillar of smoke by day and the pillar of fire by night. He can have no confidence in his own native troops. They inspire him, probably, with more terror than any other class of his subjects. Now it is necessary to put one regiment, and now another under surveillance. They cannot be trusted at all events. Such being the state of things at home, whither can he turn to look for support from abroad? There is not one of the leading nations of Europe which has not addressed to him earnest remonstrances upon his reiterated barbarities. There is not one of them which does not regard his reign as a revival of the worst times of the old Roman Emperors, as far as his power extends.
It is no wonder that it should be so, and we must ever regard it as one of the most afflicting proofs of the fallen condition of Italy that such a power can be supported by the strong arms of a few mercenaries from the Swiss mountains, and by the blackguard Lazzaroni of the capital. Is it that there is something in that impulsive, cringing Southern race -which delights in the union of cruelty and power, although every one in turn may feel the lash of the gaoler upon his own back -the halter of the executioner upon his oVn neck? We gather from the conimunications made by Mr. PETrPE to Lord CLARENDON that he believes the order given to Captain AcuTi, the ex-Coramandant of Procida, to inflict 50 strokes each upon 54 of the prisoners really did emanate from the KXG himself. Conceive an English Sovereign taking delight in apportioning the exact number of stripes rwhich should be inflicted upon any of his enemies who might have fallen into his power. We need not, however, insist upon this part of the case. The atrocities which have been perpetrated on the KING'S behalf in the State prisons of Naples and the Islands are so incredible, so degrading to human nature, that the meanest wretch in the British Islands may, when he lies down to rest, humbly thank his MLizxx that he is not as FERDIAND, King of the Two Sicilies. But, admitting all this, it may be urged in argument, what had we to do with the sufferings of the Neapolitan people? Why should we thrust ourselves into concerns with which we had no direct interest ?-or, having gone so far, why did we not go farther ? The King of NAPLEs has been enabled to treat the two greatest Powers in Europe with contempt, because they uttered threats which they hesitated to carry into execution. We much question if the King of NAPLEs has really had any such feeling as is imputed to him; at any rate, his acts appear to wear a very different complexion. Nothing more abject or fawning can well be conceived than the note which M. CARAFA wrote on the 28th of August, by his master's direction, to do away with the effect of his former petulant communication. The French and English Embassies are gone. By recent advices we are informed that the King of NAPLES has actually adopted measures by which he hopes to get rid of his political prisoners, and procure his own readmission into the comity of nations. So long as the remonstrances of the great Powers were merely remonstrances, we heard nothing even of so extremely modified an act of clemency as the deportation of the State
prisoners from their fetid dungeons to the interior of South America. The greatest Power in Europe cannot sustain political isolation for any considerable time, and how much less a little paltry kingdom like that of the Two Sicilies. We deny, then, that the demonstration involved in the withdrawal of the French and English missions has been unattended with effect. Still less can it be doubted that we had a perfect right to carry interference up to that poiilt. If the King of NAPLXS would continue to administer the internal affairs of his kdngdom in so barbarous a fashion, and his subjects had not the spirit to withdraw their necks from the yoke, at any rate we were not obliged to stop and look on. There can be no reason why an English Minister should be maintained at Naples to listen to the groans from Montesarchio, and to hear the appalling screams of the poor wretches who were receiving the " KnG'S allowance" in Procida. If evil resulted from all this to the stability of King FEDINA-Im's throne he had nobody to blame for it but himself.
The correspondence relating to the affairs of Naples has just been presented to both Houses of ParliainentbytheQuEEzescommand. In these State papers the whole progress of the affair is traced from May 19 of last year, when Lord CLAzEsx?os
first desired Sir W. TEMPLTS to remonstrate with the Neapolitan Government, until the 15th of November, when Prince Cnrmix, the Neapolitan Ambassador in London, received his passports and his conge. It is impossible to read these paperr, without seeing that it was originally the intention of the English Government to push matters to a sharper extremity thani has actually been done. It must be remembered, however, that we were not acting alone in the matter, and are sometimes compeled to accept the drawbacks in return for the advantages of a powerful and honoured alliance. Nor should it be forgotten that, in consequence of the political complications which ensued upon the misunderstandings about the Treaty of Paris, this country and Austria were drawn together far more closely than has been usual for some time past. The consequence was that one of the perils which were most apprehended when these remonstrances were first addressed to the King of NAPLBS passed away. An insurrection in Italy became an impossibility, and therefore the justification for interference in the internal affairs of Naples passed away too. There is, however, one ground for interference which could never crumble beneath our feet-and that is the ground of humanity. We can never regret that the Governments of France and England solemnly marked their disapproval of all those hideous scenes which are enacted in the dungeons of the Neapolitan KtuGo; and the sternest reasoner can scarcely maintain that we are bound to keep an official representative at Naples when his very presence would be construed into a tacit sanction of such atrocities.

In ignorance of the negotiations which are taking
In ignorance of the negotiations which are taking place at home, Anglo-Indian society is speculating on the results of a vigorous war against Persia. We by no means wish to curb the high spirit and the ready intelligence with which the able soldiers and civilians of our Eastern Emapire sustain the honour of England against any foe they meet. On the contrary, we should be sorry to discourage a class of men on whom the country has had good reason to place reliance, and whose services, if employed nearer home, would probably have spared us calamities to which it is needless to refer. But in the present case it is certainly gratifying to think that their anticipations of skilful marches and brilliant victories will not be realized. If the differences with Persia can be satisfactorily settled in Paris or London the public will be willing to dispense with the additional page in the annals of British prowess. The state of things, according to the last advices, was as follows :-Bushire was quietly held by the expeditionary force, which was encamped in the neighbourhood of the wells. The slips had left for India to take on board reinforcements, and it was thought that when the SecondDivision of the army arrived the advance into the interior would commence. This Second Division was being organized in Bombay; Sir JAxEs OurTiA was to take the command in chief, with General STALKEa as commander of the First Division. A strong cavalry force, consisting of the 14th Light Dragoons and the Scinde Horse, would be speedily despatched to the seat of war. In another direction Sir JonN LAwsREcE was conferring with DOST MARiOMED at Cabul. HYDEB KsA- at Candahar, and our ally the Khan of KHIELAT, were making aU ready for facilitating the advance of the English, and aiding in the expulsion of the Persians from Herat. In fact, all the intelligence from the East tells of war, and even hints at permanent occupation.
These speculations will probably be cut short by the news that peace has been concluded between the Plenipotentiary of Persia and the Home Government. Assuming that the SHAHS is willing to yield up Herat, to give guarantees for future noninterference in the politics of Affghanistan, and to satisfy the fastidious honour of the British Mission, we think the country will prefer a pacific solution of the difficulty. Suppose us, then, once more at peace with Persia, FEBIRuK KHA a visitor at St. James's, and some skilful Indian diplomatist accredited to Teheran; what is to follow ? Are we to have a policy in Persia or not? Are we to look on the couintry as some Nepaul or Burmali, or to treat it as an important State, wlhich, from its position, must fill a large place in the economy of our pohitical system ? Now that the public attention has been turned to this subject it will be as well to have a decision at once. WVhat is to be our policy in Persia and Central Asia ? Are we to conquer or confirm, to pull down or to strengthen, the second Mahomedan throne of Asia ? The answer to this question depends on facts which the late contest with Russia and the pending hostilities against the SHAHI seem to have made sufficiently clear. It is acknowledged that we have no interest in pushing our frontier farther to the West. The great square plateau of Affghanistan and Beloochistan can never be anything but the habitation of warlike tribes, who may be made excellent allies, but would most assuredly be very troublesome and very unprofitable subjects. As to the provinces of the Persian Gulf there cannot be two opinions. Thley are, we believe, not wanting in fertility in certain parts, but they are too thinly populated, too neglected, and too much isolated from the rest of the empire to be desirable possessions. We have therefore nothing to gain by conquest from Persia ; on the contrary, it is our plain interest to support the State in its fuU integrity. Consider what the Persian monarchy is. The choicest region under the dominion of the SHAd consists of several fertile and valuable provinces bordering on the Caspian, and subjected almost immediately to the influence of Russia. The true Persia of the present day is made up of Azerbijan, Mazanderan, and the neighbouring provinces. This is the native country of the Royal race and the chief persons of the empire. The ancient Persia to which a British army has access forms now a rude and little regarded dependency. We might advance to the spots where Susa or Persepolis once stood *rithout having struck a blow at the heart of the Persian monarchy. In fact, the country is very unfavourably situated for the extension of British influence by force, while it lies temptingly open to our great rival. Towards the south and east it is guarded by a great barrier of mountain, sand, and barbarism; towards the north all that is rich, valuable, and vital is at the mercy of the invader. The capital would be S00 miles from our base of operations, and divided from it
by mountains aimost impassable, and deserts where I whole divisions might perish from a sudden drought. But Teheran is not 100 miles from the shores of the Caspian, of which Russia has the sole command. The conclusion from these facts is evident. It will not do to dismember Persia, and so give to Russia a pretext for corresponding aggression. We might, indeed, divide Persia with the CZARP, but we should most assuredly get the worse half.
British policy at the Court of Teheran is clear and, we think, easy. Persia has faUen under the influence of the CzAR because she could not help it. No one can believe that the SHAn and his sutbjects can have any real sympathy with the Power whiclh has torn from them some of their finest provinces, and against which the most brilhant genius which has arisen in the country of late years, ABB,ns MIRZA, so gaUantly fought. But what can the unfortunate nation do? WVho has ever extended to them a helping hand? The Turks are 2'nnnis, and hate them ; the Affghana are a set of savages, only bent on marauding. It
would seem that the great European nation whieTi has conquered India and opened China to the world might have sought to counterbalance the predomninance at Teheran of one too powerful empire. But in the past history of British diplomacy in Persia we can see no proof of prudence or sound policy. We have every reason to support the SEAR, to strengthen his authority, and to give asecurity to his dominions; but it seems to have been the practice hitherto to quarrel and sulk and threaten on all occasions, without any thought that by so doing the chains of Russian influence were becoming every day more firmly riveted, as the most powerful neighbour of Persia was made to appear its only sincere ally. It is our interest that this condition of things should cease, and if matters have been brought to a crisis by the war not a little will have been gained. England wishes for no extension of territory towards the north-west, and it is to her manifest advantage that Persia should remain strong and independent, as a neutral ground between the British and Russian empires. The interest of Persia coincides with our own, and the two States have therefore every reason to come to a good understanding. Persia has had hitherto good cause to fear both England and the CzAR, but her fear and hatred of Russia are greater than of Englanda,; ince the Russians are at the gates, while hundr of miles of sea and desert still divide the British standards from the ramparts of the capital. There is no reason why our Government should not by a judicious policy turn the Persians into valuable allies, and if diplomatic skill was ever called for it is in the case of the man or men who are to conduct the affairs of England at the Persian Court for the next few years.

FATAL DUEL AT GENBVA.-MUch excitement has been lately caused at Geneva by the mysterious death of a Colonel Asztalos, who had served in the Eungarian insurrection. His body was found some days since in a wood near

The Journal d.c Gerer nowv throws some light on the affair by the following recital :-" About three weeks ago a quarrel took place while at the whist table between the deceased and a gentleman named L - , a Pole, who carries on the business of a wine mnerchant at Bordeaux, and frequently visits Geneva. Although the cause of the quarrel was very futile, no friendlv arrangement could be come to, notwithstanding that Geueril Klapka used aU his endeavours to effect one, and a hostile meeting was decided on, and took place inthe wood of Veyrier. General Klapka refused to act as second to Colonel Asztalos, but lie went to the ground, in order, if possible, to still bring about a reconciliation. The duel took polace with pistols, and according to the usual rules. Colonel Asztalos fired first and struck his adversary in the hip. The fire was returned, and the Colonel, receiving the ball above the right eye, fell dead on the spot. It had been agreed on between the combatants that if one of them fell it should be made to appear that he had committed suicide, and accordingly the body of the Colonel was placed at the foot of the tr eewbore it was found. The deceased was only 33 years of age, and had highly distinguished himself during the Hungarian insurrection."

Opening Of The French Legislature.
LATEST INTELLIGENCE.
O P E N I N G
OF THE
FRENCH LEGISLATURE.
THE EMPEROR'S SPEECH.
(BY SUBH&UMB AND BRITISH TYLF(RArH.)
'The French Legislative Session was opened yesterdayby the Emperor Napoleon III.
His Majesty spoke as follows:-
"Gentlemen Senators, Gentlemen Deputies,Last year my opening speech concluded with an invocation to Divine Providence. I prayed it to guide our efforts in the path most conformable to the interests of humanity and of civilization.
"That prayer seems to have been heard.
"Peace has been signed, and the difficulties of detail which obstructed the execation of the treaty -of Paris have been fortunately surmounted.
" The dispute between the Kinug of Prussia and the Helvetic Confederation has lost all warlike -character, and has enabled us soon to hope for a favourable solution.
5-The understanding re-established between the tli.ee protecting Powers of Greece henceforth renders unnecesmary the prolongation of the sojourn of English and French troops at the Pirieus.
"If a lamentable misunderstanding has arisen *on the subject of the affairs of Naples, it must still be attributed to that desire which equally animates the Government of Queen Victoria and my own to act everywhere in favour of humanity and of civili-2ation.
" Now that the best understanding prevails between all the great Powers we ought to endeavour seriously to regulate and develope the strength and the riches of the nation at home. We ought to struggle against the evils which a progressive society iS not exempt from.
Civilization, though its object is the moral imyprovement and the material welfare of the majority, advances, it must be admitted, like an army. Its victories are not gained without sacrifices or without victims. Those rapid means which -facilitate communications and open new roads to -commerce shift interests, and throw backwards those countries which are still without them; -those most useful machines which multiply manual labour at first throw men out of work, and for a time leave many hands unoccupied; those mines which send throughout the world an Camount of coin hitherto unknown-that increase of public fortune whlch multiplies consumption tenfold tends to cause a fluctuation and to increase the value of everything; that imperishable source of wealth called 'credit' does wonders, and yet the abuse of speculation involves the rmin of many private individuals. Hence the necessity, without stopping progress, of assisting those who cannot keep up with its accelerated movement.
" Some must be stimulated, others kept in check; we must feed the activity of that panting, anxious, -exacting society which in France expects everything from the Government, and to which, however, it must oppose the limits of the possible and the calculations of common sense.
" To enlighten and to direct, that is our duty. The country is prosperous, it must be admitted, for, despite the war and the famine, the rate of progress has not slackened. The produce of the indirect taxes, which is a certain sign of the public prosperity, 4oxceeded in 1856 by more than 50,000,000f. the amount, already exceptional, of 1855. Since the restoration of the Empire its revenues have in,ereasedof themselves to the amount of 210,000,000f., deducting the new taxes. Nevertheless, there is much suffering among a portion of the people, and as long as Providence does not grant us a good harvest the millions given by private charity and 'by the Government will be but feeble palliatives.
"Let us redouble our efforts to remedy evils which are beyond human foresight.
"Various departments have been afflicted this year by the scourge of inundations.
" Everything leads me to hope that science will nucceed in subduing nature. I make it a point of honour that in France rivers, like revolutions, must -etura to their beds, or that they must not leave them. A cause of anxiety no less serious agitates the public mind. When a crisis takes place there is no sort of false rumour or false doctrine which ignorance or malevolence does not propagate. They even succeeded recently in alarming public industry, as if the Government could desire anything else than its developement and prosperity. It is therefore the duty of good 'citizens to spread everywhere the wise doctrines of political economy, and especially to encourage -those doubting hearts which at the first breath-I will not say of ill-fortune, but at the slightest check in prosperity, sow discouragement and increase uneasiness by their imaginary alarms.
" Considering the many demands of the moment, Ihave resolved to reduce the expenditurewithout interrupting the great works, without compromising what has already been achieved-to diminish certain taxes without inflicting injury to the finances *of the State. -

For the same reason the badget allows a sum of 6,000,000f. to commence an increase in the smaUest salaries of the lesser civil officials, who, in the midst of hard privations, have given a good example of honesty and devotion. We have not forgotten either the appropriation for a Transatlantic line of steamers, the establishnient of which has been so long required. Despite this increase of outlay, I shall propose to you to abolish, from the 1st of January, 1858, the new war tax (d6cine de guterre). This abolition is a sacrifice of 23,000,000f., but in compensation and comiormably to the wish expressed at various times by the Legislative Corps, I shall take into consideration the imposition of a new tax on moveable property.

energetically supporled me during the war; you Fhared my sorrows during the epidemic and the famine; you shared my joy when Heaven granted me a glorious peace and a well-beloved son; your loyal co-operation has allowed me to introduce into France a regime founded on the popular vishes and interests. It was a difficult task to fulfil, and for which real patriotism was required; to accustom the country to new in%titutions, to replace the license of the tribune and the exciting contests which brought about the fall or the rise of Ministries by a free yet calm and serious discussion, wa a signal service rendered to the country and even to liberty, for liberty has not more formidable enemies than the outbursts of passion and the violence of languago. Strong in the support of the great bodies of the State, and in the devotion of the army, strong especially in the support of that peoplevwhich knows that every instant of my life is devoted to it and to its interests, I foresee for our country a future full of hope.

" May God never cease to protect her, and soon may it be said of our epoch what a statesman-an illustrious and national historian-has written of the Consulate,-' Satisfaction reigned everywhere, and whoever did not nourish in his heart the bad passions of party felt happy in the public welfare!'"

PREFERMENT.-The Lord Chancellor has been
PRaFERxsnlT.-The Lord Chancellor has been pleased to appoint the Hon. and Rev. S. Waldegrave to the
alisbury Canonry, vacated by the elevation of the Rev. Dr. Biokersteth to the Bishopric of Ripon. MIr. Waldegrave entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1836, and took a double first-class in 1839. His attainments in mathematics were such that the examiners felt obliged to place him in the first class in that branch by himself. He entered holy orders in 1842, and was ordained to the curacy of St. Ebbe's, in Oxfoid, the Rev. C. Baring (now Bishop of Glocester and Bristol) being the then incumbent. He then succeeded to the incumbency of that parish, 'where his zealous labours among the poor will not easily be forgotteni. By his active energy the net district of the H,,ly Trinttty was formed, and a new church built and endowed, being the first church over erected under the act commonly known as Sir Robert Peel's. In 1839 he had been elected a FeoRow of All Souls' Colege, and in 1845 he took one of the preferments of that body, the rectory of Barford Saint Martin, near Salisbury. He has been named by four successive Vice-Chancellors as select preacher before the University. In 1853 he preached a course of Bampton Lectures, taking for his subect the second advent of our Lord. He with great ability and learsnmg, both from the Holy Scriptures and the Fathers, contested the pro. valent views of what are caUled the Millenar'sn party. An edition of 1,500 copies of those lectires was sold off very rapidly, and in the course of a twtlvemonth the volume was out of print. Mr. Waldegrave's zeal and worth, both as a preacher and a pastor, are well known in the neighbourhood of Salisbury, and his appointment to the vacant canonry will give the greatest satisfaction to all in that neighbourhood. His views are those of a faithful and true Churchman, without any leanings to the Tractarian bedy. It may be added that Mr. WYaldegrave is the second son of admiral the Earl of Waldegrave, C.B., whose eldest SOn, Viscount Chewton, died at the Scutari Hlospital in 1854, from the effects of 19 wounds received from the Russians at the battle of the Alma.-Globe.
THE FAsTEST STEAMING ON RECORD.-The Royal mail steamship Persia, Judkins commander, of the Cunard line, on her last voyage from Now York to Liverpool made the greatest distance in the space of four successive days that has yet been recorded, having during that period steamed 1,722 miles, averaging 14 knots per hour.
THE OUTRAGE AT THE CHATHAmPOSTrOoFsCE.-The Commander-in-Chief ordered a district court-martial to be convened at Chatham garrison for the trial of those soldiers who have been recognized as having been engaged in the outrage at the Chatham post-office and the attack on Mr. Dadd, the postmaster, which took place early on the morning of the 7th inst. Seven soldiers were placed in confinement on suspicion of having been engaged in the outrage, and four of these have been identified - their naines are Dennis Craigen, Tnomas Hannon, William Kreffe, and John Macnamara-all privates belonging to the 87th Royal Irish Fusileers. The proceedings of the court-martial will be resumed at Chatham barracks this morning, under the presidency of Lieutenant-Colonel I. N. PhilMips, of the Provisional Battalion, the members of the court being ealected fro,u the various branches of the service at Chatham.
FORGING A WrLL.-At the Ecclesiastical Court, York, on the 12th inst., before Mr. G. H. Vernon, Chancellor, the case of " Searson v. Rad'ourn" was heard. Mr. Blanshard, for the defendant, applied for the postponement of this cause until after the next York Assizes as several of the witnesses will have then to take their trial on a charge of conspiracy to forge the will of the late Mr. John Jackson, of Stapleford, in the county of Nottingham, the will in dispute in this suit. Mr. Shepherd, sdvocate for the promovent, resisted the application, oni the ground that the defendant in this cause was in possesslon of property which he ought not to be allowed to enjoy any onger. The ChanceUor decided that the cause must be proceeded with. Air. Blanshard then addressed the Court in support of the validity of the will in question. It appeared from his statement that the testator was a bachelor, who died on the 26th of January, 1854, at the age of 70. The promovent is a cousin-german of the deceased, who, being a good deal out of health, made a wiUl on the 24th1 of November, 1853,in which he appointed his housekeeper, Sarah Radhbourn, the defendant in this suit, sole executrix and residuary legatee. The property involved in the cause is valued at 30,0001., the testator having been a man of penurious habits. The evidence in support of the will was, tbatit was made by a person named John Oldershaw, a tenant of the deceased, at the deceased's request. Deceased prepared the paper, &c., and then dictated the wording of the will, which Oldershaw wrote. After the body of the will was completed the deceased read it over, said it was aU right, and afterwards executed it in the presence of two persons named Sills, one of whom kept a beerhouse in the neighbourhood, and who were called in as attesting witnesses, at the request of the deceased who attached a wax seal to the will, and declared, " I deiiver this as my act and deed." Mr. Shepherd, for the plaintiff, alleged that the will was a forgery; that the deceased had said over and over again that he would not make a will
and that he never did so, his objection being, that his father had mado a w ill when he was in perfect health, and that he was never well afterwards. With regard to the motives which induced these parties to lend themselves to this transaction, the learned advocate stated that Oldershaw bad received 8001. for his services, and that an arrangement had been made that he should marry Sarah Radbourn, the woman who was to take al the dec-ased's property, and that the two men Sills had promises of remuneration of various kinds. The Chancellor, in delivering judgment, spoke of the defendant's case as a bad one. It was, he said, as plain a case as ever feU to his lot to decide. He should not enter into any details of the reasons which led iini to pronounce the wiU propounded in this case to be a forgery, which he was bound to do. He unhesitatingly gave judgument that this was a case both of forgery and conspiracy, and condemned the defendant in costs.
CONFESSION OF A MVRDER;ER AT HAIFA.-On Saturday afternoon a middle-aged man, named James S.mith, bytrade ablacksmith, made the followingconfessionofmurderat the Halifax borough police-office:-" I have come to give myself up. Another man and myself killed the governor of Carlisle gaol about 14 years ago by throwing him over the banisters, I have been uneasy in my con-cdence many years, and now I am determined to get rid of it." Police-sergeant Thompson suggested to Smith the propriety of being very careful what he said, as the charge he had laid against himself was one of the gravest cbaracter. After receiving this caution, however. he repeated his statement, and added that he and his accomplice were undergoing two months' incarceration for poaching at Carlisle where the horrible crime was perpetrated. On being examined by Mr. Superintendent Pearson a short time subsequently, Smith seemed inclined to withdraw what he had said or reduce it to a charge brought against him at a pulichouse. But the superintendent locked hias up, that the case might go before the magistrates, and the inquiries afterwards made by the police aeited information which, if it failedtoestablish thecharge, cast great suspicion upon the prisoner. One of the most important facts which have been disclosed is, that Smith told a fellow-workman about a fortnight ago that he purposed writing to his brother at Carlisle, to inform him that he intended returning home if the murder at the gaol bad been furgotten. The prisoner is a native of Carlisle, but he left that neighbourbood about the time at which he fixes the comninission of this crime, and for some years past he has resided in Halifax. The investigation of the case is being vigorously prosecuted by the pohce, and MIr. Superintendent Pearson has communicated with the authorities at Carlisle.
NEW BEER BILL.-Air. Fitzroy, Mr. Hardy, Mr. W. Brown, and Mlr. Headlam have drawn up a bill on the sale of beer and cider. It repeals provisions of acts under which application is made to and grants made by the Excise of hienses for the sale of beer by retail, and enacts that aU licenses for selling beer by retail sball be granted only by the justices in special session. All licenses granted within six months next before the commencement of this act (the lst of Septerober, 1857) will remain in force only tiU the next special session for licensing, but other licenses wiUl be saved. In granting licenses the justices must be guided by the necessities of the population and the supply of liquo-r by publichouses. No debt for beer drunk on the preulises wiiU be recoverable unless sued for within a week, and publicans taking pawns for beer wiU be fined 21. for every pawn. Coffeeshops rnd publicrefre.shment houses kept open at night (between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m,) must be licensed by two justices at petty sessions, and these houses wiU be subject to the supervision and control of the |poKie. Keepers of coffeeshops allowing the use of intoxicatingliquors, or gambling,or the presence of thieves aud prostitutes, will be fined 40s., 51., and 101. for the first, second, and third offence. Drunkards refusing to quit licensed houses on request will be fined 40s., and persons found guzzling beer or liquor at unlawful houses wil forfeit 24)s. for every ofience.

A letter from Naples, dated the 9th inst., announces that the convention concluded between the Neapolitan Government and the Argentine Republic cannot be carried into effect, inasmuch as only six of the political prisoners in confinement have agreed to expatriate themselves, and they are too few to form a colony. The King had appointed a commission, composed of General Afan de Rivera, the Attorney-General Gallotti, Tocca, Attorney-General of the Court of Cassation, the President Jannicone, and the President of the Royal Court of Aquila, to inspect the provinces, and to recommend to the Government what reforms they may consider necessary.
The MonitetLr contains the following article on the isubject of official warnings given to the proprietors of newspapers:-
The decree of February, 1852, in establishing that two judicil convictions of a periodical journal entail its suppression, adds, that the offences or contraventions must have been committed within two years. Some journals have raised the question as to whether the same rule should not by analogy be applied to two administrative warnings, after which suspenslon for two months at most may be pro nounced byaisterfal decree. This aasmilation isnot inthe law, and cannot be admitted in principle. The extreme measure of suppression, which a second conviction within a given interval of time entails by ful right, is in that respect different fror a temporary suspension, which is optionaL Even after two warnings, if the facts do not command a more severe decision, a new warning may again be given, and the Governnent, which uses with great moderation the power conferred on it in matters relating to the press, in the interests of order and public peace, always takes into its very serious consideration the date as well as the nature of the acts which have occ3sioned the previous warnings."

AUSTRIA.

VENNA, FM 13.
The following reason is here given for the prolonged stay of the Emperor and his official advisers at Milan. Some time since it was arranged that the Archduke Ferdinand Max should take the oaths as Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom on or about the 12th inst.; but his Imperial Highness has recently expressed his disinclination to accept so important an office without previously ascertaining the exact extent of the powers with which His Majesty the Emperor proposes to invest him. The Archduke is aware that the rigid system of centralization which has been introduced by the Minister of the Interior is one of the principal causes of the discontent of the Italian subjects of his Imperial brother. At present the inhabitants of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom are in excellent humour, because they can apply directly to their Sovereign for the redress of their grievances; but they will probably speedily relapse into their former suUen disaffection if they are again made so entirely dependent on the Central Government. It is whispered that the youthful Archduke has expressed his conviction that he will not be able to discharge the important duties of Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom to the satisfaction either of His Majesty or of his subjects, unless some important changes are made in the system of government. During the last few years the Minister of the Interior has been intent on centralization, in order to render more complete the unity of the empire, but many experienced statesmen are of opinion that he has overshot the mark, and will, sooner or later, be obliged to leave very many matters of minor impor&ance to the management of the provincial authorities. It is said that more extensive powers are to be given to the future Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom than was originaly intended, and that the sphere of action of the Central Congregations of Venice and Lombardy is to be considerably extended. The advocates of violent measures assert that the Emperor has seriously compromised his dignity by his "excessive condescension;" but persons who have had an opportunity of seeing how the Emperor treats his Italian subjects state that he displays extreme tact, inasmuch as he is friendly with aU and familiar with no one. Vast heaps of petitions, which have been presented to the Emperor during his sojourn in Italy, have been forwarded to this city for examination, and almost all of them bear the signature of the Emperor, which in this coumtry is equivalent to an order to the Minister to whose department the matter treated of belongs to grant (if possible) the request of the petitioner.
The general amnesty for the whole of Austria is likely to be published very shortly, as it is felt that it would be unjust to keep other political offenders in prison now that the Italians are at liberty. The spokesmen of the deputation which a few days since told such plain truths to the Governor-General of Hungary were Counts Cziraky and Wenkheim. I know nothing of the latter, excepting that his family is of German origin. The former is a faithful adherent to the house of Hapsburg, although the purest Magyar blood flows in his veins, and therefore it produced an extremely painful impression on the Archduke to hear from the lips of such a man that the pacification of Hungary would riot be complete until great changes had been made in the system of government. Count Cziraky is said to have remarked, that " enthusiasm" was not to be expected from a people which was not permitted to use its mother-tongue when it had to address the authorities in writing. A couple of years since a Croat noble, who is even more renowned for his loyalty then M. Czirfky, made exactly the same remark to me, and finished his sentence by declaringthat the Minister of the Interior would ruin the empire by his impolitic " ultra-centralization."

Within the last few days the last answers have arrived here from the various Governments to which had been addressed the Prussian circular of the 17th of January, announcing the intention of the Prussian Government to abstain from any military measures against Switzerland in consequence of the liberation of the Neuchatel prisoners, and its willingness to enter into negotiations for the regulation of the future position of that Principahty. The four Powers, parties to the London protocol of 1852, have, in these answers, signified their willingness to open conferences for the settlement of the question, and after much correspondence among the different Governments interested Paris bas been definitively fixed on as the seat of the future conferences. There is nothing settled as yet as to the time when the said conferences shaU be opened. It is agreed, however, that the different States shall be represented there by their resident Ministers. Count Hatzfeldt has at length recovered from his indisposition, and has recently conferred with Count Walewski.
It will, perhaps, prevent a good deal of confusion and misrepresentation in future if the nature of these approaching conferences is distinctly stated at once, Their object is to carry out the undertakin-
which the four great Powers entered into with the King of Prussia in 1852, after recognizing his rights to the sovereignty of Neucbatel-viz, to obtain by diplomatic means the restoration of those rights; and this London protocol of the 8th of May, 1852, will form their point de depart. The late liberation nf the NeuchAtel prisoners restored the status quo as it existed previous to the 3d of September, but will have no further influence on the deliberations. The circumstance of that attempt at a rising having been made, and the possibility of its being repeated, has served to show the necessity of the great Powers fulfilling the obligations of 1852, which will accordingly form the subject of the approaching conferences. Those who expectedthatthese deliberations were to end in a renunciation of the Kingof Prussia's sovereigntyoverNeuoh telwiUfind themselvea mistaken, inasmuch as this is expresly not their object, and it is the King's firm intention not to accede to anything of the kind, if it ever should be proposed.
The trety concerted between England, Prussia, andFrancefor the redemption of the Soundl dues i waa. mAda'e subject of a confereneQ of Whe Powers
intet,,ed in that question, on the 3d inst., at Copenhagen. On this occasion not only the representative of Austria, but also the plenipotentiary of the Ranseatic Towns, acceded to it, in addition to the original members of the conference. The withdrawal of the despatch that the Danish Ministry was about to forward to Vienna and Berlin,refusing to listen to the remonstrances of the German Powers, is understood to have been occasioned by some intimations from Russia of her rulers no longer being disposed to support Denmark in the course of treatment sbhe has observed for a long time past towards the German Duchies. The pamphlet lately published by Baron Blixen Fineck on the subject of Scandinavism has been tbought by most of the foreign Ministers resident in Copenhagen to be of sufficient importance to make it worth while for them to send translations of it to their Governments.
The Grand Duke Michael of Russia will remain till about the close of March at Carlsruhe, and then come hither on his way through to St. Petersburg. In the course of that month, too, the Emperor Alexander will also pass through here on his way to visit his mother, the Empress Dowager, at Nice.

Accounts from St. Petersbury up to the 7th inst. give a very melancholy picture o the continued general distre8s andwant, borderinguponpositivefamine, existing throughout the Grand Dachy of Finland, and which promises to become daily worse, notwithstanding the amounts subscribed in St. Petersburg, Helsingfors, and other places for the alleviation of the existing evil. The Emperor and Empress have subscribed 10,000 silver roubles and 5,000 silver roubles respectively for the purpose; and large supplies from the nilitary magazines in Finland have been placed at the disposal of the poorer classes, at very low prices,to aid them; but this aid is of a temporary character. The population in many parts are pershing of huger and cold. The merchants and other moneyed men have subscribed in the capital about 28,000 roubles; among them Baron Stieogiitz's name is down for 10,000. The authorities are at their wits' ends inFinland to meet the great distress.

TURIN, EXB, 12.
After a long and tedious debate, lasting through some 20 sittings, which it has been impossible to report upon day by day, because the discussions generally became so desultory that the arguments would have had no interest for readers elsewhere, and had very little indeed even for those on the spot, the Chamber of Deputies has at length passed the bill for public instruction by a majority of 75 votes against 55.
In order to understand the measure so passed it is necessary to go back a little in the history of education in this country, and remind your readers that previous to the constitution every department of the State was so thoroughly subservient to clerical influence that, as a matter of course, almost all educational establishments were in the hands of the priesthood. After the proclamation of the constitution the public instruction was reorganized by the law of October 4, 1848, drawn up by the Cavaliere Boncornpagni, then Minister of Public Instruction, and at present Sardinian Minister at the Court of Tuscany. This law was productive of much good, especiaUy as it assisted lay education and broiught ecclesiastical education within its jurisdiction, but it may be said that it was too liberal, as it placed too many shackles on Ministerial action. It created, for example, alongside the Minister two orthree councils that were not only consultative but also deliberative, with a prohibitive power, yet irresponsible. By its enactments, the Minister, who was answerable for everythingconcerning public instruction to Parliament, was obliged on the other hand to submit to the wvl of the " Superior Council " and the " Permanent Commission of the General Council of Public Instruction," who held their power in virtue of the law, and could exercise it even against the wiU of the Aliniqter. The latter, therefore, had all the responsibility without freedom of action. It is evident that differences must often have arisen between the Minister and these councils on the subject of appointments, or discipline, or on the interpretation of the law itself ; and when the disputes became very seriouw there was but one solution, and that was the retirement of the Minister, for the law declared councillors immovable !
This has been the reason that no good or durable improvements in public instruction have been introduced since 1848, and that since that period there have been no less than 15 different Ministers of Public Instruction who have aU recommended strengthening the power of the Minister, but writhout being able to effect anything.
Signor Lanza, the present Minister of Public Instruction, accepted office about two years ago. He is reputed a person of great energy and good sense, and has proved himself an active member of Parliament ever sincelS4S;havingstrongconvictionson the distinction between theoretical and practical liberty, and being thoroughly versed in the principles of constitutionalism, he proposed to remove the evil by the roots. After having done all the good in his power with the existing regulations, especially in separating technical from classical studies, he presented last year to the Senate a biU having for its object to free the responsible Minister from the impediments with which he has been surrounded; and this is the law which, having been approved by the Senate at the end of last session, was one of the first measures brought before the Lower Chamber in this. The discussion has been long because the question of liberty of instruction was constantly raised, and it was the members of the Right who raised it most frequently. The opponents of the bill argued that it leaves too much power in the hands of the Minister who may be in office, and that education, like any other profession, should be unshackled by Government interference. The Radical party used this argument with sincerity perhaps, but the retrogrades must evidently have had ue an iArepensge in supporting liberty in any shape; and when it is remembered that the clergy here in general are reactionary in principles, and that they are much dependent on Rome, and that they possess great wealth and many rich corporations devoted to teaching, and could therefore afford to give instruction cheaper than any private individuals, it will easily be understood why the nmembers of the Right were so loud in demanding complete liberty in education, and spoke 0o touchingly of civilization and progress. It was, in fact, the supremacy of the church, and not freedom of education which was their aim.
But, as the Government is not opposed in nrin-
ciple to any liberty, either in instruction or anything else, so the Minister who introduced the bill endeavoured to meet these objections. In the present state of the country it is quite certain that the Government could not and ought not to consent to an absolute unrestrained freedom; but Signor Launa consented that the principle of liberty should be adopted in an order of the day, providing that it should be applied in different degrees in the special laws on the various branches of instruction-superior, secondary, and primary; and this order of the day was voted on the proposition of a member of the Left and accepted by the Minister. A further spirit of liberty was infused into the bill by its framer after it was before the Chamber of Deputies. Hitherto, any one wishing to open a school was not only obliged to comply with the conditions required by law, i. e.-produce a patent of professorship and a certificats of morality, but he was obliged, also, to obtain the authorization of the Government; and the Minister himself proposed to dispense with the last obligation, so that, in future, those who possess the egal qualifications will have
full right to open an establishment for instruction. The law suppresses taree councils, and only leaves the "Superior C.5uncil," which should co-operate with the Ministev, and which the Minister is bound to consult in ceri cases of jurisdiction, such as the closing of a private school, for example. This council is to be eomposed of 15 members, of whom 10 are ordjixiy, named by the Minister of Public Instructio'., and five extraordinary, named by the faculties eE the University of Tarin, all for the term ol fiye I. s> Diides thisz,Vhq have 4.gqq ayq with
the absurdity of the immo.iity of the professors of secondary instruction, reser' ing the privilege only for the professors of the Univi,'rsity, who are usually men of 30 years of age-before, they receive their appointments; and, as they al e obliged in their studies to treat of subjects that have connexion with politics, it seems natural t.hat they sholdd be protected from the caprice or Jyranny of any Minister.
After having proclaimed the principle of liberty of instruction it became still more necessary to strengthen the power of the Minister. In the Sardinian States official instruction, which at present is the greatest part of general instruction, has much need of reform, which can only be accomplished by the vigorous and liberal hand of a skilful and intelligent Minister.
The law was, perhaps, too long in itself, having 85 clauses or articles, and there were too many discussions of detail-too many amendments and propositions of mtnor arrangements, which were for the most part rejected-and that was also a great cause, probably, not only of the debate, lasting over 20 sittings, but also of the biUl passing by so small a majority as 20 votes.
The general tenour of the laws is that al persons properly qualified, lay or clerical, shall be free to establish schools, but that all schools, whether public or private, shall be subject to the surveillance of the Government in accordance with the special regulations made and provided for such cases. In all public schools the Roman Catholic religion will be the foundation of religious instruction, but children not of that religion wiU be left to the care of their parents. The Minister of Pablic Instruction will direct and promote the increase of public education, but he will only supervise private institutions as to morals, health, the institutions of the State, and public order.

The il success of M. Mirbs in disposing of his loan, and the increasing disfavour with which Spanish securities generally appear to be regarded, induce some persons to think that it wiU at last be deemed expedient, in order to improve the credit of this country, to make an arrangement with respect to the repudiated coupons. When Senor Gonzales Bravo was appointed Mfiiiister to London, and it was seen-as it must also have been foreseen-that his nomination was displeasing, and that the manner of his reception might be doubtful, he would have well liked to take with him a proposition for the settlement of the claims in question. The subject was then brought before the Council of Ministers, but nothing was decided upon, and it seems to have dropped. Senor Bravo lingern here, but whether the hope that something may stiUl be done to smooth his path to St. James's forms one of his motives it is impossible to say. Meanwhile the coupon-holders would be unwise to allow themselves to be deluded by rumours that may get abroad into sanguine hopes of justice being shortly done them. Up to this time aU that there is to go upon is, that the question which, under the Progresistas, was completely shelved, has been revived, and I think I may add that it is still not entirely lost sight of by certain members of the present Government. Between this sort of acknowledgrment of its vitality and its final settlement the distance may be great, and many are the fatal accidents that may intervene. The exit of one or two Ministers from office may make all the difference, and nothing is more uncertain than power in Spain. One thing certain is, that a Government like the present, constitutional merely in name, could settle the question much more easily than one which governed in a more legal manner, and with the co-operation of Chambers freely and fairly elected. It is a fact which does little honour to the Spanish nation, that no question is more generally unpopular than that oftthe coupons. This was sufficiently manifested when, in the Constituent Cortes, the subject was dismissed from consideration almost by acclamation. It might certainly have been brought forward by a better man, and in a better manner ; but, nevertheless, the demonstration was uDmistakeable. At the same time, out of doors the course adopted was generally approved, and the great majority of the press declared the subject properly and finally disposed of. Of course, it is pleasanter to keep money in one's pocket than to expend it in paying one's creditors, so long as no consideration of honour or morality intrudes itself; and, this being the view that seems
enerally adopted here, it is prettysure that no populrly-elected Chambers would ever do anything for the coupon-holders. The present Government has no such trammels. Itnotoriously,andperhapsfortunately for itself, does not care much about that popularity to which Espartero's rule was long entirely indebted for its existence. It might to-morrow, if it chose, by a decree, arrange the
question of the coupons in a manner acceptable to their holders; or it might very possibly get together a Cortes so doclle as to settle the matter in the way it wished; or, again, it might postpone such settlement until an interregnuin of the Cortes; but then arises the question w^hether the same men will still be in power. Spanish Governments are apt to build unduly on longevity, and to expire with their work half done, or often hardly begun.
The Cr6nica, Madrid newspaper, of Sunday, contains a long and interesting letter from Mexico, giving details of grievous outrages committed upon the Spanish residents. The hatred of them that existed in the time of the revoluti3nary war seems to be revived; the old nickname of " Gachupins" is applied to them, and Alvarez, " the Panther of the South," as he is there called, is said to instigate their persecution. According to the correspondence in question, a detachment of the vanguard of his army attacked the haciendas of Chiconcuaque and San Vicente, the property of Spaniards named Bermejillo. Into the firstnamed establishment they were unable to penetrate, owing to the self-devotion of a poor Spaniard, whom they compelled to act as their guide, and who shouted a warning as they approached the building. The Spaniard was riddled with stabs, but the inmates were put upon their guard. " But at daybreak, or soon afterwards," says the letter, " they succeeded in entering San V7icente by surprise, and sacked it completely, murdering Don Nicholas Bermejillo and four of his Spanish servants, among whom was a child 15 years old. In vain did the unfortunate Bernejillo offer as much as 40,000 dollars as a ransom for himself and servants. The offer was tempting, and for a moment the banditti hesitated, but then declared thatthey had orders tokill,and did theirbloody duty, stabbing some, and shooting others. Not satisfied with this bitchery, they continued plundering and searching for Spaniards, and caught a French mechanic and a Spanish lad, who called out that they were not Spaniards, and so saved their lives, the assailants saying that they had no orders to kill others than the Gachupins. A few days afterwards other detachments plundered the haciendas of Chicanaqua and Santa Ines, in Cuantla, murdering the steward and a Spanish servant. Finally, we are assured that the president proprietor of the republic, the chief of the south, the patriarch restorer of the democratic republic, announced from Puente de Ixtla that not a Spaniard is to be left in the tierra caliente, or torrid region of Mexico, and ordered the militarychief of Cuernavacatolevyupon
the Ganchupins a forced loan of $4,000, and, as this sum could not be got together, the Panther threatened to go in person and collect it, and pushed one of his advanced posts up to the very gates of Cuernavaca." The Spaniards are reported as everywhere abandoning their estates and establishmeuts, and flying fromtheir persecutors, and many Mexicans as following their example, to the great detriment of their property, at an important season for various agricultural operations. The Spanish Government is determined to take vigorous measures to avenge these injuries, and intends to fit out a powerful expedition to proceed from Cuba and act upon the ofiensive; but the difficulty is, as usual, want of money. This want, which makes itself felt in many ways, can, it is thought, be got over by no other means than by combinig the Eires loan with an adjustment of the coupon question. M. Mires having proceeded to London, it will probably transpim there, with more certainty than it can here be ascertained, to what extent he is authorized to propose such an arrangement.
There is a story current this afternoon, which is probably merely a canard, but which is evidently, if a fabrication, the work of one well acquainted with the character of the Queen. It is to the effect that the much talked of journey to Andalusia is again upon the tapis; that Her Majesty declared that
everybody had had their prOnvnincamiento, and. that she was determined to have hers, and that to the South she would go. Narvaez is said to have had recourse to the King, over whom he has a hold, to check this suddenl capd,!s outbreak. It
is understood th*t the question of the jouxney anat that of the coup d'Etat are intimately linked. lif the Queen left Mladrid it would be a sign that the Absolutists were in the ascendant, and that the blow would be struck or attempted; her remaining here is a sign that Narvaez prevails.
Vessela of war are to proceed from Spain to Cuba, to form part of the contemplated expedition againat Mlexico.

Another candidate for the seat about to bet declared vacant by the expulsion of James Sadleir has entered the field in the person of Air. Ponsonby Barker, of Kilcooly Abbey. This Lentleman, liker many others of his class, was in past times a Protestant of the Eldon school, and held high office in the Orange institution. His views, however, have since been greatly modified, and, in his address to the electors, he states inter aTEi, that as the grant to.

In all times and seasons Mr. Barker wasjustlyone of the most popular landedc proprietors in the county of Tipperary.
A letter from Clonmel, dated Sunday, states that Mr. Murray has served notices of objection to Mr. Bagwell's competency to be elected, on the ground. that his conducting agent is also sub-sheriff of Tipperary. The objection is grounded on the 1st and. 2d George IV., chap. 58, sec. 3.

The announcement that the budget would make its appearance on Friday, and the anticipated possibility of an increase on the whiskey duty, caused a considerable rush to pay duty on Wednesday and Thursdav, and one house alone in this city pai& down 10,0001. on speculation. Altogether it is believed that the amount received by the Dublix. Customs exceeded some 25,0001. In the country towns the alarm operated to a far greater extent, there having been paid in Cork 41,7391., and in Belfast it is said the sum amounted to a very high figure. From this source there will be a considerable addition to the present quarter's inland revenue.
EINCUMIBERED ESTATES CORT.
The estates of Major-General Henry Dwyer, situated in the county of Tipperary, are brought into the Encumbered Estates Court. The gallant General is the holder of two shares in the Tipperary Bank swindle, and his property is of course as much liable for the responsibilities of that concern as if he were one of the largest shareholders.

As was anticipated, Mr. Murray had not the remotest chance of success. The polling commenced this morning, and at 11 o'clock the numbers stood thus :-Bagwell, 174; Murray, 14. Three hours later MIr. Bagwell's gross majority was 166, Mlr. Murray, hi the meantime, adding but three votes to his own, The contest from the start was but a farce as regarded Mdr. Murray's attempt to defeat his opponent.
At a quarter past 1 o'clock Mr. Charles Aherni entered the court and proposed Mr. Edward Bagwell Purefoy, of Greenfields, in this county, as a fitW and proper person to represent the borough of Clonmel in the Imperial Parliament.
Mr. Thomas O'Shaughnessy seconded the nomination. Mr. Robert Hemphill, conducting agent for Mr. Purefoy, requested his worship to open a poll for him, and gave directions to the deputies asto the voting, and the mayor opened the poll and gave the necessary directions. Councillor Hacket, on behalf of Mir. Mlurray, objected to this proceeding. The state of poll at 3 o'clock was as follows, -Bagwell, 183; Purefoy, 31; Murray, 21.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Willingly conceding to Major Conolly all the advantage he ean derive from his having been described as "Lord Lucan's Brigade-Major " when he was, in fact, the Brigade-Major of the Heavy Brigade, the portion of the cavalry force in the Crimea more immediately under Lord Lucan's couimand, I would observe that the question between him and Colonel Tulloch resolves itself into this,-"Was or was not MajorCono21y aware, at the time that he gave his evidence, that Lord Lucan had animadverted on the want of activity andc resource of the Light Brigade in terms far stronger than Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch had done; and had deemed his animadversions so, well deserved as to collect and publish them deliberately two years after the campaign in order that they might be incorporated into the history of the war ?"
If Major ConoUy had never heard of or seen the order of the 20th of January, 1855, then was his answer to the 19th question an honest and satisfactory one. But I cannot believe, from Major Conolly's official position, that he could have been in ignorance of the existence of that order when her appeared as a witness before the Cbelsea Coninission, nor can it be believed unless he states positively that he was not.
One word on General Scarlett's letter on the same subject. General Scarlett assumes that Lord Lucan issued his order of the 20th of January, 1855, in ignorauce of the actual difficulties under which the cavalry laboured in constructing shelter for their horses. But, had that been the case, Lord Lucan would surely not have been so unjust as to> reproduce an order of that nature, so detrimental to the reputation of the British cavaly, long after the extenuating circumstances of the case must have been explained to him-if there were any such circumstances. Moreover, his little work abounds with orders reproving the cavalry under his charge for every sort of dereliction of duty of which cavalry can be guilty. Ntobody, in fact, has recorded sueh damnatory charges against the British cavalry aa those which are to be found in numerous pages of The Barl of Lutan's GeneraZ Orders aid CJorrespandence.
General Scarlett argues that, because the Engineers ai Aldershott have spent an extraordinary long timne in erecting sbelter for cavalry in that camp, it follows that the cavalry in the Crimea could not have done more than they did in preserving the lives of their horses. Possibly, the General's argument may be a good one; but is it not also possible that the engineers at Aldershott may not have been remarkably prompt rn conception or rapid in execution of the works with which they have been entrusted? I am, Sir, Your obedient servant.

THE REFUGEES IN LONDON.-On Monday last the
TEE REFuGEES u; LoNDON.-On Monday last the burial of the late AL Stanislas Worcel, a Polish exile, lon,, resident in this country, and well known in literary ana political circles, took p lace at Higbgate Cemetery, a great number of refugees following the hearse from the residence in procession, and assembling round the grave. An address was delivered in the presence of 400 or 500 persons by M. Ledru Ilollin, his auditors including hM. blazzini and various eminent refugees from Italy, Germany, Poland, and France. x. RoUin, in the course of his address, said,-"The life of Stanislas Worcell was indeed so sinple, so prudent, so modest, so utterly devoid of all ostentation-in a word. so truly republican, that I, who have knoxvn him 20 vears, only yesterday knew the full measure of his devotedness, the whole extent of his sacrifices. While so many in these times dishonour theruselves fo- riches and for rank-when gold is god and avarice virtue-when society, in its delirious ,whirl, makes one think of t,e ohapter which Machiavel entitles ' Of those who have made themselves princes by their crnues,' it sufficed that Worcell should be born tov show us one of the earth's truly great men. Of an ancient. and noble lineage, the possessor of immense wealth, several tinnes a milionaire, allied to princely families, he cast honours, rank, and fortune into the abyss wherein lies buried his beloved Poland. A ruler of the old world, he made himself, without pretence, a simple citizen of a new world. There is yet more;* he, so tender, so good, so loving, broke, in the holy interest of his cause, the tenderest ties; comrades and children having been, byreason of their rank, proteeted by the hangman of his country and loaded with favours, be repudiated them as polluted br the foul contact. He broke asunder the bonds of kindred' to enter unrestrained the great family of mankind. Honoured be this antique virtue I (Cries of 'Honneusr a liil') This agony of soul and body he endured for 17 Years without flinching-without once falsifying his resolve. A sign, a word, would have sufficed to reposmess him of all; he scoreed to yield. Seventeen years; glorious struggle! His pilgrimage was measured literally day by day, hour by hour, by suffering; alwaya cslIm always serene, alwLys self-possessed, be never oessed to smile at adversity as others smile at gooa for, tune.

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MONB Y-MA PKET and CITY INTELLIGBENC.
Monday Evening.
The English finds opened heavily this morning, and a further decline took place before the termination of business. Consols for money, which left off on Saturday at 93;; to 2-, were first quoted 93i to i. There was no tenaency to revival at any period of the day, and the last transactions were at 93g to A for money and 93f to I for the 5th of March. One reason assigned for the depression consisted in the probabilty of renewed complications on the Neu - chatel question, but the real cause of weakness is believed to be the disposition on the part of the recent speculators for a rise to avail themselves of every opportunity for bringing their accounts into smaler compass. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 93a to i-; New Three per Cents., 936 to 94; India Stock, 219 to 221; India Bonds, 2s. discount to ls. premium; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to a; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. premium.
There was a diminution in the demand for money to-day, both in the discount-market and at the Baak of England.
Foreign securities were inactive, and experienced a decline. In Turkish the transactions in the Six per Cents. for the account were at 95, 941, and 94i. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were negotiated at 101. The general dealings comprisedBraziian Five per Cents., 103 ; Cuba Seven per Cents. (Matanzas and Sabani1la), 101; Greek, 6i; Mexican Three per Cents., 22, 21i, and 22; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for money, 80ki; for the account, 80i and #; Russian Fou-and-aHalf per Cents., 97; the small, 97k; Spanish Three per Cents., 40 ; the New Deferred, 24*; Passive, 5k; Spanish Certifcates, 6k and I; Dutch Twoand-a-Half per Cents., 65; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 98i and i.
The corn-market was heavy this morning at a decline of 2s. for all but the best descriptions.
The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 45c. for money and 68f. 65c. for the end of the month, showing a shght increase of speculative purchases.
A further sum of 10,0001. in gold was withdrawn from the Bank this afternoon to pay for silver purchased on the continent. For some time these purchases have been carried on upon terms which to ordinary houses of business would appear to have involved a loss, and from the state of the silver market to-day it is unlikely they can be continued. The Magdalena, which will be due to-morrow from the West Indies, is expected to bring a considerable quantity received from Her Majesty's ship Trincomalee at Panama ; and in the course of a fortnight another arrival will be due from Mexico. With regard to the supply in the latter case, some renewal of uncertainty has been occasioned by the statement received tid New York that there were rumours of a fresh insurrection at Puebla, which would cause an interruption of the transit from Mexico to Vera Cruz ; but after the recent triumph of the Government forces at that place it seems very unlikely that any new difficulties can have arisen.
The continental exchanges continue with a favourable appearance. This tendency must be partly attributed to shipments of produce from England, such as grain, silk, &c. As regards silk our means of exportation havo just been considerably increased, the total value of the arrivals from China during the past week having been about 600,0001
The accounts of the manufacturing trade of the country for the past week show less dulness at Manchester, and a full business in most other districts. At Birmingham, however, many branches of production are aflected by the extraordinary prices of copper and tin. In the latter there has been a further average advance of 3s. per cwt. The closing of the works of Fox, Henderson, and Co., which at oneperiod gave employmentto 2,0O0persons
will occasion inconvenience; but the demand for hands in other quarters is sufficient to prevent any permanent distress. At Nottingham there has been great activity both in hosiery and lace. For the former the American orders are very large, and the stocks of the latter are very light. In the Yorkshire woollen trade the transactions have likewise been nimerous, and prices are advancing. At Bradford the failure has been announced of Jennings and Hargreaves, stuff merchants, with liabilities for 65,000., and assets which, it is hoped, may realize a dividend of about 13s. 9d.
The commercial accounts by the Overland mail describe a considerable improvement in the importmarket at Bombay, the extent of transactions havng caused a reduction of stocks and a rise in prices. At Calcutta, on the other hand, there has been great inactivity, both in Manchester goods and metals.
The mercantile letters from New York this week are totally devoid of interest, owing to the stoppage of business from the weather. The railway-market had been dull for most descriptions, except lllinois Central and Panama. The former, in consequence solely of English purchases, had advanced 5 and the latter 2 per cent. Among the latest quotations were-Erie, 61i; Reading, 81; New York Central, 91; Dlinois Central, 132k to 133; Illinois Central Bonds, 100; and Panama, 96 to 97. Sales of Chicago, St. Paul, and Fond du Lac Railway bonds, which have been lately offered in London at a high price, appear to have been effected at 70i. The ad-
ices regarding cotton have caused another upward movement in the Liverpool market to-day.
A numerous and very respectable meeting of the tea trade, comprising importers, brokers, and others, took place at the London Tavern to-day, Mr. Moffatt, M.P., presiding, to protest against the proposed alteration of the duty as recommended in the budget of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Friday. The whole of the speakers, including Mr. Gillman, Mr. Alderman Sidney, Mr. Lowcock, Mr. Twining, &c., urged that the modified change was altogether irreconcileable with the understanding which prevailed between the Government and the trade, supported by the evidence of communiications with the Customs and other fiscal authorities. It was contended that the present mode of tampering with duties is dangerous, and will produce great inconvenience and loss, particularly when defined regulations under act of Parliament are supposed to guide merchants and traders in their operations. The contemplated trifling reduction, compared with that which should in reaity take place, was characterized as a breach of public faith; and, the feeling against it being unanimous, resolutions were passed appointing a committee to represent the meeting, and to request from the Government a different arrangement. A deputation, it was understood, would wait upon Sir G. C. Lewis in the course of the afternoon.
A meeting of the creditors of Mr. G. B. Rocca. who failed on the 31st of December, took place today, Mr. E. Cohen presiding, when the following statement was submitted by Mr. J. E. Coleman, the accountant:-

With reference to the accounts it waa stated that, although the suspension occurr&1 at the close of the year, it has been considered requisite to make them up to the more advanced date, as it includes those since received from abroad. The assets, the greater pars of which can be speedilyrealized, will, it is
believed, produce a dividend of 4s. 6d. in the pound, one-half of which may be paid in the course of a month. A point that attracted attention was the heavy expenditure of Mr. Rocca during the 11 Years he was in business. The total amounted to about 15,0001., of which 7,0001. was on his personal account. After some discussion it was agreed that the estate should be wound up under inspection, the gentlemen appointed to act being furnished with further information as to the private outlay. Subjoined are the resolutions passed:-
* At a meeting of the creditors of Mr. Giovanni Battista Rocca, held at No. 23, Throgmorton-street, in the city of London, on Monday, tie 16th day of February, 1857,Mr. E. Cohen in the chair,-
' IMr. Coleman, the accountant, produced and read to the mneeting a statement of the liabilities and assets,-It was resolved-Tbat itis the opirion of the meeting that the affair. of the house should be liquidated under inspectorship, and that the following gentlemen be the inspectors :-Mr.E. Cohen, MIr. Charles Pietroni and Mr. J. Lieville* that a proper deed of inspectorship be prepared under the approval of the inspectors, and be executed by or on behalf of each creditor as soon as prepared, of which due notice shall be given; that such deed shall contain a covenant by Mr. Rocca to devote his time and attention, under the direction of the inspectors, for so long as they shall deem necessary to liquidate the affairs of the house according to the rules of administration adopted in bankruptcy as if bankruptey had taken p lace this day, and covenants by the creditors not to sue, which shall operate as a release upon the inspectors certifying tat the liquridation has proceeded sufiiciently, and upon Mwr. Rocca exrecuting an assignment of any remaining assets to trulstees for distribution among the creditors; tnat such deed shallbe a deed of aragement within the meaning of the 224th secGion of the Bankrupt Lav Consolidation Act, 1849, and the 228th secton shall be applicable thereto."
In the general business of the port of London drinig the past week there has been increased activity, the importations of tea being unusuaUy large. The total of ships reported inward was 128, being 38 more than in the previous week. These included 13 with cargoes of corn, 11 with cargoes of sugar, and 9 with cargoes of tea, the latter comprising ]01,411 packages, in addition to 5,867 bales of silk, also from China. The number of vessels cleared outward was 110, showing an increase of 22, including 14 in ballast. The total number of ships on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 68. Of these 9 are for Adelaide, 4 for Geelong, 4 for Hobart Town, 2 for Launceston, 4 for Melbourne, 5 for NTew Zealand, 1 for Port Phillip, 17 for Sydney, I for Swran River, and 1 for Welhington.
The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised nine vessels-three for Sydney, two for Port Phillip, one for Adelaide, one for Launceston, one for Auckland, and one for Portland Bay-with an aggregate capacity of 5,733 tons. The rates of freight exhibit a further tendency to decline.
The Royal mail steamer La Plata, which leaves for the West Indies to-morrow, will take out 6,2001. in silver.
At a half-yearly meeting of the Berlin Waterworks Company, held to-day, Mr. Gosschen presiding, the report was unanimously adopted. The rent for water supplied to 339 houses, or about 3,000 families, during the nine months the works have been in operation, has been 4,0001., and the applications are greatly increasing. A discussion ensued on a proposal for increasing the capital, w,vhich it was explained is required for settling an account of 15,0001. due to the contractors, and promoting the general supply of water to the inhabitants consequent upon an expected extension of the concession from 25 to 50 years. At the close a resolution was passed, authorizing the creation of 12,000 new shares of 101. each to be issued rateably among the present proprietors at 51. per share. The number of directors has been increased from seven to nine, Baron V. Von Magnus and Mr. F. Gelpeke, bankers of Berlin, being added to the board.
Accounts from Sydney to the 18th of November have been received vid Madras and the overland mail. The Maid of Judahwas to sail on the 28th of November, and the Vocalist on the Ist of December. Both will probably bring gold. Trade is represented as exceedingly dull, and the prices of all imports had experienced a further decline, owing to the excessive quantity of goods arriving daily.
Advices from Adelaide, South Australia, to the 26th of November state that the Legislative Council had met under the new Constitution, and that the Governor had delivered his address. A fire at the stores of Messrs. Solomon and Co., Hindley-street, had destroyed a large amount of property. Further researches for a goldfield in the north are stated to have proved unsatisfactory. The harvest had commenced with favourable prospects, and, although the export of flour continued, the price was steadily declining. The latest quotation of Burra Burra shares was 119, and the value of money ranged from 10 to 12j per cent. The Alma, the first wool ship of the season, was to leave in four or five days.

With regard to the general state of the trade Messrs. Colchester and Woolner rermark :---" The tallow-market bas been steady throughout the week; the only alteration we have to note is a better demand for delivery in the lat three montbs, a large business having beeix done from 54s. up to 54s. lid, for that period. The price having advanced at St. Petersburg to 160 roubles, at which price 1,600 casks were taken for August delivery, has been the cause of the improvement here. For delivery next month there are still buyers, with hut very little offering, the bulk of y. C. tallow being in few hands, and many open contracts are stil
unfullfilled. To-day the market is quilet ; 68s. offened for Y. C. on the spot and for delivery in March ; April to June is dull at 57s.; October to December, 54s. 6d. On the s

INDIGO (Fifth Day).-The second-hand indigo in the B catalogue was passed to-day. It contained 1,720 chetst and met with very little attention, I12 chests only having been sold, the remainder having been either withdrawn or bought in.

WIMBLEDoNT A WTn PPnVTn
:Iie adjourned meeting of this company was held at the offices, Parliament-street, on Friday, to consider the pro. riety of sanctioning the proposed Iease of the line to the Lonedon, Brighton, aLid ~Outh Coast R-ailway Company; Mr. W. Reed in the chair.
A copY of the proposed lease having been submitted to the nileeting, resolutions were passed approving the same, and giving the sanction of the Meeting thereto ; at the sIame tiMe AUthorizinq the directors (prov-ided the rent agreed upon be maintined) to make any subsidiary stipulations, agreements, and arrangements with the Brighton Company as to them may seem expedient.
The meeting then separated.
NORTHERN COUNTIES UNION.
The report of the directors of this company stated that the Bedile and Loyburn Compary had intimated their readiness to negotiate an agreement for the amalgamation of the two companies, A committee had been appointed to settle, if possible, the terms of an arrangement for that purpose, but in the event of no arrangement being concluded with the Bedale Company within three months from the date of the report it was the intention of the board to reeume the payment of interest as from the 1st of July, 15 o at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, to ab shareholders w hi
Thad CLnpthefnUl imonnt of calls made on thom. The Lcmprvy 1,00 &-Company not having paid the 6,000C. due to the Northern Counties Union Company, a bill had been filed in Chancer. against them to compel payment.
CORK AND BANDON.
Tenge half-yearcly metrfing w oftiscmpnywas h eold rone Wedesdayf eatly ublien, nr. V. 'BrienP O'Connor in the The Secretary read the report, an abstract of which has
BaneandSl berein movi the adoption of the report stated that the Postmaater-General had agreed to pay the company 1,000e a-year for the conveyance of the mait from Cork to Ban don and Skibbereen. They would ths et rid of the mail coach opposition and obtain the passenger and parcel traffic, whi, ite was hoped, aould more
an pay the expense of conveying the mails from Bandon to Bantry and Skibbereen over the common road. The former engineer to the company had brought an action against
advisable to resist the cllaim. Their ethey Onsion il hd i passed standing orders, but they were threatened with op poeition from some of the districts through which the line .was itended to pass on the ground of an aulled breach of faith with them, as the former directors had greed to make a branch railway to their towns on a gnarantee of 3 per cent. on 5,0001. per mile, which It was found impossible to carry out. He had been recently over the line, and could assure them that the permanent way and working stock were in excellent condition, and all they wanted was more traffic to make the line remunerative.
Mr. GRE. seconded the motion. He understood that Mr. M'Mahon, an original shareholder, was under the impression that the dividend on the first and second preference shares ought not to be (aid so long sas they had a mortgago or debenture debt, and that any surplus that occurred after pAying working expenns and interest on leans should go towards paying of the debenture debt.
The Cn IVSrt.? said, that a few other shareholders con. curred with Mr. M'Mahon in that opinion, but there was no doubt that the board were bound to pay the dividend on the
reference shares out of the surplus. The preference shareholders had subscribed their money to pay the debts of the company, and the holders of the No. 2 preference shares had subscribed about 27,001. for that purpDos. About 4,0001 or 5,0001. would now clear off the debts of the comDany.
Resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring the dividends therein recommended oni the preference shares, and re-electing the retring directors and auditors.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman.

The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Saturday at Hull; Mr. J. R FPease in t Virhe l a.

Resolutions were passed adopting the report, declaring the dividends recommended therein, re-electing the retiring directors, and appointing Mr. Backton an auditor in the room of Mr. Dighby, who had been elected by the board to fill a vacancy in the direction.
A vote of thanks to the chairman and directors coneluded the proceedings.

The base of it, as both your correspondents suggest, is strychnine ; but it is, I believe, coloured with a black sWiphuret of antimony.

GROSS CRUELTY.-William Moore, a journey-
GEoss CRUELTY.-Wiliam Moore, a journeyman Of about 19 or 20 years of age, lately in the em~Ioyentof HnrySyddall, a master swee r ei
di~gat Cestrfield, was charged on S.turdaye: last ath. Municipal-hall in that borough, before Mr. J. G. Cotting. ham and Mr. Godfrey Reathcote, with having on the 12th of January last beaten and craelly maltreated George Briggs, a climbing boy under 12 years of age. According to the evidence of Annm Nuttall, a domestic servant, and Miss Ainn Parker, both residing with Mrs. 1laslehurst, of Ringwood, inthe parish of Staveley, it appeared that on the dayin question the defendant, accompanied by the boy, came to Mrs. Haslehurst's to sweep the chimneys of her house. The boy tried to ascend an old-fashioned chimney, and found he could not climb it on account of its being too large for him to reach across it with his feet, so as to obtain a leverage with his back against the opposite side whereby to ascend. The defendant, on hearing this, began to swear at hin, and then followed him into the chimney, where he bet himn in a most orael and savage manner, striking him over the head and on the toes with a handbrush, which was broken by the forco used. The servant girl, on hearing the poor boy's cries, went and fetched her mistress, who remonstrated with the unfeeling fellow, and told him she should not give him any extra money for himself, which she had been accustomed to do, on account of his inhuman conduct. Defendant again swore at the boy, and told her " She might go to h- for what he cared-he would thrash him again." The child was unable to walk- and his head and toes were covered with lumps and bruises. Mrs. Ann Wilkinson, wife of Mr. Wilkinson, wood steward to the Staveley estates, belonging to the Duke of Devonshire deposed that the defendant and the boy, on the same day: came to her residence and inquired if she had any chimneys that wanted sweeping. She was much struck with the poor boy's wretched appearance, seeing that he could scarcely stand, and his toes were bleeding. She asked defendant, 'What in the world is amiss with that child ? Is bh iU e" He replied, "that he was a very stupid lad, and he had beaten him." The boy began to cry bitterly, and she gave hitu something to eat, but he appeared too iU to eat it. Observing the defendant with a broken brush in bis hand, she inquired if it had been used in beating the lUttle fellow. Defenidant replied, he had only thrown it at him, and in ao doing it had been broken. She then went aud infornmed her husband of what had taken place; he questioned the defendant and the boy on the matter, and nnding that he had been to Mrs. Haslehurst's, he went to her and inquired about it. Finding the child's statement correct in every rspect, he told the defendant he should take care that the Case wasbrought before the magistrAtes, considering it his duty to do so, to put a stop to such inhumanity. The complainant, a poor sickly. diminutive lad, scarcely able to look on to the magistrates' table, though, according to his mother's statement, nearly 12 years of age, was in court, and the bench appeared to be so struck with his childlike appearanco that they asked if that was the comnplaidant? Mr. Cottingham characterized it as one of the worat cases of ahameful cruelty that had ever comne before him, and said tho bench could onlr' mark their disapprobation of such treatment by committmg the master to prison for a term which they hoped Would soften down his brutal disposition, ana at its expirationrender him more humano. Six maonths' imprisonment with hard labour would not be a day too much for him, but inthe hope, how. ever, that prison discipline might have a altury effect on him, they would commit him for three months, with hard lahour-a decision whichseemed to give groat satifactio to all who heard the chargo.

NEWCASTLE, FMa. 14.
There have been large arrivals of wheat, and the weather having I een soft and mild, and umfavonrable to the oonditon of grain, the trade has boeu dul at about former rates.
At to-day's market there was a liberal bhow of wheat from the growers, and business was dull at last weersk currendes. Foreogn and south country qualities were in fair demand, and supported the prices of this day seonnight. Purchasers ot flour bought sparingly at lasI week's rates. Yfalting barley somenwhat scarce anud prioss flrm. Oats. beans, and pea easier to purchase.
PRESTON, PEn, 14.
At this market there was only a moderate supply of English wheat which was pretty well bought up at last week's rates. Irish sorts abundant, and for aU but the best samples prices recded 2d. to 3d. per busbel. Beans unaltered. Oats ld. per bushel lower. Oatmea 61. per load cheaper.
The cattle trade here has ruled brisk, and both beef and mutton bave obtained advanced rates. Beef, Sid. to 7d, per lb. ; mutton, 65d. to 8id. veal, lid. to 75d.; calves scarce and dear.
RETFORD, Pcs. 14.
There was a good supply of wheat at this market, but a very Ian guid domand, and although prices are nominally unaltered, none but the best samples could be disposed of, except at a reduction.

HOPE V. HOPE.
This was an appeal from a decision of the Master of the ROls overruling a demurrer. The bill is filed by Madarao Emilie Melanie Mathilde Hope by her next friend against Mr. Adrian John Hope, her husband, praying the specific performance of an agreement. The bill states that the lady is a native of France, and was married to Mr. Hope, an'Englishman, in England, whence the parties removed to France, and resided on the Quai D'Orsay, in Paris, the husband having become domiciled in France, and that five children were born. In 1853, in consequence of disputes, they agreed to part, and he sent the children to England, but in May the two younger, Adrian Blias and Jean 3"T&U, were bronght back and given into her custody until t'e latter was again delivered over to the father. In August the wife commenced proceedings in England for a divorce for cruelty and adultery, and he put in a responsive allegation. Proceedings were in November taken in Chancery for the delivery up of the children, and certain orders were made, and an appeal presented to the House of Lords, but subsequently abandoned on the signing of the agreement. The lady obtained a decree of the Court of First Instance in Paris for the delivery of the children to the husband, from which the lady appealed, but before it was heard the hueband proposed an agreement, a nd the appeal was abandoned. The bill then set out the heads of the agreement, which were aftervsards reduced to form and written in French, and, as translated, were as follows:
" 1. M. Hope wil immediately deUver up to Mr. Hope Mr. Adrian EDas Hope; r. Jean Henry Hope wil remain under the care of his mother. 2I.M Hlope will abandoa her suit for a divorce instituted against Mr. Hope in rhoEnglish courts, and forthat purpose sbe binds herself to sign without delay all such deeds aud documents as may be required. 3. Mrs Hlope undertakes not to oppose the suit for a divorce instituted against her by MIr. Hope In the English courts, but, on the contrary, to facilitate the obtaining of Euch divorce. It is weU understood that Mrs. Hope shall he able to see her ehildren, to erite to them, and to receive letters from thenm. 4. Mr. Hope agrees to pay in France to Mrs. Hope the annual sum of 75.00Sf.. in accordauce with the decision of the Ecclesiastical Court, to be paid quarterly and in advance. 5. Mr. Hope undertakes to pay, first, the exponses incurred in England for Mrs. Hope: and, secondly. Mrs. Hope's debts in Prance, but on condition that such debts shal not exceed the sum of 60.OOOf. Tbesepayments to bemnade by the handiof Mfr. Hfope's agent. 6. Wvish regard to any accounts that may bo nosettued between M^r. and Mrrs. Hlope, as wveil as the handing over to Mrse. Hope of any articles thst maybeloog to her thepar-tiesagree to leave the matter to be sfettled by Mesrs. Pailet and flovergier, wvhose decision shall be
The bill proceeded to say that Mrs. Hope strictly performed her part of the agreement, withdrew her appeal to the Imperial Court in Paris, and took no further steps in the Ecolesiastical Court in England, and delivered Adrian Elias Hope to her husband. She also withdrew her appeal to the louse of Lords. Mr. Hope, however, has not permitted her, excepting upon one occasion, to see her children, and has not paid any part of the allowance of 75,OO0f., nor paid any part of her debts or expenses; and she further gays "that her husband residesm London, and, by his refusal to perform the agreement, she is left in a state of destitution, and that, if a suit could be instituted by her in France, the Court there would, under the circunstances, order the Allowance to be paid." Sle asserts that it was the intention of both parties that the agreement should be binding both in England and France. The bill, as before stated, prayed a specific performance of the agreement. The Master of the Rolls overruled a demurrer, considering the point too important to be so decided, and, on appeal to the Lords Justices on the 16th of July, 1856, gave leave to amend the bill; and that having been done a demurrer was put in, and brought on before this court; and hence the present appeal.
Mr. R. PAL31ER, Mr. AlmPHuLrT, and Mr. KE?ShYOIZ appeared in support of the demurrer, and argued that the contract was one to be interpreted here and according to the law of England, by which law, in aU cases of a separation between husband and wife, the intervention of a trustee was necessary, the covenant of whom with the husband to bear him harmless from the debts of the wife alone raised a sufficient consideration for the contract. Beyond this it was impossible for a man to make a contract with his wife. The contract was in itself illegal, for the parties agreed to do aU in their power to " failitate a divorce," which could mean nothing less than to obtain a decree by coUusion. Moreovcr, the Court would never decree the erformance of an agreement, the whole of which it woud not enforce. If the view of the plaintiff was correct, and her claim was for money to be paid, she had a right in a court of law to enforce it, and should not have come into equity.
The ATToR.y-GENERAL, for the plaintiff, said that the allegations in the bil, grave and serious as those allegations were, were by the fact of the demurrer admitted to be true, and thus Mr. Hope admitted that his wife had given up her proceedings in Paris and London, and had dulv and faithfully handed over the children to their father, or at any rate all but one child, and yet she had received no benefit from her compliance with the terms of the agreement. She had, therefore, been,-and no milder term was at all appropriate to the cawe-she had been cheated out of her children cheated out of her suit for divorce, cheated out of her appeal to the House of Lords, and last of all cheated out of the money which her husband contracted to pay her. Nothing seemed to be a sufficient inducement to Mr. Hope to pay the 2,0001. a-year waich he had solemnly contracted to pay. Allthings could be done but to part with the money, and this unhappy lady was left, as she stated in her bill, and which statement had by the demurrer been admutted by her husband to be true, in a state of destitution.
Lord Justice K1;IGHT BBUCE.-I should have thought that such a thing as money would not have been permitted to have any place in such a case.
The ATToRNEY-GENTERAL argued that the contract was one capable of being enforced in this country, and cited a variety of authorities from the Digest, and from early reports, in support of that view ; and that, so far from a husband and wife not being Able to contract, this Court had, in various cases where those relatives were parties litigant, held that they could contract to put an end to the litiation. " Angier v. Angier," " Guth v. Guth," " St. £ohn v. St. John," " Westmeath v. Westmeath," and other authorities, supported this view; and the intervention of a trustee was wholly unnecessary. To say that husband and wife could not contract was a fallacy, for in every case of a deed ot separation the husband and wife did expressly contract with each other, and the trustee only intervened to covenant with the husband to indemnify him from the wife's debts, and this covenant was only inserted to raise a valuable consideration to support the deed. An objection had been raised to the performance of the agreement, that there were some parts of it which, if not done, the Court could not compel to be performed. The answer to that was that such parts of the agreement had been voluntarily performed by the lady, and that was held to be sufficient in " Lumley v. Wagner." But It was to be observed that, beyond the fact of the contract being English, it would be enough to consider it a French contract, so far as the payment of the money was concerned, for the money was to be paid in France, and this a court of that country would enforce.
Mr. TERRELL followed on the same side, and contended that all the executory part of the contract could, upon the authorities, be enforced in England; that, although a contract could not be entered into simpliciter, yet under the circumstances of this case, and seeing the subject matter of it, the ease was wholly different. " Iewetson v. Negus" decided that a man could purohase his wife's estate and settle upon her and himself; and other cases showed that husband and wife could indirectly contract together, and this Court would enforce such contracts. Under all the circumstances, the Court would call upon Mr. Hope to perform his art of the agreement, his wife having faithfully done all sne had contracted to do.
Lord Justice KNIG}IT BRUCE said that their Lordships were of opinion that if the contract was to be interpreted b EDglish law the Court could not act upon it. The question was whether the French law had been sufficiently alleged on the bill, and on that the reply would be heard.
Mr. ROUNDELL PALINIER was heard in reply on this point, contending that nearly all the articles of the agreement were to be performed in England, and the stipulation that the money should be paid " in France" was not enough to make it a French contract, and also contended that upon the true construction of the agreement the payment of the 75,000f. was not intended to commence until the divorce decree had been made.
Their LoRDs}ps reserved judgment until Friday week.

THE ATrORNEY-GENMR&L V. CA.LVvRT-. -.T&'.
(Beforc the M_ASTZT OF TIUE RoLS.)
bLs IiONOUR, in giving judgment upon this case, said that the questions raised by the information v;ere of considerable importance, being whether the funds of certain oharities at Hadleigh, in Suffolk, were to be distributed exclusively among members of the church of England, or whether Dissenters of all denominations belongineg to that place might not claim participation in the benefit which such charities extended. In dealing with charities and the distribution of their funds the Court was guided by certain general principles with respect to their original institution. For instance, the Court always respected the expressed intentions of the founders of tho charities, provided such intentions contained no directions contrary to law; and where such intentions were not expressed the Court would countenance any reasonable presumption as to what such intentions most probably were, notwithstanding they were nnexpressed. These principles applied to charities both of a secular and eleemosynary character, with this difference-that in the latter class of charities the Court would allow no principle of law or speculative at4nption to deprive the poor and needy of the benefit of thd' founder's bounty simply becausethe applicant enter. tamed particular religions tenets, unless the founder ex. pressly restricted the compass of his charitable intentions, or specifically excluded persons of any particular persuasions from participation. With respect to the Hadleigh charities, they might be gnerally tested by that established under the will of Archdeacon Pykenham in 1497, and during the reign of Henry VII. By the will in question the archdeacon gave certain property in trustees for the maintenance of 12 a*lshonses at Hadleigh and the sustentation and support of 24 poor persons, who were to inhabit them on the condition that such persons performed certain devotions and complied with specific rules and regulations laid down by the testator as necessary to be observed. it was
,holly immaterial that the testator's will had been male anterior to the Reformation, inasmuch as the real question at issue simply was what were the particular conditions with which candidates for participation in the testator's bounty were bound to comply. The testator said nothing ia his will to restrict his beneficence to members of the church of England as then existing, or since reformed; and, if Dissenters of any denomination could educate their consciences to conform to the conditions imposed by the testator, they had just as much right to claim to he encompassed by the charity as members of the church of England. There must be a decree to this effect -in the particular case of the Pykenham Almshouses, and the principles of such decree must be taken as governing the other charities incluaded in the information,
Mr. R. Palmer, Mr. Selwyn, and Mr. Nalder supported the information; Mr. Follett and Air. Bird contre.

VICE-CHANcUORR' COURTR VfnAN'v P1-
1IN RE15 THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK, EX PABTE WALTON
ANT; TTr'V
(Before Vice-Chancellor Sir P. T. XINDERSLEY.)
Mr. BAILY and Mr. W. MORRIS were heard in continuation of these adjourned summonses on behalf of Mrs. Hue, and argued that where no custom was found waiving a particular form then you must and a special act quoad a particular person; but where a custom and practice was universal it was not necessary to prove a particular case, but the practice rendered the transaction valid, and therefore the transfer of Mrs. flue's shares was valid.
The VICE.-CLANCELLOR said that in all the cases which had been referred to the party (the transferee) had been treated by the company, or its officers, as a shareholder.
Mr. BAILY.-It was essential that the broker should in all respects be able to represent the directors in buying and selling shares, and therefore it mattered little whether the names were given or not. Under the Winding-up Act the Court had power to administer the equities, and therefore in equity the purchaser of these shares must be regarded as a shareholder of them. Under the 7th and 8th Victoria, cap. 113, sec. 23, a party had the power to sell his shares without the consent of any company. Now, here the consent of the court of directors was necessary, and the sale and transfer being one act, and notice having been given of the sale, the sale took place, and therefore it must be assumed that the necessary consent was given. The same form was pursued in almost every case. Saunderson's case was an authority, that a party became a member of a company when he entered into a binding contract to take shares, and that had been done here.
Mr. GLASsE was heard in reply, and caUed Mr. Paddison, the secretary, who was examined as to the mode of conducting transfers, and he spoke to letters having been received from parties wishing to transfer when the transfer was conducted by him and the transfer clerk, and submitted to the board, and the seal was affixed when the transfer was sanctioned, and the respectability of parties was inquired into by the directors from the transfer clerk. The directors had never refused to allow transfers before September, 1856, although where parties were debtors to the bank the right to refuse was spoken of.
Mr. GIFPARD then cross-examined Mr. Paddison, who denied any discussions as to putting a stop to transfers and sales in his presence.
Mr. Gatherer, the transfer clerk, was also examined vivd roce, on the same subject, and deposed that no transfer was ever completed wtithout the consent of the directors,-that is, he would not have his certiSicate. In every case notice was piven tn thAi hnrA
Mr. GIFFARD.-That is enough; we gave notice.
The VICE-CH,ANCELLOR said that it was somewhat unfortunate that here the witnesses contradicted the admission of the parties. His Honour then questioned the witness as to the notice in Walton's case, and Air. Gatherer did not recollect the applications said to have been made.
The case then stood over for the purpose of examining the party making the admissions.

This is a bill by a lessee for the specific performance of an alleged agreement for a lease for 14 years, if the defendant, the handlord, should so long live, of a farm near Salisbury. The agreement was not signed by either the landlord or the tenant, hut the tenant alleged that he had taken possession under it with the handlord's assent, and that the case was therefore taken out of the Statute of Frauds, which requires leases for terms exceeding three years to be in writing, and signed by theparty making them. The case occupied three hours to-day and port ions of Friday and Saturday, and is not yet concluded.

TheVICE-CHANCELLO0. gave judgment in thiscase,which came before the Court upon motion for a new trial at law of an issue directed out of this court for the purpose of ascertaining who was the next of kin of an intestate lunatic whose estate was being administered in chambers. The grounds upon which the motion was founded were that the verdict was against the weight of evidence. The case turned principally upon whether certain parties claiming to be relatives of the intestate, bearing the same name and livin in the same town, thoughin a far inferior station of life, had ever in eftect been acknowledged by the family as members thereof, and it wasin favour of these parties that the verdict had been gven.
Mr. ioft, Mr. Atherton (of the common law bar), and Mr. C. Barber appeared in support of the motion for a new trial; Mr. Daniel, Mr. Manisty (of the common law bar), and Mr. Renshaw opposed the application; Mr. Dickenson also appeared upon themotion.
His HoNoUIR, after commenting upon the evidence with great minuteness, said that he must grant a new trial. Looking at the weight of evidence produced upon the trial in opposition to the verdict, he was unwilling to dispose of the property upon the result of this single trial. His mind was not satisfied with the conclusion arrived at by thejury, especially after the directionof the learnedjudge presiding at the trial, who had laid down with his usual dearness that the evidence in opposition to the claim of the plaintiffs (the parties now applying for a new trial) was hazardous and not to be relied upon. The motion must be grnted, and, as no substantial reason had been alleged for having the venue changed, the trial would take place at Newcastle at the next summer assizes, as being most convenient for several of the witnesses, who were stated to be very aged.

Mr. RoLT and Mr. SPEED moved, under the provisions of the above act (the Joint-Stock Companies Regulation Act of last session), that the name of Mr. Theophilus Faris might be at once inserted upon the company's register as a transferee of certain shares. It was stated that a meeting of the company was to be held this day, of which no notico had been given to the applicant, and that his interests might be prejudiced by the measures to be brought forward at this meeting. No bill had been filed, the application being made summarily under section 25 of the above act.
The company had refused to recognize the applicant or his liabilities, on the ground of non-payment by him of a call the validity of which was disputed.
Mr. Daniel and Mr. Hallett appeared for the company.
It was ultimately arranged that the motion should stand over till to-morrow (this day), and that the position of all parties, under any order which might be made, should be the same as if the order had been made at the time of the application.

Court Of Queen's Bench, Guildhall, Feb. 16.
COURT OF QUEEMlS BENCH. GITrTnITAT.T. 1;VR 1R
SIR THOMAS BERNARD BIRCH. BART.. V. .ITRV
(Sitting at .Wio Prims, before Lord CAmPBE3LL and
Special Juries.)
Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Lush appeared for the plaintiff and Mr. Knowles, Q.C., Mr. M. Smith, Q.C., and Mr. kiurrell for the defendant.
The plaintiff in this action, Sir T. B. Birch, Bar.., was one of the directors of the Liverpool and London Fire and Life Insurance Company, and he sued the defendant, James Jury, an auctioneer and surveyor in the city, to recover d.amages for negligence in valuing certain property upon which the plaintiffs company had advanced the sum of 7,5001.
It appeared from the plaintiff's evidence that in the early part of the year 1851 the defendant applied to the company to advance the sum of 7,5001. to a Mr. Eoward, upon the security of a house and cottages at Manningtree, and also upon some premises at Mistley, on the Stour, near Harwich, consisting of a wharf and granaries, erected in the year 1848. Previous to that time the defendant had been employed by the company to adjust claims for fire insurance in London, and in making the proposal he expressed a wish that he should be allowed to value the premises. This was assented to on the part of the company, a caution being at the same time given that he must be very careful, as the company would rely entirely on his iudg ment. The defendant valued the property, and in h report, dated the 14th of February, 1851, he advised the company that the property was worth 11,0001., and would sell for at least 8,000M, and that the company might safely advance the sum of 7,5001. upon it. That sum was accordingly advanced on the Ist of March, 185L It was a part of the arrangement that Howard, the mortgagor, should insure his life for 4,0001., and should insure the pre. mises to their full amount against loss by fire. The in. terest and premiums were paid down to the 7th of September, 1853, when Howard became bankrut. '.h.,,-
pany tilen took possession, but they could make nothing of the property. hey sold the houses at Mannintree for 4601., but they could not find a purchaser for the Wharf and buildings at Mistley, nor could they find a tenant for them. It appeared that some time before the mortgage was effected the trustees of a Mr. Wharton had advanced the wmn of 3,0001. upon the same property, but as they were unwilling to make any further advance it became necessary to apply elsewhere, and the defendant, who had advanced money to Howard on bills, undertook to get the money from his office. When the money was advanced it 'was in part expended in paying off the former mortgage, and 5251. was paid by Howard to the defendant in taking up two bills whicn the defendant had discounted for himi. Several witnesses, surveyors, were examined to show that the remises, the wharf, and granaries, had been valued by the ufendant far beyond their real value, and that, from the nature and situation of the premises, which Howard had used for a wholesale shellfish business, there was no proba. bility of obtaining a purchaser or tenant for them.
The defence was that there had been no negligence in valuing the premises. The defendant t Ed that he had valued them according to the best opinion he could form at the time; and even now he thought the property would be valuable, provided the Bum of 500i. were expended mlpon it, so as to convert it into a flour mill. The defendant, however, declined to accept an offer made in conrt to take the premises on his own hands. Mr. Howard said he had expended as much as 10,l00L. in erecting the wharf and granaries, and in 1851 he was carrying on a large business there in the fish and coal trade, in which he employed 14 vessels, and from 100 to 200 men. But he had been induced by the Great Northern Railway Company to remove his establishment to Grimsby, for which the company had paid him 5,0001., but he lost 20,0001. by going. This witness stated his belief that the property was still worth what it had cost, provided the premises were converted into a flour
mill, and a tram line was made to connect themn with the 3alway.
Several other witnesses were examined, who stated their belief that in 1851 the property would have sold for 8,OOOL
Lord CumPBELL, i'n summing up the evidence, said the question for the jury was whether the defendant bad exercised reasonable care and skill in making the valuation. If there had been a want of reasonable care and skill, the plaintiff woull be entitled to compensation forthe pecuniary loss which the company whom he represented had thereby suffered.
The jury retired to consider 'heir verdict at about halfpast 3 o'clock, hut at 5 o'clock, when the Court rose, they .d not been' able to como to any agreement. Eventually they found a verdict for the plaintiff- Damages, Is.

Dale and Morgan were brokers, and denied their liability. The <uestion raised was whether a broker buying for an undisclosed principal, but whose name was disclosed before the prompt, could, according to the usage in the oil trade, be held personally liable.
At the rising of the Court the trial was adjourned to this day.

ANDREWS V. HOLE.
Mfr. Sexjeant Shee and Mr. Beasleey were counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. H. James for the defendant.
This was an action for an assault and false imprisonment. It appeared that the plaintiff, a very respectable young woman, had been in the employ of Messrs. Edmonds and Co., bookbinders in Paternoster-row, for 17 years. The defendant was a butcher in Lower Marsh, Westminster. On the evening of the 4th of October the plaintiff, having received 11. 6s. 6d. for her wages, went to the defendant's shop, and was buying some liver, for which she gave the defendant's wife Is. The defendant's wife opened a till, took out ls., and put it in her mouth. The plaintiff said, " If you doubt the shiling I gave you I wiU give you another." The defendant's wife threw down a had shilling. The plaintiff said that was not the one she had given her, as that one was a new one just come from the Bank, and had on it the words " One Shilli." The defendant's wife said the plaintiff was a passer of bad money. The defendant then came in, and said if she did not go about her business he would fetch a policeman. The plaintiff remonstrated, and the defendant called a policeman and gave the plaintiff in charge, and she was taken along a crowded street to the police-office, where the defendant said if the plaintiff would admit that she had given his wife a bad shilling he would let her go. The plaintiff refused to admit this. The inspector said he thought she was a respectable yomug woman, and refused to take the charge, which, however, the defendant did not press. The plaintiff then went home, but was ve unwell for some days, and not able to go to her work. The plaintiff sometimes earned 3l. aweek. The plaintiffwentto amagistrate and asked his advice. He recommended her to go to an attorney, and a letter was sent asking for an apology and a return of the shilling, but no answer was returned.
For the defence it was urged that, although the defendant admitted there was not the slightest imputation against the plaintiff, yet that she had unknowingly passed a bad shilling, and that her abusive language and improper conduct had led to her being given into custody.
The defendant's wife stated that the plaintiff put down a shilling and told her it was a " George shiling." She took it up, bent it, and said, " That is a bad shilling." The plaintiff said, "That is not the shilling I gave you." The witness said it was. She had not put it in the till. A gmentleman came in at the time, and put down a shiling. The plaintiff said, "That is the shilling I gave you ," the gentleman said he had given that shilling. The plaintiff said, " Then it is very much like it." The plaintiff called her a good-for-n othing swindler, and that butchers inl the New-cut kept had money to give in change. She spoke in a very loud voice. A great many people coUected round the door. The defendant came in and told the plaintiff she must not make a noise in his shop, nd if she did not go he must send for a policeman. She said she would have a p- 'liceman sent for. Did not tell the plaintiff that she knew
the shilling was r 'ad one.
The learned Jn-GE summed up the case to the jury. The plaintiff ought to have an indemnity, not only for the inconvenience, but the jury were at liberty to take into consideration the pain and annoyance to her feelings. On the part of the plamtiff it was said there had been great oppression. On the other side there had been no misconduct. From the appearance of both these women no one would spse that the plaintiff had attempted to pass a bad
g, nor would anyone believe that the defendant's wife would have been guilty of that intense wickedness of substituting a bad shilling for a good one. There were many who would do such a thing, but it was generally to be perceived in their countenances.
The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 20s.

COCKnURN an2 &c-i - J
Mr. 3I. Chambers, Q.C., Mr. Coller Q.C., and Mr. Honyman were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant BaUantine and Mr. Hol appeared for the defendant.
This was au action by the indorsee of a bill of exchange for 511., drawn by a Mr. Christmas and accepted by the defendant. The defendant began.
The defence was that the acceptance had been obtained from the defendant by the misrepresentations of Mr. Christmas in respect of the value of a chapel, and that the plaintiff took the bill with notice. The plaintiff is a tea-broker of WVhite Hart-court. Lombard-street, and Cedar-lodge, StockwelL The defendant is an Independent minister, ofticiating at Verulam Chapel, Peckham, of which Mr. Christmas, r clergyman of the Church of England, was formerly proprietor. In December, 1855, the defendant saw an advertisement in The Times for letting this chapel, and, after some negotiations, took it of MIr. Christmas, and accepted the bill in question in the course of the transaction. The defendanfs case was that, although he was only desirous of remunerating himself by the proceeds of the chapel to the extent of 401. per annum, it was not worth this sum; that he had been deceived as to its value and that, instead of the outgoings being 601. per annum only, they were, in fact, 120l.; and that he had made the purchase relying on a written statement of the outgoings and incomings furnished by Mr. Christmas, which was incorrect.
In the course of his examination the plaintiff said that Mr. Christmas told him that if he went to the chapel and preached the Gospel, and not Puseyite rubbish, the people would not leave him; but it seemed that some members of the former congregation had discontinued their attendance.
Mr. Christmas and several witnesses were called in support of the defendant's case, but it broke down; and before the plaintiff's was opened,
The jury found their verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of the bill.
SI5MMoNDs V. TAYLOR.
Mr. Serjeant Byles and M1r. Addison were counsel for the plaintiff, Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Archibald appeared for the defendant.
This was an action brought against the defendant as the publc officer of the London Joint-Stock Bank by the plaintiff, who is a customer of the bank, for money lent and on an account stated. The defendant pleaded payment.
The question raised by the action (involving the construe. tiontobe put on the recent act relating to drauahtsonbankers, 19th and 20th Victoria, cap. 25) was one of great importance to bankers and the public, and was whether where a customer of a bank crosses a cheek, but before presentment the crossing has been fraudulently obliterated by some person, through whom it is presented at the bank, and it is paid over the counter in the ordinary course of business, the loss falls upon the bank or upon the customer.
The facts of the case, in respect of which there was no conflict of evidence, were as follows:-On the 28th of August one of the plaintiff's clerks, who conducted a wine busmess for his master, by his master's directions drew the body of the check in question for 1251., payable to a Mr. Masters. He crossed it with two lines from each extremity, and wrote on it the words " and Co." over the word " London." The plaintiff had banked with the London JointStock Bank 14 or 15 years, and had always used the game form of check and sort of paper as that on which this was written. The forms were supplied to him by the bank, and he had never applied for any other. Thepper was rather thick, of a stone colour, or, as it was sai , dirty-coloured, and uniformly so. It was not glazed. The plaintiff having received the check made out as above bybis clerk signed it, and sent it to Mr. Lyne, his solicitor. The plaintiff had paid crossed checks to Masters before which had been paid through a banker. The solcitor received the check, legibly crossed (he said) in the usual way, wrote a letter, and told his clerk, after copying the letter, to enclose it in an envelope with the check in question, and to be careful that the check was put inside. The clerk did so, and, according to his directions, posted the envelope and contents, addressed to "Mr. Masters, 22, Duke-street, Manchester-square." On the 3d of September Mrs. Long, the landlady at 22, Dukestreet, heard a loud knock at the door, and upon opening it took in the envelope. It was open. The letter seawas there, but there was no check.
Mr. Serjeant BvLEs said it was put under the door, with a grateful acknowledgment,-" The finder is much
Ur.edEMFJUST1CE.-" Quid dominifacient audent cum,5 Woicsfures."
The words, " the finder is much obliged," were written on the envelope when taken in. The check was presented at the bank and paid over the counter in the ordinary course of business. At that time the crossing had been oh terated, and it was only by minute inspection, as by holding up the check before a strong light, that the.traces of the crossing could be discened.
A Mr. Hebden, an engraver, who was called for the plaintiff, said that, in his o inion, paper of the thickness and uniform colour of the checkwas not safe for checks, but the question, being objected to, was withdrawn. Thesamewitness stated that several bankersused such p:aF, but the majority did not. The paper used was generaly thinner, and oxalic acid, applied to coloured paper, would, instead of obliterating ink marks, fix them. On cross-examination the witness said some checks were prepared to resist oxaic acid. He did not know whether this was so prepared or not.
Upon the facts above it was contended, for the plaintiff, that the erasure was equivalent to a forgery, and that in such case the bank was liable; that the constraction to be
put upon the statute was that the words rf the statute
"bears across its face in addition," &c., meant that if a check was crossed at the time of issuing, though the crossing was oblterated before presentment, the bank was bound to pay it only tkrough a ban-er; that the bank was guilty of negligence in paying this check, the crossing of which mighthavebeen discovered by a skilled clerk; that the bank had facilitated the fraud by furnishing to the plaintiff checks upon paper of this description. For the defendant it was contended that there was negligence on the part of the plaintiff in so lightly crossing the check that the fraud was rendered easy; but of this there was no evidence; and that the statute required the crossing to be apparent at the time of presentment to the banker.
The CHIx Jusiio stummed up the case with great care, n said the question of law was one of great interest and importance. It turned upon the construction of the statute.
t was whether the words of the act which made it obligatory upon a banker to pay a crossed check only through a bankker had reference to the time of the drawing of the check, or the time of the preentment at the bank. That question he would reserve for the opinion of the Court. The question of construction was complicated by the charges of negligence which had been raised during the progress of the case. It was a question for the jury whether the plam or defendantthad been guilty of negligence. His
d See no neglgence in the plaintif's conduct. was a daily occurrence to send checks and draughts through the post, and the business of the country could not
o onnunless that vvas done. Then, were the defendants glty of negligence? Did the use of this particular desription of paper invite the forgery? The check had been very ingeniousfly crumpled and folded to prevent the dis-
co ofthe fraud, but it was a question for the jury to sAY whter ever check presented at a banker's was to be scrutinizedeby holding.itus,to the light to see if it was croesed, ashad been sug7gestedl. They were to say whether te bnhad exercised due and reasonable care in paying this cheek, therte being nothing at once visible to the eye on the fatce o ibt at the time when it was presented to show

wur. ZerJeasu Tnomas and Mr. W. Cooper were counEel for the plaintiff ; Mr. Laxton appeared for the defendant.
This was an action of tresass for false imprisonment on a charge of stealing lead. The defendant is a plumber, who, having a job in Bedford-square, employed the plaintiff thereon, with the condition that he should not send his son, who appears to have borne but an indifferent character. The plaintf, however, did employ his son and one Peart, and after afew days the defendant complained to the plaintiffthat the lead had been stripped off the roof of the house adjoining that on which the job was being executed and stolen by his son. The plaintiff said he knew nothing of it, and afterwards the defendant told him Le could settle the matter for his son if he (the plaintiff) would sign a letter for 101. The plaintiff declined to enter into this compromise, and the son was taken up, when Peart was examined as a witness. The result of his evidence was that the magistrate (Mr. Hall) expressed the opinion that there was a case against the plantiff as well as hiS son, and the case was remanded, he clerk saying there must be corroborative evidence adduced, as Peart was an accem plice, when the defendant and the policeman who had charge of the case were discussing the affair. After this they both agreed that the magistrate wasquite right, and they parted with the evident understandin that the plaintiff would be taken into custody, and corroborative evidence produced, but the defendant gave no directions on the subject. In a few days the policeman. feeling himself in a position to proceed, took the plaintiff into custody ashe was about to rise at 5 o'clock inthe mornig, and taking him to the sttionhouse, sent for the defendant, who, having heard that cor-roborativeevidence had been obtained, signed the chargesheet, whereupon the plaintiffvwas taken to Bow-street, and after an imprisonment of one hour committed to the Westminster Sessions. After an interval of three weeks the trial came on, when the son was convicted and the plaintiff ,cquitted, the defendant admitting that he bore an excellent character. Under these circumstances,
Mr. Baron MAITnsT was of opinion that there was no evidence against the defendant on the single plea of "N Not Guilty." it va clear that the policeman had taken the plaintiff into custody on the authority of the magistrate, founded on the oath of Peart, and not bv order of the defendant. The only question was wfiether the fact that the defendant had signed the charge-sheet was evidence to go to the jury. He was of opinion that it was not; but, lest he should be wrong in that, he would take the opinion of the jury whether the defendant had imprisoned the plaintiff, and, if so, they would give damages for an imprisomnent of one hour only, as after the magistrate interfered by commnitting the plaintiff the defendant was not answerable. As to the first question, if the jury thought the defendant had put his name to the charge-sheet as a matter of form, and to carry out the orders of the magistrate they ought to acquit the defend. ant altogether; hut if they thought the defendant meant by that act to take upon himself to prefer the charge and to imprison the plaintiff, then they mught find for the plaintiff.
The jury, after considering, returned a verdict for the plaintif for 51., whereupon
His LOBDssp directed a nonsuit to be entered, subject to a motion to enter a verdict for the plaintiff for 51.
Mr. Serjeant THoMAs afterwards staed that he had agreed with his friend to enter a stf t rocewus if his Lordship entertaned a strong opinion as to the fate of his motion.
Mr. Baron MAmTLT.-I really think that would be a proper end of the case.
It was thereupon agreed that a std procCssus should be entered.
O'DRScOLL V. CASTLEBERG.
Mr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. W. Cooper were counsel for the plaintiff; M-r. Huddleston was counsel for the defendant.
Thiswas also an action for false imprisonment on a charge of felony, with a plea of justification. The plaintiff and the defendant are both watchmakers and dealers, near Wellclose-square, and it appeared that the house of the defendant, who is a Jewish Babbi, of venerable appearance, with a forked beard, had been robbed frequently, and that on the 21st of October last, which was the " joy day" of the Feast of Tabernacles, his shop was broken open while he was engaged in celebrating that service and ceremonial in a private chapel attached to his house, and several watches stolen. In about a fortnight after a German Jew, named Lewis, brought a watch to the defendant, the case of which he said he thought was one of those stolen on the 21st, the works and the case evidently not corresponding. The defendant recognized his mark on the case, and on ascertaining that the plaintiff had given the watch to Lewis to change or sell, the defendant gave him into custody on a Saturday. On the Monday after the case was heard before a magistrate, when the defendant, though he was certain of the identity of the case, dechned to swear to t, and the charge was dismissed. In support of his case the plai tiff was now examined, and, according to his account, he had bought a "ticket" of the watch in question nine months before the 21st of October, and, if so, of course the case could not have been stolen from the defendant on that day. The plaintiff, however, gave a very indifferent account of himself when under cross,bxamination, declining to say whether he had not been convicted four times, or had been imprisoned 18 months for obtaining money by false prtences from two foreigners, while he admitted that he mnght have passed himself offas acaptain inthe army when drunk, hebeing actually a private. UJnder these circumstances the ury gave credit to the evidence adduced by the defendant ina spport of his plea, alleging facts which reasonably justified him in preferring the charge against the plain-
tf, and at once returned a verdict for the defenda nt.

The CnIF Coiiilssiozrxn did not look upon the statemnent as a threat.
Mr. Lyons read a letter from a friend of the insolvent, offering an acceptance after the opposition, if it was withdrawn, as a judgment would be injurious to his future prospects.
The CmiEF COwDuSSIONEU told the creditor that the bill would have been of no value to him.

Mr. ThcnOtS, on the part of Messrs. Howitt, wvas anxious to call one of the partner in consequence of the report which hadappearedin the newspapersthatthey had put in an execution and s-wept away the goods in the insolvent's chambers in the Temple, in breach of an alleged promise not to molest him.
The insolvent reiterated his statement that Mr. Chatfield had told him he would not molest him. He said property worth 901 had been swept away on a debt of 281., off which 8. had been paid.
Ir. Chatfield, one of the partners in the establishment of Messrs. Howitt, was called. He stated that he met the insolvent in October, 1855, and consented to wait till the end of the year, telling hilm that he would give him to the 1st of Janu, and on the 2d he would take him or anything ho had .He had offered to buy in some Bibles at the sale for the insolvent, but another person bought them with the same object. At the ade he purchased the insolvent's likeness, which had been presented to him by some of his former congregation, and also some other pictures, which he offered to han over for the same sum which he bad paid for them. UJpon his refusing to part with them unless tne money were paid attho same time, the insolvent wvrote him a letter, in which, referring to the death of a child whom he ( Cr Chatfield) bad recently lost by ac4ident, he said "God's vengeance would pursue him for persecuting a clergyman."
The insolvent declared that nothing was said about the iles. r. Chatfield had promised not to molest him

might be done. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ yne The insolvent, in his evidence, spoko of his wife having " eloped" from him, onfrhlch her trustee complained, and
he said he did not mean that she had eloped wiith anyone, I bnt she had left him.j
r Simpson said his debt had been incurred when the person before the Court was hopelessly insolvent, and he thought it a case in which an example should be made of a cl ergyman who had pursued such a reckless career.
The CHIEF COAMSSIO.NX, in giving judgment, first dis-
posed of the matter which had brought Mr. Chatfield into I court, ndexpressed himself perfectly satisfied with the statement of that gentleman. Indeed, the insolvent did not contradict him. It was true Mr. Chatfield had promised not to molest him, but he seemed to forget that that would expire on the 1st of January, and not until after that period was the execution levied. His Honour reviewed the general features of the case, and alluded to the number of creditors, and to the debts being incurred in almost every place where the insolvent had resided. The insolvent had held several small curacies which were wretchedly paid, and no wonder that there should be debts when such sums as 501. and 90L. a-year were paid for curates' services; but stil there should h_ve been prudence shown, and a per-
son with such an amount knew he could not pay the debts I he went on increasing. Ifis Honour considered that the debt with Messrs. Davis and Simpson had been incurred without any justification in January, when the insolvent must have known that there were executions against him; and the debt of Mr. Lyons was contracted .so without reasonable expectation of payment. Although the insolvent had been in prison a long time, from February last, and the vesting order was in March, it was necessary to give an effectivejudgment in such a case, and he therefore adjudged himnto be discharged as to all his other creditors; and, as to Messrs. Davis and Simpson, when he had been in prison for 15 calendar months at their suit, and 13 months at the suit of Mr. Lyons, for contracting their debts without reasonable expectation of payment.
The illdgmenb3 are concurrent from the vesting order on the 24t of 3March.

IN BIE SIR HMNRY CHUDLEIGH OXENDEN, BART.
In this case there was no opposition, and the insolvent was ordered to be discharged forthwith.
IN RE A.. 1. B. KIAHAN.
We have received a letter from this insolvent, complaining that in the report of his case on Saturday he was represented as charging the opposingereditorwithhaving "kept" instead of " purloined ' a portion of a literary work. As the insolvent says that he made use of the stronger term we give this correction by his desire, but at the same time must remark that the learned Commissioner does not appear to have considered the charge thereby conveyed to be proved, seeing that he remanded the insolvent for srx months upon the opposing creditor's complaint. With respect to the justice of the decision of the Court, of wrhich the insolvent, not si.naturally, does not approve, and of his future intentions towards the opposing creditor, those are not matters for a newspaper to enter upon.

The sittings of the Court for the Februaay general session were resamed this morning at the Guildhall,Westminster before Mr. Pashley, QWC., Aseistast-Judge, and a bench of magistrates. There were the names of 120 prisoners in the calendar, all of whom, except nine, were charged with felony.
The Court was occupied the whole day In disposing of cases in which the prisoners pleaded guilty, and a few of which were undefended.

Police.
POLICE.
MASIOX-IEOUSE.-Henry Miller was charged with having, together with another person not yet in custody, stolen a cashbox, containing between 601. and 701., the property of the East India Company. Mr. Madle attended for the prosecution.
Mr. Maide said, he regretted to state that the person with whom the prisoner was believed to be concerned in the robbery was the son of the messenger to the secretary to the East India-house.
Samuel Ruggles who was much agitated as he gave his evidence, seid,-I have an office fitted up with railngs and drawers outside the office of the secretary of the East Indiahouse, to whom I am messenger. I had in one of the drawers the cashbox produced, which was locked up on Friday Last. On that day it contained two 10. ;nd seven 51. notes, and gold and silver to the amount of 121. or 131., and was in the drawer on the left side, in the middle of a nest of drawers. About half-past 5 o'clock I left the box safe, locked up in the drawer, and at a-quarter past 10 o'clock on Saty morning I found my drawers shut with the bolts sprung, as if locked from the outside and I then missed my cashbox. I have a son named William, who is 15 years old, and in the service of a gentleman in Sise-lane. He lived in my house and used frequently to come to me at the East India-house, where he would have the opportunity of seeing where I koAt auytlig. He absented himself from my house at Daston a week ago, nd I made inquiaies about him, but Ididnot see him afterwards. I communicated my suspicions tothe secretary. The box was brought to my house on Satu rday last in the envelope p reduced, which bears the handwriting of my son in the address. My dauehter brouehit it to ,on {n 4i, f,.rn, fTl-i4A

I did not krowrshlm. uVe gave me a description of the person from whom he received it, and that descriytion corresponds with that of my brother, whose handwrnting was on the wrapper. The box was open in the wrapper, and the lock was forced. It did not contain any money, but it had some papers in it. The person who brought the box went with me as far as a coffeehouse in Shoreditch.
Funnell (the detective officer).-I received information of the robbery on Saturday between I1 and 12 o'clock, and I went to make inquiries about William Ruggles. I received information that e had been to the Amazon coffeeshop in Nortonfolgate, and found that he had been lodging there about a week, and that the prisoner's mother kept the house. I went from place to place after the prisoner, and at last I found him in a travellDng caravan in Old Nicholstreet, near Shoreditch, with the son of the Proprietor and another. I told the prisoner that I was an officer, and that I took him into custody for being concerned with young Ruggles in stealing a cashbox. He said he knew young Ruggles, but was not aware that he had taken the box. I found 10s. 8d. on the prisoner, who said he had been with Ruggles at half-past I o'clock yesterday. I ascertained, in making my inquiries, that some banknotes had been changed.
The wsitness, in answer to a question from MIr. Mauloe said he believed he should be able to prove that the prisoner htadl assisted in passing the banknotes which had been
The prisoner was then remanded.
The LOiD MAY0oR requested that the press would acknowledge his receipt of L 10s. from the Vintners' Company, through Tr. G. Lomas, the clerk to the company, for the poor-box.

WORSHIFP-sTREBT.-Mr. Thomas Haydon Harrison, a gentleman residing at Enfield, was charged before Mr. B AIlMILL, at the instance of the Eastern Counties Railwy Company, with unlawfully delaying one of their officers in the execution of his duty.
Mr. Barnard appeared for the compauy's officer, and Mr. Lewis, of Ely-place, for the defendant.
llr. George Croxton, the stationmaster at Stratford, stated that on the 9.39 a.m. train, to which there was a smoking-carriage attached arriving at Stratford on the morning of the 10th inst., be went with one of the ticketcollectors to the smokiDg-carriage to collect or see the tickets, and asked the defendant to show his. e said, " Suppose I have lost itr' "Then," said the witness, " you will have to pay the fare." Defendant laughed and on witness again asking him, he replied, *I w, if I can' find it." He then drew from his pocket a number of scraps of paper, like envelopes, and, looking at them one at a time, kept saying, t Is this it? No, that is not it," and so on, and returned thes to his pocket. He then as deliberately took from his coat-tail pocket some pieces of gun-wadding, and, turning them over in his hand, said, " It is not here. he next produced a razor-strop, and, after turning that over and e 4minina it. _;-nV- ..,.*
-No, that is not it." He next took out his penknife and paid the same about that, and then pointed to a m"eerscha
pipe-case-one lying on the smoking-table, and, addreEsin; himself to some of the other passengers, said, "II believe itis in there; will you have the kindness to look ?" This conduct induced remarks from some of the passengers as to the way in which the train was being delayed, and the defendant ultimately took from his breast-pocket, as the witness believed, a season-ticket, and showed it to him, but the result of itwas that the train was delayed about six minutes the usual time taken in collecting the tickets being from a minute and a-half to two or three ninutes, whereas now it was detained ten.
Cross-examined.-When he asked for defendant's ticket all the tickets but one bad been collected; in fact, he had everybody's ticket six minutes before he got the defendant's. He knew the defendant had a season ticket, which did not expire till September 27, and had seen it the day before. What the custom was at Enfield witness did not know, but no one, of course, was required to show his ticket at Bishopsgate, as Stratford was the place for so doing. Formerly season-tickets were allowed to pass without examination, but since the Ist inst. a new regulation had been made rendering that compulsory. (The defendant's ticket was here produced, and at the foot was this express direction "This ticket is to be shown to the officer on duty.")
Mr. Barnard explained that the cause of the alteration in the practice was, that the company had discovered that their season tickets were frequently lent to other persons by the purchasers, and that the company were losers by them to that extent in consequence.
Two other officers of the company also proved that the train was delayed five or six minutes by the defendant's conduct, it being detained from 9.39 till 9.49, whereas it should have left at 9.40.
Mr. Barnard did not care for a conviction or its amount, hut it was imperative to have this principle of showing the ticket established.
Mr. HLUmMLL was quite clear in his opinion that the ticket must be produced, both at any station and every one where it was thought necessary to ask for it. Great delay and inconvenience had undoubtedly been caused by the defendant, who must not be permitted to obstruct the train and annoy his feUow-passengers, and he should therefore order him to pay a penalty of 10s. and Copts.
Mr. Barnard said there were other summonses against otber defendants for similar vexatious conduct, but, as the sole object the company had in view was now obtained, he should not proceed any further with them.
CLE RwENWELL.-The second half of a 51. note has been received from " M.P." for the poor-box of this court. The Post-office order addressed to the sitting magistrate by "- F. M. S." it has been ascertained has been stolen in its transit, and the money obtained. The Post-office authosities have the matter in hand and are making the necessary
inquiries.
Honorah M'Sweeny, alias White, a repulsve-looldn
woman, was placed at the bar before Air. ConsRiE, charged with felonuiously stabbing Edward White, with intent to do him grievous bodily harm, and further with assaulting Abigail White, the wife of the prosecutor.
Mr. Mather, surgeon to the police, said he had examined the wound, which was an inch and a-half above the left breast.1, It was an incised wound and, had the knife not struck one of the ribs, it would iave entered the centre of the heart and caused immediate death.
The prisoner when called upon for her defence denied all knowledge of the facts, and said it was all a mistake.
Mr. CORRiE committed the prisoner to Newgate for trial.
SouTnwARx.-John Henry Goulburn, a well-dressed young man,whose fatherholds ahigh position at Birkenhead, was frought up from Livorpool by Inspector Murphy, and placed in the felons' dock before Mr. BuRC1Am, charged with stealing a number of valuable medical books and a great-coat from the premises of Dr. Steadman, of 171, Union-street, Southlwark.
Mr. Solomon attended for the accused, who stood leaning on the railings of the dook with his face buried in his hands during the examination.
Dr. Stedman said that the prisoner was a medical student, and in the early part of October he took him into his service, the remuneration for which was to be his board and lodging and two hours each other day to enable him to pursue his studies. Having received some information detrimentalto his characterbe gave him notice on the 12th of November to leave on the 22d. However, after breakfast on the 15th the prisoner absconded, and in the evening witness received a letter from him, stating that he had taken the liberty of taking the loan of a few medical books, which he would safely return. Witness had not missed them before he received that note. Directly after that a great coat, belonging to Philip Moore, a pupil was also missed. The books were extremely scarce and valuable. Jn cross-examination by Mr. Solomon witness said he saw the prisoner's father on Saturday night, and, knowing him to hold a high position at the Birkhenhead docks, and that the family were highly respectable, he saidi that he would not prosecute provided he were paid the value of his books and the expenses he had been put to. The father also observed that a public exposure in a court of justice would bring disgrace on the family
Inspector Murphy, of the Liverpool detective police, said be apprehended the prisoner on Saturday, and when he told him what he was charged with he acknowledged taking the books and coat, and that he had disposed of them to defray his expnses from London to his parents, as he had no money. He also said he had sent a note to Dr. Steadman.
Mr. BtRitcirA asked whether he said how he had disposed of the property ?
Witness.-He said that he sold the books in Holborn, and changed away the coat.
Mr. BuRcnAu said that the case had assumed quite a different aspect, and there could be no doubt as to the felony. would the prisoner prefer being tried by him or go to the sessions?
Mfr. Solomon, on his behalf, said it was a very painful case. The father of his client was a gentleman of high position, a magistrate at Birkenhead, and he was instructed to say that his son would not have been placed in that dock had he paid the exorbitant sum of 141. to Dr. Steadman. lie had been in that gentleman's service only three wceks, anid it was the first offence he had committed. He should plead "guilty," and hoped his worship would ta'e the case into his merciful consideration by awarding a small punish-
ment.
Mr. BURCHALM said, it was very pinful indeed to see a person in the prisoner's con&tion of life in such a disgraceful situation. He regretted very much that in the whole case he could see no cause for mitigation of punishment. It appeared from wbat he had heard that he was respectably connected, and if he wanted to leave his situation to go to his friends lie might have essilywritten to them for funds, which he could have had no difficulty in obtaining. Instead of that he laid his hands on his employer's property and a coat. belonging to a pupil staying with him, and feloniously disposed of them. In adminLstering justice in that court he could not take into consideration the position of the parties brought before him. He must look at the nature of the offence and deal out justice to all. The sentence on the prisoner was that he be committed to the House of Correction for four months with hard labour.
Dr. Steadman complained of the statement made by Mr. Solomon, that he offered to compromise the matter for a certain sum of money. He did nothing of the kind. All he did was to consent to withdraw the prosecution ou receiving the value of his books and expenses.
Mir. BUsicisAs told him he need not take any notice of such remarks. He bad acted aU through like a gdntleman.
L.,u1BTH.-Thomas Kerr, a middle-aged man deficient of a nose, was charged before Mr. EL1iOrT with intending to commit suicide by swallowing what he conceived to be poison.
From the evidence it appeared that the prisoner went to the bhop of a chymist to purchase twopennyworth of arsenic, but the shopkeeper, suspecting his object, supplied him with jalap. This he swallowed, but immediately afterwardsrelented, and, exclaiming that be had poisoned himself, he was taken to the hospital, where the stomach-pump was used; but the surgeon in attendance, having discovered the nature of the drug, left sullicient behind to give him a thorough scouring.
Mr. ELLIO1T told the prisoner he richly deserved being sent to the treadmil, hut, as he seemed to have suffered a good deal by his conduethe should di s rge him.

THE DUTY ON TEA.-A public meeting of the
THE Dur-x oX TFA.-A public meetina of the importers and dealers in tea was yesterday held at the London Tavern, to protest against the proposed resolution -of the Ohancellor of the Enchequer, by which a war duty is to be retained upon tea, contrary to the act of Parliament of I155. Mr. Moffatt, M.P., presided and briefly in-
-troduced bhe subject to the notice of the meeting, regretting i that so sudden a summons had been issued to the trade. It was necessary, however, tlhat no time should be lost, as the Chancellor's financial statement came on that evening for discnssion in the House of Commons, and the dealers .and importers required to resolve immediately upon what was necessary to be done. The Government had broken its solemn promise to them and had unsettled the trade in all its relations, but he trusted the representatives of that important branch of national commerce would not ,quietly acquiesce in these steps. (Cheers.) After what had been done no reliance could be placed in t.he promised reduction of next April twelvemonths, for if Government was pressed on the subject of fire insurance or other taxes he did not believe they would hesitate to throw -the matter over again for another year. 1'Jr. Gillman moved the first resoletion, to the effect that that meeting heard with ex rome surprise of the proposition of the Chan.cellor of the Excheqcer, by which the daty was to be continued upon tea, contrary to the pledne involved in the act -of 1855, and upon the faith of which all existing contracts in that important trade had been made; and that they accordingly protested agzinst that breach of faith, as alike .disadvantageous to the interests of the revenue, the trade, and the public. He (Mlr. Gillman) thouglht that the word "surprise" was a very weak one to express the feeling with which the whole trade learnt of the injustice with which it was treated-an injustice to enact which it was necessary to conmmit a great breach of public faith and honour. He also thought thec present measure was as impolitc as it was unfair. The proposed reductiort would bave done good to the trade, put at a time when it was most needed-wher one of the Clhinese ports was quite -closed and the other tvo were in a state of danger, The merchants abroad sheuld have some fti mulus held out to send home their teac by the prospect of a fairly remunerative price, and suck they could not look for under the -Chancellor's nowv proposition. Xr. Locock seoonded the resolution, urging that it was impossible that thia very important branch of our xaitional commerce could go on from year to year with san, a paltry trifling on the part of the Government, not only with the arrangements of the trade, but with the promises and wellCromnded expectations of the pople of this country. In the present instance the oss fell heavily upon the trade, who had bonght largely, relying upon the legislative proMnise that the war taty would cease this April. (Cheers.) X r. Alderman 'Sidney supported the resolation, an
expressed his regret that snch an important trade as that in tea was not better represented in the House of Commons, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer would not have dared to tale the unjust liberties with it which he had done. In the present instance the trade was most hardly used, as -they had invested their capital upon the faith of an act of Parliament. (Hear, bear.) The resolution was put and carried by acclamation. Mr. Twining moved the second resolution, that a committee be appointed to confer with the Chancelor of the Exchequer upon tho subject, and to take such other steps aq may be deemed necessary to obtain a more equitable and less inconvenient arrangement, which was seconded by Kr. Rawson, both gentlemen contending that both consumers and brokers were alike made the scapegoats by the present unjust and illiberal alteration of the law. The resolution was carried nnaninously, and it was eventually determined to adjourn the proceedings till this day at 12 o'clock, when the subjc t of a dleputatioa to the Chancellor of the Exchequerwill be again brought under consideration. and the future steps to be taken by the comnmnittee decided. The proceedings were 2)nerously attended throughout,

Lyceum Theatre.
LYCEUM THEATBx.1
Lest night a now five-act play, in blank verse, written by Mr. West nd Marston and entitled A Life'e Ramsom, was brought oat with all the usual testimonials of success.
The action is laid in the reign of James II., just as that re'n is approaching its close. Lord Revesdale (Mr. C. Diln), a young nobleman whose family has been distinguished for loyalty to the Stuarts, but who has himself no objection to the views of the Prince of Orange, is the very incarnation of pride. His sister Felicia (Mrs. C. Dilon), on the other hand, loves Arthur (Mr. M'Lien), son to Matthew Ringwood (Mr. BaTrett), a rich courtry gentleman, whose father pursued the vocation of a brewer. As Lo-d Revesdale's fortunes are dilapidated an. his estates are about to be "sold up," the pride of birth might perhaps submit to an advantageous a]liance with the plebeian, did not a very uncomely magistrate, named Bancroft (Mr. Stusi.'), who equaLly hates Revesdale and Ringwood, constantly stir up the young nobleman'spride. When a letter comes from a Lord potent at the Court, holding out hopes that the Revesdale estates will be preserved in the family, and requesting the hand of Felicia, the determination of the young lady to abide by her rich though humbly-born lover is irritating to the last degree, and when her brother rushes from her in a fever of indignatinn his mind is quite prepared to receive any infusion of calumny. In this mood he is crossed by Bancroft, who drops hints as to an unbecoming intimacy between Felicia and Arthur, tiHl Revesdale, frantic about the family honour, begins to regret aloud that Arthur was once corcealed in his house when pursued by the soldiery, on account of his participation in the Duke of Monmouth's rebellion. This revelation is highly acceptable to Barcroft, who is a zealous agent of King James, and he departs determired to turn his information to practical use, thus greatly horrify ing Lord Revesdale, who finds that pride has tempted him to the commission of the meanest act,-the betrayal of a man who had confided in him. In a sudden fit of remorse he hastens back home to warn Ringwood of his danger, and fLnds him celebrating his wedding with Felicia. The nuptial feast confates the calumnies of Barcroft, but that unworthy gentlemau presertly enters with a troop of soldiers and arrests Arthur Rlngwood on a charge of high treason. To increase the agony of Revesdale, his sister Pilicia, hearing that he is the betrayer, calls down upon him the curses of those ancestors whose pictures surround the walls,
A great crime demands a leavy atorement. lord Ravesdale, determined to save the lives of Atrthur and.Filicia (who,
the crime of concealment, is ready to die with her husband), so far foregoes his pride as to fall on his knees before the detestable Bancroft, and beg that the affair may go no further. Tke sapplicatious are of no avail; but tilM one method of escape seems open to the unfortunate pair. Bancroft has heard of a formidable conspiracy for ir.viting the Prince of Orange to take possession of the English throne, and he would willingly let two Monmouthites go if he could but secure one Orangeman. Lord Revesdale strikes the bargain. He bas an Orangeman at his d;sposal, and will give him up if Arthur and Filicia are released. They leave their prison, and Revesdale yields up-himself. However, mclshief is prevented by that great historical event the landing of the Prince of Orange, which takes place before the eyes of the audience.
If the author had not bound himself to fill up five acts with a story wholly inadequate to such a purpose, he might have produced a drama interesting througlhout. From the moment when the proad man becomes contrite, and determines to save the victims of his pride, the sympathies are arrested, and there is no lack of strong situation. The imprecation of the afflicted sister is wrought up with great power, and at the close of the story much art is used n keeping the audience in suspense till the deus cx mci.nd actually arrives. However, it is not till towards the close of the third act that the exciting matter begins the first two acts being devoted to that mere poetizing wvhicZ so often stands as a formidable barrier between the dramatist and popularity. The characters are not strongly enough m arked to exhibit psychological development; it isthrough the incidents towards the conclusion that the play mainly succeeds, and hence there was every reason to start at orce in medics res, and avoid all unnecessary prelude. Pride is but a cold sort of passion to serve as a theme for dramatic treatment, nor does it in this play mould itself very easily to the purposes of the ar thor, since it is only when his pride is gone that his hero become a dramatic cbaracter.
Although Mr. and Mrs. Dillon were both suffering from such severe indisposition that the indulgence of the audience was claimed by Mr. Barrett, the stage manager, prior to the commencement of the piece, they exerted themselves to the utmost, and were rewarded by a call after nearlv every act. The gallantry of Revesdale, when honestly working in a good cause, is well suited to Mr. Dillon, and though Mrs. DiUlon's physical powers are rather severely taxed by the speech at the end of the fourth act, her energy is therefore the more remarkable. The scenic assistance afforded to the piece is of no small value. Indeed, had it not been for the sudden change from the interior of the prison to the view of the coast, with sea, and ships, and soldiers, and a very imposing Prince of Orange in the back groand, we much question whether the audience would have been nearly so well pleased at the preservation of the Revesdale family as they were last night. As it was, the author was twice called and twice bowed from his box, and the piece was announced for repetition every evening anmid loud applause.

JUVENILE VAGRANCY.-Last evening a general
JUVENITE VAGFANOY.-Last evening a general meeting of thejointmembers ofthe Law Amendment Society and the National Reformatory Union was held at No. 3, Waterloo-place, to consider the bill recently brought before Parliament for the suppression of juvenile vagrancy. Lord Brougham presided, and amnong others present were the Bishop of London, Sir Stafford Northcote, hLP., Lord Robert Cecil, M.P., the Lord Mayor, the Hon. Mr. Liddell, AL., the Rev. Sidney Turner, and a deputation was also
resent from the Birmingham Educational Association The gishop of London moved, "That in the opinion of this meeting it is desirable that a measure for the suppression of juvenile vagrancy, which is a fertile source of crimue, should be enacted." It must be obvious to every one that the private efforts which are made, admirable as they are for this end, are still quite unable to encompass the evil effectually. It seemed to him to be one of those things which caU for legislative interference. If the Legislature was justified in purnishing crime, surely it should take upon itself the means for the prevention of it, and he saw no mode so likely to effect that objectas the measure now proposed by Sir S. Northcote. The Lord Mayor seconded the motion. His experience had shown him that one of the greatest of existing evils was juvenile delinquency. It was quite true that for the most part juvenile vagrants were orphaus, and if we could pronide them with homes in the way proposed an immense saving would be effected to the State as well as good to the children themselves. He suggested that if the Government would allow some of the old men-of-war ships to be used as reformatory schools they would be admirably adapted to carrying out the object in view. Sir Stafford Northcote, in reply to several questions, said the payment to be made by pasents was not so much to relieve the poor-rates or Government funds as to imPreSS a feeling of responsibility upon parents of the fulfiment of their duty to their children. Since the operation of this provision the number of vagrant children had materially diminished, though in few cases had parents paid the fuU amount of 5s. a-week, They are, however, compeUed to pay as much as they can.
Th effect of the pressure t'hus exercised, had been that parents had been afraid of the charge upon them, and either sent their children to school, got them employment, or kept them at home, instead of allowing them to prowl about the streets on the chance of their being taken up by the police and committed to a reformatory. The resolution was carried unanimously. Considerable diseussion took place on the details of the measure and the suggestions contained in the report of the committee, in which the chairman, Lord R. Cecil, Sir S. Northeote, the Rev. S. Turner, Air. Elliott, Mr. D. Power, Mr. A. Hill, Mr. Anderton, and others took part. Some modifications in the details of the bill (wbich appeared to meet with the general support of the meeting) were then made by Sir S. Northcote. and the proceedings were brought to a close. The meeting was very well attended.
AGED POOR SocIETY.-Yesterday evening the anniversary festival of this society, established as early as the close of the 17th century, -as held at the Albion Tavern. His Eminence Cardinal Wiseman presided, supported by the Right Rev. Dr. Grant, the Right Rev. Dr. Morris. Mr. Swift, M.P., &c. The usual loyal and patriotic toasts were given with much eloquence and good feeling by the most rev. presideMn, who also, in the toast of the evening, urged the cause of the poor with force and pathos, illustrating his argument by the examples of many who formerly for years were contribo tors to the annual colleetions made at that festival, and who were now the recipients of its bounty, and between whom and the ignominy of the workhouse there was nothing to interpose save the benevolence of tbis society. For that reason, and for the aid of the 60 poor pensioners who depended upon the society, he pressed upon the company to contribute their utmost in aid of the aged destitute, to respond to the appeal while the heart was warm, and not wait till it was chilled into consideration by the gradual approaches of the subseription list. This significant peroration oavsreceived with much laughter and cheers, and shortly afterwards the secretary announced a handsome amount of subscriptions and donatoions. The dinner was good, and the musical arrangements were most excellent. Signor Piece, the blnd Sardinian -nihistrel, performed on the Tibia Pastorale (Angliod, a little whistle) in a most marvelUous manner, and well merited the applause which he received on all sides.
