Inquiry Into The Mortality On Board The Ship Duke Of Portland.
IHQUIBY IrTO TEf: JfORTALrrY ON BOARD
THE SHIP DUKE OF PORTLAND.
b ~~~-------- w -
The frightful mortality of Chinese on board tho British thip hDike of Portland has been t2e s5ecb of inrfstigatiok for several days before the Local Marine Board, Cornhi21lr. Duncan Dunbar chairman, -
Cgptain Seymour, the master of the Duke of Portland. deposed that the abip 3eft Hongkong with 332 Chinese cooies. The ehip had been measured for 334. She carried asurgeon, wliohod been all the voyage from London2 to New Zealnd, and thence to Chims, Who haed a diploma, and had
dby Captain lea, Government agent. They wrer0 to oe aid ^ lump s:wL per head for all the Chinese Icoolies 2anded alive at the Havannah-.nothingror thoae'ho doied. The eoolies appeared in good health when ahjppsed..
that' was the general opinion on leaving (ChSina There were ample medicines put on board by teowner. They bad
fater from China an excess. Captain Seymour here read a letter w/hich he had addressed to the owner; It Pwas datea
avarnnah, September 10, 156. The following extract referred to the subject-matter;of inquiry
,.I got Al my free emigrants on board on the SW1t of Iarch, and on the morning of the 2d of April all mI busl. nues and papers were in such a favourable way that ot leaving the ship I gave the mate orders to heave short, and at 2 o'clock to set the topsails. There had been a slight di. turbence on board on the evening before, on my insisting to have the lights out by 8 o'clock, but I attributed it to the excitement of their first coming on board, and tookno notice of it beyond arming and setting the sea watch. About 2 o'clock on the 2d I left the shore with my papers all in order, and proceeded on board the Julindur to get a box of musket caps, which I -was rather short of. I saw the mate mastbeading the topsails, andflatteredmyself all was right. Vain hope I I had not been on board five minutes when I saw the topsail halyardshad beenlet go, and the coolies crowding on the poop. Igot on boad in duuble quick time, ana. was followed by the captain and boats' crews from three other ships with whom I was acquainted, and the scene of riot and confusion that awaited my arrival I shall not soon forget
beingoccuple shintakenteorrhityofthemate'satten or beinoccpicinna)g ,eandabstractedtheirornbelaving pius, and armed themselv with what else they could on deck, principally firewood, and gained possession of the poop, and were ylig and shoutiug in a6 feafu manner, throwing everythgnnmoveable overboard, and had let go the topsail halyards. I cleared the poop as soon as I t en board, and endeavoured to address them, but it -w like ordering the troubled waves, many of them threatesi me with pieces of firewood. I sew I could do nothiing vrith them without bloodshed, so I thought I would consult Lyall, Slett, and Co., and the authorities (civil). I immoed. ately caled on the former, and they coolv informed me they cons dered the ship despatched, and had nothing further to do with it. I asked them for an introduction to Mr May the chief magistrate, wheo, after some hesitation one oF them accompanied me to the suPreme court, and I hadanin. terview with the second stipendTary maagistrate. Be kindly requested me to return on Voard and prevent further outrue. if possible, and he would follow me with a solice force,whicl
he accordingly did. The coolies actusUyl ughed at them, and dared the polce to fire upon them, and they were -altimately driven below at the point of the bayonet. It was then too late to get to sea, and I was not certainly prepared to keep 350 of such savages in subjection. I iminediately turnedthecoolies out of the cuddy, and took my crew aft, planted the two guns inside the cuddy door, loided thera with grape and canister, and oonstructed a strong barricade across the front of the poop, loading the carronades, which
had previously placed at thoe poop fife-rail, and was ths ready, at a momnenVs notice, to sweep the deck; gave the men a cutlass each, and kept a stand of loadedcarbines onL thepop Mr. Mday was then on board, and, finding
Ion te go to sea, he left a sergeant and five policemen for sentries during the night, and promised to senid an additional force at 4 o'clock the next morning, to ket order while I got under way, which he did, and at daylight I was out of the roads, and they 'left mealone in m glory.' I got on pretty fair for the first 40 hours, with the exception that they refused to cook, and conse. quently got nothing to eat. From the second day they began to cook, on and of, and likewise began to be noisy. The third davl bad the first suicide, and from this date until I passed the Straits of Sunda I had an average of about three overboard daily. They now also commenced threatening to burn the ship, and, my interpreter becoming alarme .I could not find the ringleaders. On the 14th their behavioxr was so noisy and mutinous that I resolved to take up the centre of the extension of the poop-deck, and I cothstracted a gallery round the quarter-deck to the gangways, and built gratings round the after batch, between decks, so as to preserve a free communication with the lower hold. About 7 o'clock p.m. they attempted to break up the lower deck hatches, and I had to place armed sentries over each hatch. On the morning of the I1th I discovered a plan they had laid to take the ahip. One or more of the invalids were to be thrown overboard, and during the absence of the boat to pick them up the coolies were to make a rush, obtain posseSsion of the poop, and murder aU hands reaerving the boat's crew to take %ho ship on shore, and the same afternoon they carried their plan out; but, as I was quite prepared for them, a few well-directed blows from the 1.at of a cutlass prevented the rush, and T. Wiliams jumped overboard and saved the man who had been thrown from the forecastle. After the failure of their attempt they became much quieter; but I had on an average from 12 to 18 in irons for riotous behaviour and attempted suicide. The weather was now dreadful, calm day after day, with the exception of an occasional thunderstorm, the thermometer ranging from 84 degrees to 90 degrees, sad I exhausted my ingenuity in devising maeans to increase the ventilation. I had fires In the after ventilator night and day, constructed an aircourse in the shaft through the forecastle, but the coolles would not work it, and the first night it was completed destroyed it entirely. The disinfectants were largely used in the between decks and lower hold, but to no purpose, they were so dreadfully dirty, and no pumshment I could devise would alter them in that respect, and for the fint six woeks I was at sea I had the passengers' deck thoroughly cleansed by the watch every morning. ButI coulId fill a volume on this subject and the horrorsby which I was surrounded. On the evening of the 28th there was an attempt to rescue one of their ringleaders whom I had put in irons. One of them threw a large bone at mne as twas endeavouring to pacify them. I then thought it time to clear the decks, and in the scusfe one of them wa& wounded inthe side. I called at the Cocoa Islands, in honpe of getting vegetables, fresh meat, and fish for the inva.hds, but was much disaipointed with theresult ofmy visit. We lost. 128 Chinese before arriving at the Havannah, chiefly from congestive fever; it is like the Hongkong fever. We lost one of the crew. I think the coolies brought the seeds of the disease on board with them. When they would not eat I have tried to force food down their threats. We were 150 days on our passage from Cbina to the Havannah. We remained three days at St. Helena. We had vegetables from St. Helena to within a few days of our arrval at the Havannah. All the opium for the Chinese was consumed before we arrived at St. Helena. The Chinese mutinied before we sailed from Hongkong, on account of their wanting more maoney. I believe one-third of them were kidnapped. They had spent the mo £ey they bad before leaving China. The surgeon was kind to them. I was with them much more than the surgeon was. He (the surgeon) saw them always tW ice a-day. The Chinese were shipped under direction of the chief magistrate. I have a document from him stating that all required for them was shippd. The entries regarding the assistance rendered by the magistrato at Hongkong were madeca day or two alter in the official log. The opium required by law was put on board in China, and I got more at St. H2[elena. I gave the doctor full authority at St. Helena to get all the opium and medicines he required." [Entries in the official
regarding the disturbance prvious to sailing, the medic treatment, and the Ilans for giving more dri to thebi grants, were theu rea CaptainSeymour added,-" The ship is 633 tons. The emigrants had the whole of the lower deck, excepting the cuddy. We could see the difference betw6en those who died from congestive fever and those who suffered from the want of opium. In April the thermometer in my cabin ranted from 82 deg. to 90 deg. The season of the year was bad for them. The ship had scuttles. Sbh has carried emigrants before. I was 100 days to St. Helena. The loss of the monsoon in the China Sea was caused by our detention in China. They could net get the people ready for shipping. We sailed from Hongkong on the 2dof April. Only one man was injured in the disturbance. He was wounded TheJohn Calvin sailed about thrte weeks beforenme, and arrived after mne. The scurvy was frightful on board that ship. We had none. I was told by tho Cosnli at tho Havannah that I was the first ship arrived there without scurvy on board. I was without a chief mate for two months coming home. He was below sick, and offthe Cape, too in the bad weather."
At the close of the examination of the witnesses the Chairman announced the decision of the board :-"' That no blame attaches to the owner and master, or any one connected with the ship. That Captain Seymour's conduct to the emigrants apprs to have been kind and attentive, ad that everypossibl precaution was used by him to decrea
the mortality. Dr. Ludgage appears also to have exertod himself fortheoamepurpose, ltapPears to this board that thc mottality was greatly aggravated by the great heat and unussal length of the passage (150 days), caused by the sail. ing of the ship in an improper season. She sailed fuly one month later than seh ought to have done to enable her to get down the China sess."

I he English funds have not expprienced any per)ranent change to-day, but such temporary movenents as have occurred have been still downward. COnDIS for money opened at 93i to J, and returned to that price after having declined to 934. For the bth of February the lsst quotation was934 to i, while for the new account in March it was 931 to {. The depreesion in the morning was chiefly caused by speculative sales, consequent uDon anticipations of al Advance in the Bank rate of aiscount to-morrow, but later in the day an op 'te view appeared gene. rally to prevail. Bank Stock left off at 216i to 21; Reduced, 93A to i; New Three per Cents., 937; India Stock, 219 to 221- Exchequer-bonds, 99 to 4; and India-bonds and kxchequer-bills, 3s. discount to Is. premium.
Foreign eecurities were steady, but the operations continue limited. The arrangement of the account checks the ordinary activity. Turldsh Six per Cents. were dealt in at 94#, i, i and j,; the Four per Cents. Guarauteed for money at 1024, and for the account at 103A; Venezuela showed firmness at a slight advance, bargains having taken place at 36% for money, and 374 for the account. The general business comprised-Brazilian Four-and-aHalf per Cents., 98; Chilian Six per Cents., 104, 1034, ana 104 ; New Grenada Active, 21i; Mexican, 214 and ; Portuguese Three per Cents., 43i; Rusian Four-and-a-Balf per Cents., 96; Sardinian Five per Cents., 89i; SpanishNew Deferred, 23A, and Dutch Four per Cents. Certificates, 98, 97i;-and 98i.
The corn-market this morning was firmer in tone, but without any decided change in quotations.
The fnal prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 10c. for money, and 6t£ 20c for the end of the month, showing a urther fall of nearly a ha6 l per cent. All other deacriptions of securities like.ise exhibit extreme heavinesk . t hris movement is perhaps partly attributable to the reaction in London, but there appears to be a great scarcity of money, and cigh rates are likely to be exacted during the liquidation about to commence.
A further sum of 80,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation to the continent.
The demand for money in the Stock-Exchange t-day was rather less active, but 6 per cent, was paid for advances on Government securities. In the icount-market there was increased pressure, and at the Bank of England the applications are beleved to be very numerous, and in many cases of a character to indicate that the commercial public do not leek for any early approach to an easier state. The existing drain of bullon is remarkable for its cteadiness, and, although it has been counteracted during the past fortnight by a r thereturot large amount of sovereigns transmitte tto Ireland during the recent bank panic, it may be expected henceforth to produce a marked effect. The contingencies
on the favourable side are the possibility of a partal resumption of remittances from America, the promise of 400,0001. in silver from Mexico, the inmediate prospect of an arrival of Australian gold ships, and the probability that the fal in the corn market may check shipments of wheat to this country and thus operate favourably on the cxchanges. EVen, however, if all these circumstances should be realized, they will, perhaps, not more than ufficeto prevent the market from acquiring greater stringency. According to the latest accounts from
.the Bank of France, the bullion in that estbl s,hmnent is again diminishing, and every effort will therefore be mado to attract funds from this side whenever an opportunity shall present itself.
At a meeting of the United Mexican Mining Association held tday the report of the directors, after a^ lengthened discussion, was adopted, and it was agreed to empower them to raise the remaining 6,5001. of the 21,*5001. voted in 1854 to carry on the
aorkings of the Jesus Maria Mine, the returns from which have latterly improved.
Advices from Paris state that the construction of the Ferdinand Railway of Tuscany, the particulars of which were put forth in London yesterday, ha ari been contracted for by Messrs. Burroni Brothers, of Florence, at a sum of 732,0001., or ff8,0001. below the amount of the guaranteed capitaL The caution money of 4-,0001. has been deposited.
It is expected that the letters by the overland mail will arrive and be delvered is n the course of tomorrow.
The returns of idrculation of the Irish and Scotch banks for the four weeks ending the 20th of December, when added together, give the following as the average weekly circulation of these banks during the past month, viz.:
verage circulation of the Irish banks . 7,307,803 average circulation of the Scothe banhkl ... 4,349,383
Average circulation during past month ....£11,6a6,686 On comparnng the above with the fixed issues of the several banks, as given in thc Basndind AnmIrac, the following appears to be the ,tate of the circulation:
the Irish banks are above their fxed issue .. £952 809 The Scotch bankn are above their fixed issue .. 1,262174
Total above the fixed issue .£. the .. c2,214,983 The amounts of gold and silver held at the head offices of the several banks during, the past mnonth have been as follows:-
G'old and silver held by the Irish banks ... £7.,622,687 G-old and silver held by the Scotch banks ... 1,829,185
TotSal of gold and silver held . £...4,451,872 The above statements complete the returns of the circulation in England, Scotland, and Ireland for the month ending the 20th of December, 1856, which were partly inserted in The Tiones of the 28th of January.
These returns, combined with the average circulation of the Bank of England for-the same period,
wfill give the following, results of the. circulation of. notes in the united k;ungdom when compared with; the previous month:
showing a decrease of 1,313,3471. in the circuLation of notes in England, and a decrease of 1,527,1031. in the circulation of theunitedkingdom, when compared with the month ending the 22d of November. And, as comparedwith the month ending the22d of December, 1855, the abovereturnsshow an increase of 138,2291. in the circulation of notes in England, and an increase of 350,8731. in the circulation of the united Idngdom.
The average stock of bullion held by the Bank of England in both departments during the month ending the 20th of December was 10,525,9861., being an increase of 848,9161.fas compared vwith the previous month, and a decrease of 622,7061. when comnpaled with the same period last year.
The stock of specie held by the Scoteh and Irish banks during the month ending the 20th of December was 4,451,8721., being an increase of 74,4031. as compared with the previous return? and an increase of 211,8821. when compared wilth the core siponding period last year.

" The wheat trade," Iayg linneyand Co.'s Cirular, " hba been Yery dull, and so little Is passin6 fnforeign wheat that quotations are quite nominal. The interior markets continue to be abundantly aupplied with home-grown, and at pricez considerably leea than either foreign can be imported for or holder of stock in granary here are willing to
00Dt.aking a retrospective view of the amount of buniness that has ueen done in foreign wheat for home consamption at this place, for the last six weeks or two months, we are almost resoy to come to the concludon that 'our occupation is gone. The trade altogether is at sixes and sevens, and confidenee appears to be lost. The condition of new wheat prevents landing even f speculators were inclined to inTest; and untl the grower maes a stand, and ceaes to supply the markets to such an extent as at present, we see no pro tof i. prorement; ner can we see that the Dresent pressure is at all warranted under exisAting ciramntaurces connected with the trade,-L e. the extensive demand for the roninaula, and the Probable requirementa of France and otber places.
At to-day's market there was a moderate ra pl of wheat from the growers, and, tbo condition being inferior, and the report from Mark. lane depressing, prioes again dropped from Is. to 2g. per quarter, and in tome cases as much as 3s., but rio gret amount of business was done.

THE FRENCH CENSUS.-"Two extremely serious
THE FRENCH Cmi>sus.-" Two extremely serious facts," says the AssemJje Xationale, "have been brought to ligh by the French official census of 1856, and which have not only excited the attention of tho public, but formed the subject of consideration in the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences at one of its recent sittings, The first fact is an almost complete interraption in the progress of the national population since the census of 1851, and the second is the extraordinary tendency evinced during the same period by the people of the country districts to remove to large towns, and particularly to the Capital. From 1851 to 86 France, acrding to the last cnsus, has only gained 256,000 inhabitants. In the same number of yews, from 1841 to 1846, the increase was 1,200,000. If these two numbers are correct the difference is enormous. It may be in part explained by the simultaneous action of the cbolera, the scarcity of food, and the war; but, even with these explanations, the falling off is very considerable. What gives still more gravity is that the quinquennial period from 1846 to 1851 had given an analogous resultnamely, an increase of only 380,000 aou.s, according to which the population has scarcely increased for the last 10 year While the general progress of the population is checked its removal from one paxt to anotherhaataken place in proportions.hitherto unheard of. The department of the Seine alone in the lst five years has gained 300,0
-that is to say, 50,000 more than thewholo of France. It had not'gained more in the first 30 years of the century, and In tho 18 years of the monarchy of 1830. This sudden augmentation, which is almost wholly owing to accidental ciriimstances, ca-not fail to inspire a certain uneaines for the futWre. In addition to its explgIning, as the Prefect of the Seine- )usly -remarked in his report, tlbe present high rate of rent andifood, there is reason to fear that this dearness wil continue. On other points such as Lyons, Mareillcej St. Etienne, and largtowns in general, tho movement of increse; -without being io great as in Pris, has been very considerable. - At the sume time, by a forced cono
aqWace, Z4,deg%rtments, or two-thirds of the territory, have decreased population ha manner never before seen; and 3mdst of thewe de ments are esentially agricultniaL 8ome of them-the Haute-Saone amna the number-Wve lost o re enth of their number of inhabitants."

Crinoline's Raging Fury.
CRINOLUMS RAGING FURY.
From Punc) You rutic mamas. 0 oelgianf,
Who dress yourselves with ease, Ah. little do you think how hard
It is French tste to pleas. Give ear unto the milliners,
And they will plainly show,
With what care, tight with air,
They our Crinolines do blow. All you that wMll be modish
Must bear a steadfast heart-
For when boys gibe you in the streets,
You must not blush nor start; Nor must you be disgusted
To hear them cry, " Haho I
" I should think 7ou wil shrink
" Give your Crnoline a blow l' The bitter jests and sarcasms
A poor girl must endure
And look a fright to dress aright,
Are grievous, to be su - Our skirts they are derided
For being puffed out so,
That by steam, it would seem, We our Crinolines do blow.
Iw growls like distant thunder,
Which gruffness doth enforce,
We oft hear things old fogies say,
Beyond all bearmng coarse; This causes indignation,
And makes our anger glow; But disdain is in Tain,
And our Crinolines we blow.
Sometimes when Neptune's bosom
Is tossed with stormy waves, A Ld walks out shoppng,
Anawind and weather braves; Borne off her legs she mounteth,
And coneth down so slow,
Broad and light, with such might, We our Crnolrnes do blow. A maid exerts the bellows
To bloat us round about,
When Woman!s rm doth fail us,
Then man's must bel.p it out; We ring for .ohn's assistance-
For he is strong, we knowTo help pufl us and stuff us
When our Crinolines we blow. The husband and the lover
May simple gowns prefer,
That fit the form, and in a storm With safety let one stir -
Reproaches fierco, our hearts that pierce,
Against our taste they throw, Which we poor things endure,
While our Crinolines we blow. We put on costly merchandise
Of most enormous rice, So much we need of dr
To follov this device;
We spend so much in drapery,
Of such a size to show,
And with toll our shape spoil
When our Orinolines we blow.

PBAY BRUBUABER DOWB.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TImES.
Sir,-I have been expecting to hear a growl from some sour veteran respecting two neat little jobs which really deserve to be brought before the public, in order that they may appreciate the amiable fondness of our tender War Minister for the members of his family and the intensity of his domestic affections. I have beea disappointed so far as you are concerned, but in private I have been satiated by unmreasonable complaints. "Dowb again," I do de. clare I Are yoa aware, Sir, that the gaUant and distinguished and highly fortunate young officer alluded to has been "remembered " onoe more? He is restored to the service of his country, and with an anxiety for active employment which does him credit he very soon abandoned the easy indolence of a " substantive's" life, and has girded on his sword again.
You may remember, Sir, that he was " remembered" by electric telegraph, and was put on the Staff, and made a major. The brevet rank he exchanged for " substantive." So did many others, but they had not the luck of our young friend, for on the very first opportunity he was "remem. bered again," and was placed on the active list, and he is now in full blow as maior of a depot battalion at Colchester. In that position he is on a par with a regimental major, which, considering that he was gazetted as ensign 30th of June, 1848, and has therefore only 81 years' service, is " doing tolerably wel."
Now, don't let it be supposed I object to Major Dowbiggin, who is a young officer, I understand, of fair abilities, because he is Lord Panmnrs nephew. What I do object to is that because he is Lord Panmure's nephew he has reeeived an appointment which officers of at least equal ability and longer service seek in vain.
But this is not all. The Major has a cousin whose case affords another touching instance of the fervour of Lord Panmure's family affections.
My Lord's sister married, as is duly chronicled in the Peerage, a Mr. Young, and of that marriage there was issue a Thomas Young, who entered the army. Now, it does so happen that a Captain Thomas Young, of Her Majesty's Service, 22d Regiment, whose services in the field are not recorded, and whose military career has been of the most peaceful character, has recently been appointed Deputy-Assistant Quartermaster-General at Aldershott-a snug berth, which has been the much desiderated object of many a poor war. wornCrimean offlcer; but not only was this yoang and gallant offlcerappointedwithoutanysuperiorclaim,exeeptthatwhich may be deduced from the facts above stated, but Captain Eager, of the 40th Regiment, an old and gallant offlcer, who held the post, was set aside to make room for him, and was sent to some musketry school to earn an addition of Is. 6d. a-day to his pay by teaching rifle practice. Captain Eager served through the operations in Candahar and Affghanistan was severely wounded at Beni-badam, was at Mahuaapore, where he wasagain wounded, and also served in the Crimea till he was obliged to return from ill health, caused by hi5 wounds and exposure to the Crimean winter.
Such is the belief and rumour in the camp with respect to the nomination of Captain Young. I have never seen him or Captain Eager in my life, but I oannet help saying that on the public statement of the claims of these two officers, as they appear in Hartes Army Liist, it is disgraceful that such jobs should be perpetrated by thoso who kindly undertake to conduct its affairs.
I should be happy indeed to hear that I am in error, and that my assertions can be refuted. Until then
I am, Sir, your very obedient servant.

The Undermanning Of American Ships.-The
THE I.NDRR',%UW G OF AR ICAs SxnPs.-The records of our polce-court this week furnish us with another incontestable proof that the dreadful system of cruelty which prevails on board American ships arlse from the circumstance of their being undermanned. We asserted in our last that this was the fact, and proved the assertion by returns, furnished by the American Government, of the relative strength of the crews of British and American vesels Some people, however, contend that as figures can be made to prove anything, they therefore prove nothing. Bnt if such objectors were not convinced by the figures which we quoted last week, they will surely admit that our argument was correct when they consider the facts elicited in connexion with the case of cruelty on board the Albert Gallatin, which have already appeared in the newspapers. A complete exposure of the low standard of morality inuced by tho short-handed system was furnished by the evidence of one of the witnesses for the defence, who, while denying that any unusual amount of craeltv had been inflicted upon these poor foreigners, admitted that he himrelf had been frequently kicked by the officers of the vessel, and justified the degrading punishment on the incon-
testable g nd that ' a kicking sometimes does a fellow good 1'-we should not be doing our duty if we omitted to mention that the offenders in this case were brought to justice by the agency of a very useful but unassuming soCiety in this town, instituted for the protection of poor foreigners in distress. We have no wish to dwell further upon the horrors which are involved in the unfortunate system of which we complain; but we must again appeal to Anericans as well as Englishmen to use all po9sible efforts to have this matter speedilyreformed. It has been alleged-not without good reason, perhaps-that our authorities are too lax in dealing with such cases when they are officially brought before them, but we all kno how sensitive the Amencans ar upon any point affecting their national independence of character, an it is more than pro. bable that if our magistrates were to inufict upon all such offenders the severe punishment which they certainhy deserve we should very soon be brought into serious coltiion with our Transatlantic brethren. F or ourselves, we believe that if the attention of American statesmen and of the American people be properly caled to the subiect by the English people and inglish statesmen there will be more chance of thi8 foul stan bein removed from the character of the American commercia marine than if it wero attempted to be accomplished by a vigorous application of English lawn pon Amierican o endar.-Livepool Cotsrirr.
-)ARNnG BURGLAlR s.-Several burglarie4 have recently been committed at Exeter, and attempts made to enter public offices and merchants' counting-houses. A daring attempt was made a few nights ago to break into the stamp-offlie, which is situated in Queen-street. Several holes were fonnd to have been drilled with a centrebit through a wooden slide in the vindow, -which Is fastened with bolts on the inside. The burglar or burglars must have been well acquainted witn the position of the bolts, as the holis were drilled diretlyopposit to them, the object being to slide them back, by which n itrance could. eaily have been effected. A lad named Cossins, the son of a respect-. able builder of Exeter, has been takken up on suspicion and remanded by thamagiatrates.

The Late Princess Lieven.
Mt LAATE ?RP?AYCSS UttEYN.
(From the rorning`Post )
All wbo are acquainted with the beat ioO!ely of thenost agreeble and lively of esaitals, Paris, aire *ware that one very prominent and noticeable personago for s lobgjo?ies of yea has of late been absent from thei oar6c of .the Faubourg St Germain and Chauss6e d'Antin-hs been.iAissed at the Russian and Prussian embaf-iAe qt llQ.
in the Faubourg St. Honore or the Bo5i do. oulogino-has not received on her accustomed eveningsatho6mew,rassisted at any of the grand doin, at the Tileries,'or the pay doings elsewhere. The political and fashionable publio an Paris had for the last fortnight been aware that Mame de Lieven was confined to the hobuo with what wBs by some called a cold, and by some an inflammation- buit was not till three or four days ago that it became nosd. aOroad that. the indisposition was much gtAver thai any one had imagined; and on Sunday last, when sll the world was flocking to see the Persiau Ambaiador and his suite, it was announced for eertain that a lady, who has played so prominent a part in mnore thaa one European capital, was then lying in a hopeless state without a chance of ultimate recovery. Within little-more than 30 hours the rumour proved to be well founded for on Monday evening Madame de Lieven, who has for full half a century led so busy and so public a life, died in thenansion which she had so recentlyken 'on her retir from Brussels. Thus, on so short ana sudden a warning, is called away the confidential correspondent of three OCar#, of three Empresses, of Grand Chancellors. Chamborl*ink and Governors of Russian provinoes without number-a woman who exercised in her time as muchroliticalandtocila infiuence, and perpetrated as mueh political miwaief,at any lady of the generation to which she belong&L It as now more thLn 18 years since the husband of Madame de lieven died at Rome, and it is netliy a quartir of a centnq since he ceansed, in 1834, to be -Russian Minister iu this capital; so that to manty of our idaers it may be necessary to state whe and what the Lievenz were, what functions they fillea, and what Infltuence they exercised. The firs of thefamily of whom any mention is made in history wan one John, HenrylAevent, a native of Livoni, a soldier of fortnune L ier Chatiee.xa. After the battle of Pultowa, atwhich Lievenl wanmot present, he was sent as a kind of aaent.oothetpti".KI at Benkder. Charles, pleased with his zem4- set imN to t- stantinople to negotiate in his favour, and to induo6 the Sultan to break with Russiak A portion of this'misdion was executed so sucoessfully that Charles appoin ted the %egL. tiator lieutenant-General, Senator, and Governor 'of the great Swedish harbour of Carlsacrona. Twayounper brothers of this Swedish adventurer subeequently accepted' service in Rusda under Catherine IL,and both of them obtained the rank of general. One of these, Andrew Lieven, married a Mademoiselie de 'Poeme, a lady of some wealth and of considerable talent, and from this union sprang Andrew Lieven, born in 1777, theb'hus. band of the lady whose unexpected death has caused so greAt a sensation among the diplomatic bodv both here and

and attainments than by her beuy t~~g h arrak able in early andaeven in middle life fri zrsi''u intelligent countenance, The family of nedofhoe in 1807 the entire confidence of AleadrTefthro Madame de Lieven was one of the German coterei which the Czar delighted. Her brother was the Imperial aiae-decamxpnandsoon after his chosen Ministr of Police, possessinghi entire confidence, and carrying on the Czar's secrt correspondence with his own empirei and foreign Courts. So connected and so patronized, the Lievens obtained the P'russian embass at the close of 1807 or t'he beginning of 1808, at which they remained accred:ited, if we mistake not, from 1808 to 1812. We say they remained aeccreited for it was, even in 1809 and 1810, a notorious fast that EMatam de Lieven nob merely received and did the honours of her husband's house, but carried on an extensive business'and official correspondence with her mother-in.ltw, who enjyoyd the full confidence of the Ronmanoff family; with herbrother, the favourite aide-de-camp of the Czar; and even with the Czar himself. When the Frenchx invasion of Rumssi ut an end to nearly all intercourse between the Courts ofSt Petersburg and 8,Berlin, IiL and Madame de IAeven ee sent to London to represent the Court of theCbo oe ,where towards the close of 1812.

In this latter year the WaY had sor W4- ingratiated hersself with the aristocray of ranik and foablon in London that she was esteemed a general favourite,'aiid.&
eatacqisiiontothe cmT-s dip7oftaique. With the peace, r,oweve,came the con1uict of interests and intrci 6s and from 1815 to 184 Madame de Lieven was muc o remuanite and intri ning to be regarded with favour by English statesmen and po iticiaus of any pat. Daring the strugg le s for Greek. independence she aid as much as in her, ly to foster the enthusiasm of young and old in England for the Greek- cause, not that the ambassaifresi or the Czar cared arush for Greek hberty if it couianot ,o made ,ub. servient to the weakening of TuLrkey and tite aggrandize. ment of Russia. In 1827, again, she *ad -orec-busy in the domnestic intrigues of the time, and was vez7ampartialiy, and,weobelieve, very truly, accui&dof plyigfalse to both parties-to the Cannin 'tea andWise h n hand, and to the Tories on the other Be-this asiti may,certia-int is that after the death of Canning and the baLttle of Navaiine, the sympathies of this busy intriguing -woman, and of the Court represented by her and hr 1husbabdid lay with his bitterest opponents and the o pnents of all liberal unprovemnt in England. In Ire?aNd, hoiwever, the Rmsalan embas played a distinct and separte game. In that country there were not wanting adroit Russian a,ent to, announceo to the Roman CLtholic agitators that the Czar sympathized with their sufferings and their wrongs. Fortunately the Duke of Wellinigton, by introducin$ thet Roman Catholic Relief Bill nipped in the bud these na.iient sym athies of two churchs the Grek and Romilsh, wrhich in aE other countries have h'ated and persecuted each other with true theologic raLncour.
Busy as Madame de IAeven made hersel in the Greek and Roman Catholic questions, she was stfIlmore active-Anct i'ntriguing in the diwscussons touching the Reform Bi1l1mdt the establishment of Belgium as a kingdom. N-otwithstauding all Russian male and female efforts, both measures were, however, conducted to a happy issue. The consolidation of Belgium was a great European benefit, which has stood the test of time ; and the glory of the struggle and of the success which crowned very arduous labours is chiefly due to, the present First Lord of the Treasury (then Secretary of Foreign Affairs) and to M. de TalUeyrand. Soon after the labours of the Conference of London, IL and Madama Lieven were recalled to St. Petersburg. M. de Lieven was appointed governor and tutor of the Cezar*itsch (now Emperor), and with that Imperlal Prince made Ilia tour of a great part of Southern Europe. At Rome he was seized with a sudden illness--an illnes of which he died onx the 10th of January, 1839.
After the decease of her husbandaMadamae de Lieven, who ad laye soimportant a part, could not remaiu idle. Sh salsed herself in Paris in 1839 and 1819 int a larg and handsome mnansion, and congregted about her the chief political and literary celebrities of France. Iniher boudoirs the principal business of the Ruscian embassy was done. She h#A her correspondents sand
her offid6ls in every part of EuroPe, and the information
obtained from them -was forwarded either tobher brother, the Minister of the Russian P'olice, the General Aid&-deCam p Benkencdorf, or directly to the Czar hi~mself. Madame de Leven, in fact, enjoyed as much of the confidence of Nicholas as her late mother-in-law, who was made Princess
In 1826, and addressd, by order of Nicholas, as aZ
Highness. For a short period during the embaLssy of M. Guizot Mfadame do Lieven retumned to this country to lend her prestige to that austere Calvinist, whoso motto as a dliplomatist was lincca reta brevissima. How much this virtuous manpJrofited by Russian female teaching s pro'ved by his course i4 the Spanish marriages. After the fall of Louis Philippe Madame do Lieven removed her diplomatic office to Brussels, to which city M. Guizot, by way of reciprecating Madame do Lieven's London journey, paid a vi1sit. But neither the ex-French ambassador nor the oxRussian ambassmiress could accmplish their respective designs, and we do not know that the world is mnuch the worse for their respective failures.
The system of employing women in affairs of State i& an exclusively RussiaLn system, and is in every way pregnant with the worst results. Females of thet German houses of Wurtemberg-Strelltz and OldenburM, andl dauighters of the Czar.Nicholas himself, ha-ve beenal engaged in these equivocal transacwtions, in whieh they can sea pn credit or honour-in which the grace and bloom, and inocence of the female chiaracter are entirely destroyed. We trust we have seen the last of these feainle diplomatists. Apart froma hier political intrigue Maame do Lieven was a woman of accomplishment, attainmet, and esprit;- a good a'~nst an excellent musaicin a good historlaiansh poess=Zed talnt
aLnd attainments which in the humblest station maust have raised her to imnportance.

London, Thursday, January 29, 1857.
ILOZDON, THURSDAY, JANUABY 29, 187.
No wounds are so sore and so slow to heal as those which any military miscarriage inflicts on the pride of a people. The English nation has certainly as little to complain of in this respect as =ny of its neighbours. In spite of incompetence, favouritism, and a defective military system, it has 3nmined, by means of courage, perseveranec, znd profuse expenditure, to fight, and, in the end, beat its enemie3 in every part of the woeld. But perhaps for this very reason the country is the more restless under the consciousness of not having done itabest on any particular occasion. :People do not seem to forget the Crimean campaign. Neither NeuchUel, nor Bushire, nor Canton, nor the Income-tax, nor grievances pre8tent, nor reforms to come can abate the interest with which the publhe receives any details concerning the glories and disasters of the great expedition. We ourselves should be -willing to leare. the whole affair to history. The duty of The journalist is to record the octurlences of the
day, to pronounce an opinion on them, and to extract from them lessons for- imj iae7 When other events supervene and other phases in the nation's affairs arrive he may well abandon the discussion of themes that belong to the past, even though there should remain a party still interested in refuting aU he has advanced. We should therefore be content to leave unnoticed the endeavours of any noisy clique to alter the public Judgment about the war, were it not that many of the changes which the breakdown of 1854 showed to be necessary have yet to be realized. The inquiry into the purchase system still remains an inquiry, military education stiU exists only a vague purpose, which the inattention of the public may permit to dissolve, and there is no guarantee that a few years may not bring back the whole organization of the army to what it was at Gallipoli and in Bulgaria. We cannot, therefore, but be glad that on the eve of a session in which so much is to be done the public should have so complete an exposure of the injustice and bad faith of the military authorities as is given in Sir JOHN M'NEzu's answer to the address from Liverpool. Let any impartial person consider the manner in which these two gentlemen-Sir JoH,ir M'N'ILL and Colonel TuLLocu-have been treated, and he will have no difficulty in forming an opinion on the merits of the men to whom the military credit of the country was confided, the working of the system they established, and the notions of fairness and chivalrous dealing which they contracted during their service. The correspondence shall tell its own story. It is no longer the irresponsible newspaper or the independent member of Parliament that speaks, but the Commissioners themselves, the men who were intrusted with an important, and, as it is proved, a dangerous inquiry, who discharged it honestly, and who now come forward and boldly charge the Government with conduct to the last degree cowardly and dishonest.
A few weeks since some of the chief persons connected with the town of Liverpool, including in their number men of all parties, the mayor, the boroughl members, the chairmen of the principal associations of the town, and three-fourths of the magistracy, determined to express their approval of the services of the Crimean Commissioners, and their tbanks for the manner in which those gentlemen had exposed the gross mismanagement of the war. It is needless to say that the treatment of Colonel TILLoCH in the presence and by the connivance of the Chelsea Board, the attack on the report by Mlr. PmEI, and the grudging acknowledgment of the Commissioners' service extorted from the superior personages of the Administration, concurred to produce from this independent commercial community its expression of opinion. Sir JoHN ATNEiLL, in his reply to the Secretary, Mr. EwvAuT, gives vent to the indignant feelings which the sorry requital of his services has roused. "I may be " permitted to add," he says, in allusion to the address, " that its value is enhanced by its being the " only public document I possess which contains " an acknowledgment that any service whatever " was rendered by the Commission." The proceedings of the Government, he says, in another place, " appear to have produced a very general
impression that the acknowledged fidelity of our report was not in accordance "with their wishes, and the feeling thus
produced must affect the disposition of the "coiuntry to intrust to the Executive any in"quiries connected with the army which may " hereafter be calUed for." On the desire of the War Department to " discredit the Commissioners " and neutralize their report," on the subsequent conduct of the Government, as indicating a similar disposition, and on the tardiness of Lord PANsiunE, who, 12 months after the issue of the report, gave a cold approval of it in an incidental speech at Arbroath, Sir J. M'Nzn remarks in calm but decided language. As to the Chelsea Board, he pronounces an opinion fully in accordance with the sentiments of all who watched the proceedings of that unscrupulous tribunal. "Of the report of the "Board I need only say that I consider it a " suitable result of the proceedings which led to it, "and which are not calculated, I fear, to impress "the people of this country with profound
admiration of the taste, the feeling, or the spirit in which they were carried on." In conclusion, the senior Commissioner reiterates his charge of negligence and incapacity. The resources of this country, of the neighbouring Turkish provinces, large fleets of transports, a number of ocean steamships, and unbounded supplies of money were at the command of the British Commander and his subordinates. No part of the army was distant more than seven miles from a secure harbour, and a considerable part was encamped within a, mile or two of the port. " Yet the
country is expected to believe that it was impossible, by any exercise of talents, energy, or "foresight, to provide either sufficient food or
snfficient clotbing for 20,000 or 30,000 men." Such is the deliberate reply of Sir JoiN M'NEILL to an address from the first commercial commiunity in the kingdom.
Colonel TULLOCH is, by his military position, debarred from so bold an avowal of his sentiments; but he does not hesitate to complain of the Chelsea Board, and to reiterate the truth of all to which he set his hand. We may further remark that in a work just published the Colonel proves fiom statistical returns the excessive and preventible mortality in the army. " Even that of Walcheren," he observes, " did not exceed a fourth part of the " average here recorded." In shoLt, the two Commissioners seem at length to have determined that the neglect and injustice with which they have been treated shall not remain without a protest. They have seen, and the public have seen too, their honesty questioned, their motives impugned, their right to common courtesy denied by the insolent and vindictive class which had just lowered the reputation of England to a point dangerous not only to the honour but to the safety of the State. They have been subjected to the flippant attacks of a subordinate of the Government and the un-
generous silence of the statesmen who sent them on their thankless mission. The time has now come when it is necessary for their own reputation that they should protest against these injuries. It is no secret that the worst military set has received encouragement from the treatment of the Commissioners, and that the conduct of the Govermment has caused every officer engaged in any pending inquiry to believe that he will beat consult his own interests by a report in accordance with the preconceived notions of his superiors. If Sir JOHN M'NEIzm and Colonel TuTLLOCH succumb they are lost men. An organized body, intent on misrepresentation, has considerable advantages e\ven over such great institutions as a free Parliament and a free press. We already find with what boldness a certain class is prcsuming on the forgetfulness of the public, and endeavouring to build up the shattered reputation of the chief officers in the Crimea. If the Commissioners were to acquiesce in the decision of Chelsea and the War-office we should have in a year or two a history of the campaign in wvhich they would be intioduced as the most ignorant or malicious of mankind, and in which it would be triumphantly pointed out that their statements had been. declared erroneous by a duly constituted trbunal; that the, judgrment had been confirmned by the Government which emipiloyed
theim ind that'they Ihad cndIed~ by thefir silence the jus,ticeof .thedecisioll. But iowi we trust the matter will be againi discussed in a larger and more equitable court. When Parliament meets so0me member can Scarcely fail to notice the charge brought against the autlhorities by a man in the high position of Sir J. MNxrLL. Either the Chelsea Board is right, and the Government may fairly state their disapprobation ofthe Commissioners' Report, or the Commissioners have been most scandalously wronged, and the Government is bound to do them justice. But this is not a mere personal matter. The interests of the nation demand that men employed on a public service shall not be exposed to injury from the ill-will of any class or profession. If Sir J. MNzmL and Colonel T;iiocn be not righted there is an end of all good to be expected from any future inquiry in which men dependent on the Government may be engaged.

Mr. HENRY MAYHEW has mistaken his vocation.
Mr. HENRY MYHEW has mistaken his vocation. The entertainment he gave the public in Farringdon-haU on Tuesday evening ought to have been at DIrury-lane. The ticket-of-leave men ought to have been a picturesque assemblage of outcasts, patriots, or bandits, all wearing a holly twig, or a white scarf, or a red cross, or some other distinguishing emblem. The noble chairman ought to have greeted them one by one in a satin doublet, slashed nether garments, lace ruffles, and feathers. Mr. MAHEwIw himself ought to have been dressed like the secretary of a Sovereign Duke in the 16th century. The performance ought then to have consisted of a gay rollicking song, a lively conversation, an impassioned recitative, and a solemn conjuration or oath, sung by the whole coIIIpany, rising for the purpose, and shaking hands all round. This would have been intelligible, and, if not severely instructive, at least very impressive. We should have been content to look for the meaning in the sequel. The French Revolution was full of scenes got up with the best effect, with more or less of costume, and with the deepest sentiment. But the proceedings on Snow-hill appealed so little to the imagination that the reason remains unseduced, and we ask what it was all about, and what the men met for. They remind one of the preternatural manifestations that once took place in the neighbouring Cock-lane. What did the ghost want, and what did it knock for? We can understand a hundred ticket-of-leave men assembling to exchange expressions of sympathy, or to concoct a system of plunder, or to co-operate in a bloody revenge on the suspicious and unforgiving public, or to eat and drink together. But on this occasion they acted contrary to all policy and instinct. The proper game of a ticketof-leave man is not to show his ticket unless it is demanded by a policeman. He may, if he please, and if he is able, conceal his history from everybody about him. He may carry his ticket, together with a lock of his sweetheart's hair, nearest his heart; and he is encouraged to do so. But Mr. MfAyVirw invited the whole class to blazon their shame, and so deprive themselves of that protection whichl the law has mercifully given them. This was not a meeting of rats to bell the cat, but of cats to bell themselves. Some of the cats, indeed, appear to have been belied already, and to be rather proud of their noisy honours; but one of them only discovered himself for the first time on this occasion. A short, thin-faced, middleaged man, on the inspiration of the moment, told his sad tale, and his employer, happening to be present, heard -ith ecstatic delight that his faithful servant had once been a convict in Portsmouth Dockyard.
We may be stupid, but we don't see the joke of the affair. A fat, burly-looking young man, appropriately clad in a rough over-jacket and a wideawake, very abruptly stated his own view, which was that Mr. Ms.nmw was making capital out of them all, or " selling" them, as the phrase is. According to him, this ingenious gentleman merely gets them together in order to " suck their " brains" and maake up pretty stories for publication. The basis of this suggestion is, that Mr. MiYIEw does write articles and books about the class, describing their manner of life in rather alluring terms; and we presume he finds it worth his while to do so. On the other hand, it cannot possibly be worth a thief's while, or a ticket-ofleave man's while, to proclaim his calling and divulge its mysteries. But the fat, burly young man, made no allowance for the eccentricities of benevolence. It loves to possess a class and a realm of its own. The ancient thieves had a god of their own, whom they worshipped, and the medimval thieves had a peculiar saint under whose protection they placed themselves. So the rogues and ticket-of-leave men of modern London are invited to place themselves under the patronage of Mr. MAYHwmv. If he cannot better their condition in a very substantial sense he will at least invest it with the interest of romance. At his zummons a distinguished member of the Peerage condescends to hear the short and simple annals of the rogue, and enforce the old lesson that honesty is the best policy. Mr. MAZHnw inaugurates a grand reconciliation of classes, in which he is the central figiure. There are those who think that much good is done in a quiet way, that there are kindnesses which require special tact, and among them not the last is that office of charity which is concerned with halfrepentant offenders. They are not innocent; they are not quite to be trusted; yet neither ought they to be treated as if they were hopeless. They are just the people with regard to whom the left hand should not know what the right hand is doing. Mr. MAYHXw is of a different opinion. He invites all London to observe how entirely he can pardon a rogue, and how little doubt he has of the rogue's reformation, with adequate induicement. Mr. CARLYLP used to say of a well-known philanthropist that he ought to be the first Chairman of the Heaven and Hell Amalgamation Society. With the report before us, we think we could name his successor.
Like many another affair, it breaks down under the attempt to reason upon it. There are several thousand ticket-of-leave men in the kingdom, and there are many, many thousand, who are at large, after the commission of offences more or less serious. Yet Mr. MayHrw and his noble friend could not muster more than about 80 or 90 hearers. Some of this number, too, were old speakers, who have told their story till people are tired of hearinig it. Some were members of the swell-mob; at least, so it was concluded from a description which would place half the young gentlemen of tho Westend under suspicion. As it is taken for granted these men are still at their own trade, they had no right to be present. All that the meeting came to, then, is this,-that, myay be, fifty or sixty men, if so many, are ready to promise amendment, and wish to obtain good situations. This is bilt a trivial result. It is true there were some benevolent gentlemen present who were ready to receive back the penitent convicts to the bosom of society by giving, thlem work, but they showed little wisdom in doing this publicly. For our part, we would never advise any one to select for a confidential situation a mair of whom he knew only that he had committed crimes,-and was not ashamied to avow them. If a philanthropic gentleman is perfectly sure of being able to watch his servant, and thinks he can discern signs-f
I goodness and honesty in a convict inui8ible to t others, he is doing a great service to apoor, feUow
'in giving him another trial, ad: iust'be '¢ontii e ... ti
26e6a benefactor to" socfee. But any ordinary empoyei isahy -of 'uch Quixotism, and prefers making his establishment, whether domestic or mercantile, as naar an approach to a little Paradise as circumstances wil allow. He does not go out of his way to people his own little sphere with crime, even under the form of obtrusive repentance. When a kindness is to be done there is no lack of deserving objects, and they have at least as good a right to be tried as the undeserving. Of course, these remarks apply only to the sort of ticket-of-leave market, or Registry of Reformed Rogues, opened by Mr. M1YHEnw. It seems contrary to the very object of this measure, and to the idea of a ticket of leave. That idea, as we understand it-and we wish it all possible success, -is that a convict may have the opportunity of quietly melting into the labour-rmarket and bave a fresk start, not as a known offender, but as a supr7osed honest man. Iu this capacity we trust that thousands may be restored to their lost position, and so be never heard of again in their criminal relations.

The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER has not the
The CHAENCELLOR of the EXCHEEQuER has not the
adnmirable art and dexterity in the management of deputations that Sir ROBERT PEEL had. Sir ROBERT PEEL delighted in deputations, he looked on them as convenient machines for drawing out his own conclusions, and placing them in the most favourable light before the public. He knew exactly what a deputation was, how much it knew of the subject on which it came to speak, what its sources of information, its point of view, and its prevailing feeling were; he could measure it and weigh it almost before a single man spoke, and he knew his 'vantage-ground, and used it. A deputation comes full of its own side of the question, and often having hardly once confronted fairly the other side. A number of persons of the same class and interests talk among themselves, brood upon a grievance, sympathize with each other, agree entirely together, and endorse each other's arguments almost before they have heard them. It is the luxury of reasoning, without the ordeal of mutual criticism or calling to account; one is ready immediately to grant what the other says. Out of tlhis comfortable sphere of mutual approbation and harmony they suddenly emerge into contact with a hard head that, disguising its antagonism under a velvety surface, brings the other side of the question before them under shapes in which they do not know it, and extracts the most damaging admissions from them. The antagonist meets them round a corner in the form of some consequence or collateral point, which appears at firat sufficiently safe and irrelevant, and is not identified with the main position or recognized as the enemy. UInder this disguise the hostile truth, so far from meeting a bad reception, is sometimes welcomed and patted; the deputation play with it much to their satisfaction, and are drawn from one step to another. Then in a moment the blow of identification is struck by the man in office, and the deputation have nothing to do but to see that they have been skilfully entrapped into a confession which they would never have made if openly proposed to them. Perhaps they do not much relish the discovery; the process is not to the taste of most people, who do not like a favourite grievance being suddenly extracted, like a tooth by a skilful dentist, without their knowing it. On the whole, however, the practice of deputations has not worked amiss. It is a good thing for people accustomed to brood upon a particular grievance, and to look at it only from their own point of view, "to be obliged to confront the other side of the question, and confront it vivd Toce in a literal discussion with an acute and able statesman, in which they are kept to the point and made to face aud reply to an argument against them which in a book or a newrspaper they would probably answer quite to their own satisfaction by a sneer or a shrug.
Wre do not intend all the above remarks to apply to the deputation that waited on the CnHACELLOR of the ExCHEQuRt on Tuesday on the subject of the Income-tax, because, as far as opposition to thiat tax is concerned, we agree with it. But we must make the observation, that the deputation seems to have gone very little way in examining its own grounds of opposition to the tax, and that the CHANCELLo. of the ExcEEQuxu,6 though not endowed with his great official predecessor's consummate art and oily suavity in the treatment of deputations, yet contrived to bring out this fact rather clearly. It is certainly the last feather which breaks the horse's back; but the deputation do not seem to have at all made up their minds beforehand whether the Income-tax was the heavy tax it was from any weight of its owvn, or simply because there was so much more taxation besides it. This makes a great difference -if not all the difference-in our estimate of the tax; and yet when Mr. GANNON, one of the spokesmen of the deputation, is asked by the
CHlAcELLpOR of the EXC HIEQUEZR why he tlhinks the
Income-tax so heavy, his reply is that the Incometax is exceedingly heavy because there is a heavy tax on tea, and because there are heavy local rates. This gentleman describes the life of the small shopkeeper as a continual struggle, in which he is probably but too correct, and he thinks the Income-tax tels so very hardly apon him because he is obliged to pay so much to the exciseman, the parish, and the borougb, before he is asked for his Income-tax. But tllis is not properly the fault of the Income-tax, but the fault of the previous taxes. This deputation appears, in short, to come with a complaint against our system of taxation altogether, which it thinks grinding and oppressive; but it throws no light whatever on the question of relief. MIr. GANNON thinks it is our indirect taxation which is so ruinous. He calculates his indirect taxes at 201., and then asks how a small shopkeeper can go on under such a prcssure as this, besides the local taxes and the Income-tax? But the CHANcLIon of the ExCkiEQu'R naturally reminds hin that " taxation " must be either direct or indirect ;" that if you reduce indirect taxation you must increase direct; and that if Mr. GANNON therefore warts all indirect taxation to be abolished he is arguing for an Income-tax, and not agaiust it. Dr. (HALLieC, on the other hand; another ,pokes:uan, argues against any increase of the Income-tax, admitting, in answer to a question of the CHANELLOn, of the RxcnQUEll, that it is the amount of the tax which has caused the present agitation. Thus, the deputation argues one way or another according to the questions that the CHAONXLcoB, of the EXCHEQL.;P happens to ask. Dr. CHALLiCE argues against diaect taxation, Mr. GAwwox against indirect. The CHANCELLOR of the ExCHEQUER takes advantage of the general confusion to impress the simple truth that there rmust be taxes of some kind or other, and to remind the deputation that if they choose to live upon very plain food they may, after all, escape a great deal of this odious pressure. "There is no "tax on bread or biscuit, on meat, salt or dry, "fish, salt or dry, native fruit or vegetables " - rather a dry and unattractive dietary prospect to lay before a liuiaber of gentlemen 'who had come to solicit relief and consolation amid the hardslips of life. But oUr'Cacenrjs of the ExCHEQuER inherit a certain disciplinarian tone and function with their office. They are moralists as wall as financiers, they are did4ctic in their own depart-
mneit andateachl the prudential virtues; they have thei t pulpt as well ca their tieasury. Latepto
theml, and you will hesrWmanyrave and wholesome truths of economy and ulrcon#trol. They do not take your money withoutan appropriate comment -a word iat season-meant to-do you good; they are the national preceptors, iid they preach with the aid of proverbs and wi3e' sentences. Sir BOBEBT PEEL, when people complainied oftje fint impo3ition of the Income-tax, said they 'w -
find it a good check upon them; the classes I of society "were treading too much on one
" another's heels." Sir COnNEwALL LWaIs tells the gentlemen who come to him to complain of being overtaxed that they may live more sumply.
Here is a good, solid, nourishing food for you, gentlemen, not one morsel of which is taxed; "be content with this bill of fare; it is not herm4it's "diet, though it wants, perhaps, the seasoning "and stimulus to which you have been accus"tomed. You will have better health, and you "will pay nothing to me for it." So when the deputation-consisting, we presume, mainly of married men-liberally recommend Sir GEORGE COx%VALL LEwLS " to tax the bachelors" and gentlemen who live at clubs, his reply is equally didactic and monitory,-" I am afraid a C bachelor tax might operate as a constant in" centive to imprudent marriages."

In the Consolidated Court yesterday the caso of "Bergin v. M'Dowell" came before Mr. Justice Moore and a common jury. It was a record on a writ of fieri facias, founded on the judgment in this cause obtained on the 2d of June, 1856, against the official manager of the Tipperary Bank, for 4601. The writ was directed to Mr. John Scully, being resident magistrate. He had pleaded that he was not a shareholder. On this plea issue was taken and the question now came on to be tried before a ury-namely, whether Mr. Scully was a shareolder. The cotmsel for Mr. Scully contended that his client had not been an original shareholder, that the transfer to him was invalid, and read a transfer from James Scully to John Scully of 58 shares, which he contended was illegal, as it had not been registered at the Stamp-office. The handwviting of James ScuUy to the transfer was proved by M\r. Rodolph Scully, solicitor.
His LJordship held that there was evidence to go to the jury that MIr. Scullly was a shareholder.
The jur-y found a verdict for the plaintiff, that ir. Scully was a shareholder.

"Sir,-My attention having been called to a paragraph in the 11"cWy Dispatch, I immediately, to my almost overpowering surprise, recognized the case of my own brother under the head of ' Another Police Tragedy.' My motive for addressing you is this, to thank you sincerely for the inte. resttaLenin the oidow'sbehalf; nad in the nextplace to add my testimony to the truth detailed therein, for it was I that had an interview with the town-clerk of Coventry, it was I that sought the interview and pleaded ray brother's innocence before the magistrate, Mr. Trafford; it was I that visited him in prison and at Dr. Paul's ; I was present with my sister in the bereavement of her chUdren; and, finally, saw the earth cover their mortal remains. Therefore, I can most assuredly testify to the facts stated in the papers. r trust this wiU be sufficient apology for my addressing you, as strangers to each other; but my feelings would not permit me to remain silent. Should you happen to see Mrs. John Temnple she will confirm what I stated. She, indeed, accompanied me, but her broken spirit set the seal of silence on her lips. Since that period of time I have lost sight of my sister in-law. The mutability of things pertaining to worldly matters has passed rapidly over my path; therefore I live in great humbleness, and nearly all intercourse vith my family has ceasod. Bun should I not be taking too great a liberty and intruding too much on your time, I should much like to have her address; and, although I am not in a position to subscribe to her immediate wants, still I hope I have a heart that can sympa. thize with the widow and the fatherless. I pray God that Bis blessing may rest unon you, and t'hat the hearts of some benevolent persons may be touched with sympathy, and that your touching appeal may be responded to. In gratitude I subscribe myself, Your obedient servant,

The Double Murder In Walworth.
ITEE DOUBLE MURDER IN WXALWORTH.
Yesterday having been appointed for the further examinsation of Bacon and his wife, Lambeth PoUce Court was literally crammed by 1 o'clock, and during the investigation the greatest possible inconvenience w:s experiernced in Setting the necessary witnesses in and out of court.
At a quarter to 2 o'clork Bacon was led into conrt by.- Cook, the gaoler, and placed in the felons' dock. All eyes 'Were instantly fixed upon him, and he seemed not only to -shrink from their gaze but quail before the unmistakeable teeling which pervaded the mind of every one pre~sent, and which was given expression to by a deep and -solemn murmur. He at once went to the extreme end -and corner of the dock, where he sat dowsn, aud by turning "towards the Bench avoided the observations of the larger -crowd in the body of the court. Mrs. Bacon was soon after brought into court, and was permitted to sit at the solicitors' table, with her back turned to her husband, so t'nat during the examination he was unable to get a view of her countenance-a position she very much wished herself to OCCUpy, as sbe has expressed the strongest antipathy that her eyes should meet those of her husband. She -in much altered in appearance from the first time she was crharged at this court. That vacant stare which strongly indicated insanity has given way to one of a different cha-. racter-that of care, grief, and anxiety. In manner and -conduct, however, she seems perfectly sane and rationaL
Mr.Woodward, as on the former examinations, attended; but as the position of advocate for both Bacon and his wife -appeared, under the circumstances, to be somewhat antagonistic, the learned gentleman declared himself as attendinig -as the town agent of Mr. Atter, a solicitor of Stamford who has been attorney to the family, to be in attendance eor Bacon.
'Mhe first witness called was Mrs. Ann Hyde, who said,I am a widow, and live at No. 19, Fouracre-street, Walworth. On Tuesday, a week after the children were found dead, I was called im by Mrs. Payne to go to tho prisoner's house to sit up with those who were there-MIrs. Payne, Mrs. Mhonroe, her daughter, and the male prisoner, Bacon. On. the Wednesday following 1 did somiie washing there ; I washed sLx or seven shirts which Mrs. Payne gave me.
Mr. ELLIOTT.-Did you observe anything particular about these shirts, or any of them?
Witness.-Yes, Sir ; I saw a little blood on one of them, -on the front flap, on the outside. I mentioned it to Bacon, -and he said he wvas subject to bleeding piles; bnt I told him it was no such thing, having some experience from having ieen a nurse, and I am quite sure it had not been caused -by such a coll]plaint.
lr. ELLooTr.-Describe what it was like ?
Witness.-It was a smear, as if it had been rubbed with the hand, bht bad no mnarks of fingers. There was also a mark of blood en the right wristband. It was a snaaU speck just at the edge of the wristband. I noticed that Bacon appeered dreadfully nervous and timid, and I a.ked him what made him so, but he made no reply. He appeared unbappy, and often spoke about the death of his children, saying it was a bad job. He said he hoped his wife would not get punished, but would get home to hitn again, as he was sure she had not done it, and that somebody had, got into the house.
Mr. ELLIOTT.-Did he say how he thought they got into the house?
Witness.-Yes ; he said somebody had got in at the street door. I used-to eay to him that it was a shocking thing, and that if there was anything wrong I hoped he would speak the truth about it.
Mr. ELLos'T.- Why did you say all this?
Witness.-Because I had my doubts; the manwas so very nervous and tuid. He told me that on one occasion there was a key put into his s'reet-door lock, and on his going to -the door there was no one there. I stil had my doubts, and told Bacon two or three times that he had better tell the truth. I also told him that I did not think his wife had done such a thing, and I thought as I had been frightened two or three times in coming from my work that some ono had got in and did it.
Mlr. ELLIOTT.-Have you ever told the prisoner you -thought he did it?
Witness-?io, Sir, never.
MIr. ELLIOTT.-Did he say anything to you about his wife ?
Witness.-Yes; ho said that if his wife said anything about him hli would kill her.
Mr. ELLIoTr.-Do you recolleet what led to his saying so ?
Witness.-I think I was saying what a shocking thing it was, and then he said that if she said anything about hini le would kill her. I then said, "She won't lay it to you, or anytbing of that sort, will she 5" and then he repeated that if she did he would kill her. Mrs. Monroe and a little girl vwere present at this conversation, but I can't say whether they heard it or not. I recollect seeing a pair of trousers, fustian or moleskin, in the front room upstairs. I saw a small spot of blood on them, on the right leg at the bottom. I said nothing to anybody about it. When I saw it I did not speak to Bacon about it. I have seen the trousers to-day, and there is no spot at all now where I saw the blood, and it looks to me as if it had been taken out. Bacon never told nme how the blood caine "'ere, except as I have mentioned. I recollect he mentioned that he had a sore finger from cutting it; I think he said it was done carving at dinner. I don't recollect his giving any other account of it.
Mlr. ELuorTr.-Do you recollect his s2aying anything else about his wife?
Witaess.-Yes; I think he said that if she returned home to bins he should take her abroad.
Mr. Atter, o' Stamford, Bacon's attorney, here eatered
the court, and h.s presence seemed to inspire his client with I mucheonfidence. Bacon, whohadappeareduptothispointin a drooping and dei-cted state, seemed to pluck up a good deal, ,and as soon as Mu r. Atter tookhis seat by the side of Mr.Woodward, he (B4con) commenced writing a note, which lie forwarded to him, and received one in reply.
Mrs. Matilda Laurence, of No. 11, George-street, Camber'well, was next called, and deposed that on the morning of 3Ionday, the 5th inst., she sent her daupghter, a child of 8 years of age, on an errand, and in about five minutes she returned with the watch produced wrapped up in a piece of paper, and said bhe had picked it up on the step of the door,
o. 4, George-street.
Mr. ELLI(7T. -What sort of paper was it ?
Witness.- A piece of paner which appeared to me to be part of a posting bill, t,ut 1 took no particular notice of it, but threw it away. I kept the watch until the Saturday following, when I pawned it at the shop of Mr. Wharton, in the walworth-road. I redeemed it afterwards and handed it to Mr. Davies, now present,
An intelligent little girl, the child of the last witness, corroborated her statement as to finding the watch.
Mr. Richard Davies, an ex-officer of the police, deposed that on the 210th inst. he rectived the watch produced from Mrs. Lawrence, and that on the same evening he saw the prisoner Bacon at the shop of Mr. Penson, ironmonger, in the Walworth-road. He asked him to describe the 'Watch he had lost, and for the restoration of which he had -offered a reward of 5i, and he said that it had been made by his brother, and its number was the same as that mentioned in the bill. He then showed the watch to Bacon, and on looking at he said he did not believe it was his, but subsequenitly he thought it was. Witness at that time gave up the watch to Sergeant Broad. Davies, in reply to a question fronm the magietrate, said he knew the neighbour. hood well, and the distance from the bouse in Fouracre. street, from wvhich Bacon alleged the watch had been taken, to that in George-street where it was found, was about a- quaiter of a mile-fully that.
Mr. Richard Tronnce, a coffee-housekeeper, in Commercial-place, City-road, said,-The prisoner Bacon came to my house on Sunday, the 4th inst., for the first time and took a bed for the night, requesting that he might be called at 6 o'clock in thenornlng. He was called, and I let him out, and he said ho was going by the King's-cross Raiway. He returned again about half-past 7 o'clock, and said he was about two minutes too late for the train. Be was away altogether "hout an hour and a-half.
Dr. Bushell, called and sworn, said,-I have examined a pair of fustian or moleskin trousers sho.vn to me by Inspector Young, and I found upon them several spots which have the appearance of blood on both legs in the front. They are partly obliterated, but they have still the appearance of blood. I have also examined a waistcoat (pr,-duced), and find a spot of bleod in the fall from the coUar in front. That waistcoat I saw on the bed in the house in Fouracre-street, when I was first -oalled in, with a coat of a similar texture. The trousers were not there at that time. I think the blood which I saw on the lower part of Mrs. Bacon's dress did not come from her throat. I thi,k that blood had spurted from something against it. That blood would not have come from the chil
dren lying on the ground. It nmight have come from the elder child, the boy, if the person had been standing in the front or at the side of himn. The wound in the throat of Mrs. Bacon was not very deep; she might have lost three or four ounces of blood, and I think losing that quantity

The Income-Tax.
THE I.NCOME-T AX.
MARYLEBONV.
"asc evoenng a public meeting of the ratepayers of Marv. lebone was held in the Court-house, for the purpose of desnarding an abolition of the income-tax. Sir James John Hamliton, Badt., the Crown churchiwarden, was called to the chair, and not only the body of the Courthouse, but the galleries and lobbies were crowded in every pgart.
The Ci ncn.er briefly opened the proceedings, and read the followinlg letter from Sir C. B. HaIjl:-
'Llanover, Jan. 27.
*Sr,-I beg to acEnowledge the receipt of Mr. NicholWy's letter, which reached me here thls day, requeeting my attendances at a public meeting tobe held to-merrow evening for the purpose of consldering the propriety of petitioning Paraiament and adopting such other means as mroy be considered necessary for the repeal of the actsa which increased the property and income-tax from 7d. to Is. 4d. in the pous.d, aud for obtaining a more equitable adjustment, or a total repeal of the tax up,n trsdes and profes ions. I desire to express my regret that it will be impossible for me to leave Wales during the very short period that muist elap3e previous to the meetinz of Par. liament on Tuesday next, when I shall be in Tordon. As regards the income and property tar, the additional tax of 9d. in the pound vas sauctioned by Parliament Sor special objects, and wad interded to coa e so soon as those objects were attained, and although as the act is drawn the tax Is continued till April, l853, the public Wil have been Informed by the declaration of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Friday last that it never was the intention of the Government to take advantage of the wording of the act, or to adopt a course which wowuld be contrary to the real obiect for which the act was^ pbsass With reference to the remainder of the tax of 7d. in the pounds, i loie always er-res.eed a hose that a more equitable adjust
euet of the tax may to devised, and it willi alo,d me the greatest pleanueto rLecord my 'rote in favour of any scheme vwhich shea insure the accomplishment of Clint object.
*-I airs, Sir, yours faithfnUly,
"To theChalrman of theo leeting." . HAL
The Chairman said there were also letters from other members of Parlianient and gentlemen in favour of the objects of the nueetiug.
Mr. N'ICLOLAY said he was there to denounce the conteinplaited trickery of the Government with regard to this nrost infamnous and inquisitorial income-tax, but it was with still more pain, surprise, and regret that he had heard the letter which bad just been read from Sir B. HalL (aear, bear.) Instead of a bold and open avowal of his sentiments by the ftrmer Liberal member for Marylebone, they had in this letter the Jesuitical emanation of a Minister of the Crown. (Hear, hear.) He re-echoed the sentiments of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which told 'he country that lie intended to do absolutelv nothing. He would tell the imeinber for Marylebone, and lie would tell the Govern. mnent, that the country demanded the removal of this ta, and that they weredetermined to have itremoved (cheers)aye, and they would have it offfrom the 5th of April next. (Applause.) He begged to move the first resolution,-
"That. inasmuch as S& in the pound otthe present tax upon propeyty and incomc3 w7es impo-s d for the purpoees of the late war, with aditinctnunderstandingtbatwiththetermination of hostilities such additisnal impon should also cease, this meeting in of opinion that the inmiediete a'aslition of the var 9d becomes a solemuobli6atio onthe Part of Her Majesty's Government."!'gain o h (Loud applause.)
1lr. WHIDTIORE seconded the resolution.
'Mr. J. BELL, M.P., said an attempt would be made by the G overnment to embarrass members of Parliament, either by declaring the necessity of the tax in consequence of the Persian and Chicese wars, or that if taken off it would retard the principles of free trade. He was sure the country would never submit to that. (Applause.)
The resolution was carried unanimously, amid loud applause.
Mr. JACOB BELL moved the second resolution,-
.- That the income and property tax as at present levied, being up. just in prinucile, inqukitorial in character, and especially oppressve to persons of hiuted Incomes, requires great and important modifcations befure it can be renuered acceptable to the taxpaying communityY,
Mr. Bell, amid loud and repeated applause, denounced the continuance of the tax, and showed that it wan unjust, as well as obroxious in priinciple.
Lr. P. GRATAIM seconded the resolution.
Mr. BEAcoN said the tax ought to be levied on the landed proprietors of the kingdom, and not on the trading and industrious classes.
Mr. C. FEETiri said the tax was fraudulent in its introduction, as well as inquisitorial and oppressive in character.
The resolution was carried unanimougy, amid continued
TPhemeeting also resolved that a petition should be presented to the House of Commons, embodying the spirit of the resolutions.
LAMBETH.
Last evening a meeting of the inbabitants of the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth, was held in the Vestry-hall, Kenninoton-road, to take into consideration the propriety of petitioning for an immediate repeal or modification of the pre. sent incomne-tax, especially as regards its injutious effects on persons with small incomes. Mr. J. W. Stratton occupied the cbair.
.Mr. KNIGHT, after describing the great injustice of the continuance of the income-tax, proposed the following resolution:-
"That, in conseqnence of the heavy exnen.ea Incurred in the main. tenance and educatien of a family, and the greit amount of indirect tax ationi to whicih al are lialle, this meeting is decidedly of opinon that the present Income-tax eanot he imposed upon persons whose incomues ao not exceed J 51) per annum without great cruelty and in. justice.,
Mr. lUNDE-RWooD seconded the resolution.
Mir. W. WILLIAMIS, M P., who on rising was greeted by load cheers, said he had very recently expressed his opinion of the income-tax in the strongest terms. ie agreed entirely with the resolution, but he went further. When the tax was lowered from 1501. to 1001. he opposed it to the utmost (cheers), and told the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it would reach the best classes of mechanics and labouriag men. The Chancellor said he did not wish the tas to press upon those classes, but he (Mr. Williams) reminded hin that when the law was passed those who were intrusted to administer it would do so to the very letter. It had affected the smaU tradesmen, and it was grossly unjust that the mechanic, those in trade, and the poor professional man should have to pay at the same rate as the great landowner or rich fundholder. All that class had to do was to receivo an account from their stewards, but the professional man, or tradesman or mechanic, was in a constant state of anxiety, having to labour hard for his slender income. When the subject came before the House of Commons he would bring forward a motion to carry out the sentiments of the resolution and divide the House upon it, so they would soon see who was for it and who was against it. (Loud cheers.) The people ured their membersto endeavour to repeal this ard that tax, but they did not pay mfficdent attention to the expenditure of the money. They were ruled by the aristocracy, for the aristocracy had the House of Lords all to themselves, and either they or their creatures had a majority in the House of Commons also. (Hear, hear.) AllUthey had to do was to presshard upon the representatives of the people, one of whom he himself was, and he was as proud of the title as any aristocrat was of his order. (Cheers.) The hon. member concluded by describing the immense sums of money that would be expended it the schemses for building new public offices and removing the National Gallery to Kensington were carried out, and again pledging the meeting that he would perseverdei inendeavounrng to attain the important object they
After some ireinarcs from Mr. WINTL?? , a working man, who stated that he went to Horsemonger-lane Gaol because he would not pay the tax, the original resolution was carried unanimoualy, amid loud cheers.
It was then nioved by Mr. LowniX, and seconded by Dr. PURCELL,

Mr. STEPviE';soe, a working man, seconded the mot on, which was agreed to.
A petition embodying the foregoine resolutions was adopted, and the proceedings closed with votes of thanks to Mr. W. Williams, MP., and the chairman.
DERBY.
A numerous public meeting of the inhabitants of Derby was held on Tuesday; the Mayor, Mr. F. Gisborne, pre. sided, and there was an influential gathering of the tradesmen of the town.
Mr. Councillor BATES moved the first resolution, which advocated the repeal of the additional tax from the 5th of April next.
Mr. Councillor SHAW seconded it, and it was carried.
Mr. Alderman Moss moved the second resolution, which was^seconded by Mr. BAKER, to the effect that the present system of levying the income-tax by taxing precarious and permanent incomes alike is manifestly unjust; that the despotic and inquisitorial mode of assessment is repugnant to the feelings of Englishmen, and has only been submitted to from time to tino under the impression that the tax was for a temporary purpose; and that In the opinion of the meeting a more equitable adjustment of the tax and an improvement in the mode of assessment ought to be made. A petition founded upon the resolutions was adopted.
A letter was read from Sir. L. Heywortl, Mf.P., advocatsag a reduction in the tax a;nd the adoption of indirect for direct taxation, ^and he also contended that the repeal of the Customs' duties would SeCUre for us the amity of the
Mr. BASS, XMP., addressed the meetins, advocating direot taxation as far as practicable. He did not wish it to be thought that he wae prepared to go to Parliament to v'ote

CHESTERPIELD,
Yesterday a meeting of the inhabitants of Chesterfield was held in the suniiipal.hall for the purpoce of petitioning the Government on the subiect of the repeal, of the income-tax. The Mayor, Mr. W. Drabble, occupied the chair, end the meeting was attended by the prindipal tradesmen of the town.

EDIN'BURGH.
At the meeting of the Edinbu rh Town-Council on Tuesday Councillor itlACKLAY introduced a motion to the effect that the property and income tax was excessve, and ought to be immediately reduced to the original amount of 7d. in the pound; and tha t the tax onght to be aboished on all incomes of 1501. and under, as heing oppressive and
iaie CLARK proposed an amendment to the effect that the income-tax was excessive, and ought to be immediately reduced to the lowest posaible rate which the requirements of the country will bear.
Bailie BROwiN DOUGLAS said, he could not agree to Mr. Mackinlay's motion, which proposed to do away with nine milnions of revenue without any proof that the country was able to bear it, and at the same time to contnue those fiscal reductions for which the tax was imposed.
Councillor RUSSELL nmoved the previous question, preferring that, if necessary, the tax should be continued for another year, with all its inequalities, rather than endanger tohe principle of free trade, and the reductions, accomplished or promised, on tea, coffee, sugar, and other neces-
The LORD PROVOST said, he would also support the previous question, on the ground that, as the estimates of the revenue and expenditure were not before them, they could not decide upon what amount or description of the country's taxes it wonld be expedient to reduce.
After some discussion, in which several members objected to petitioning for the exemption of small incomes,
Councillor I.&c}uiNLAY altered his motion to the effect of petitioning Parliament to reduce the tan to the sum fixedby the act of 1853.
The vote was then taken, vhen the previous question was lost by 19 to 9; Bailie Clark's amendment was lost by 24 to 5; and the motion of Councillor Mackinlay, as amended, was carried by 17 to 10.

Share Dealing By Directors.
SHARE DEALING BY DIBECTORS.
TO TEE EDITOR OF THE THE TIMES.
Sir,-As a shareholder in many and a director in several oint-stock companies in one of our most flourishing colonies, I have watched with deep interest the proceedings in the cases of gigantic fraud on railway and other companies which have. lately been made public, and there is one fact whiclh has transpired respecting which I shall be glad of your permission to say a few words.
It appears to have been admitted that at least three of the directors of the Great Northern Railway Company hold shares in the names of other persons, whether real or fictitions does not seem to be quite certain. Not only is this adnitted, but it appears that the practice is justified by the suggestion that it might create alarm if directors of a company were known to be selling their stock. In other words, these false accounts are kept to enable the directors to traffid in shares, through the agency of a broker, without bein known
I shall be glad to know whether this practice is general, and also to be informed, by some of the many able persons who enlighten the public on commercial affairs through your columns, whether it is recognized in the monetary circles as a correct one ?
To me it appears pregnant with the greatest danger, and I have always understood that a director of a comipany who should traffic in shares would be highly culpable.
Either in buying or selling he has information which the person he contracts with cannot have. If he knows of anything advantageous to the com pany and likely to raise the price of shares, is it right that he should take advantage of mis brother shareholder, whose representative he is, and buy from him for 101. that which he knows will be worth 131. or 141. next week t Or, if he knows of bad debts or other causes which are likely to depreciate the value of stock, can his disposing of his shares to a person who cannot by any
Psbili obtain the same information be justified? AnZ, astly, and most important of all, will not directors who speculate in shares be always considering the effect of these sneassres on the price of stock instoad of the general and permanent interests of the comPanV?

Sir,-In conseqnence of a paragraph in 21le Times of Saturday, January 24, with regard to the case of William Tabner, overlooker in the mill of Booth, Leigh, and Co., at Patricroft, we have to state most distinctly that no violence of any description has been used to any of our hands by auy overlooker, manager, or other person whomsoever with our knowledge, nor have we received any complaints of any such violence before the present time.
The miU has been erected "'oaut 25 ears, and worked by us the greater part of the time. We employ about 1,100 persons, and the only summonses which Mr. Trafford has grante4 have been against workpeople for leaving our em loynient without notice.
William Tabnor has been in our service about 11 months, and we had a most excellent character with him. We have, however, thought it right, without wishing in any way to prejudice this case, to suspend him until the present charges have been fully inquired, mto.
In conclusion, we deny that any person has been absent in consequence of ill-treatment.

The Murderer, Thomas Mansell.-This pri-
THE MURDERER, Twozus XANsE.-This prisoner, who was a private in the 49th Regiment, and who, it will be remembered, was convicted before Mr. Baron Bramwell, at the late winter assizes for the county of Kent, of the murder of Alexander M'Burnie, a corporal in the same regiment, by deliberately shooting him through the body with a rifle, still remains in Maidstone gaol under sentence of death. The prisoner was originally ordered for execution on the 1st of January, the same day on which Dedea Redanies suffered for the murder of his sweetheart at Dover, but the execntion was respited on account of the AttorneyGeneral having granted a writ of error upon au objection taken by MIr. Russell, the counsel assigned to the prisoner, that the jury who tried the case were improperly empanelled, and that the trial, therefore, was not aIlegal one. The circumstances under which the writ of error has been granted are of a rather peculiar character. There was not the slightest doubt of the prisoner having commnitted the offence with which he was charte It was proved that he had repeatedly quarre'ded with the unhappy deceased, and that he (ore strong animosity against him on account of a supposition he entertained that when the reginment left the Crimea the deceased had dealt improperly with some article of clothing that belonged to nlm, and he was seen by two or three of his comrades to go close to the deceased, who had his back towards him, to level his rifle and discharge it at the unfortunate man, who instantly dropped down dead, Under these circumstances the counsel for the prisoner, who, by the way, was merely assigned by the Court for the defence, felt that the only chance that remained for the prisoner was to exercise his power of challenging the jury, so that it should be composed entirely of inhabitants of Maidstone, who, it appears, entertain strong objections to the infliction of capital punishment, and who a short time back were supposed to have acquitted a girl who was charged with murder, and agaiest whom the evidence was of tne most conelusive character, solelyuponthatground. Hethereforeoballenged to the fnU extent permitted by the law, and objected to 24 jurymen who were summoned from otber parts of the county, and it was on account of the counsel for the prosecution, Mr. Ribton, exercising a right that has always been carried out by the counsel for the Crown in such cases, of requiring the -Maidstone Jurors to "stand by," as it is ternmed, and going through the whole panel for the purpose of endeavouring to obtaii an indifferent jury, that an application was made to the Attorney-General for a writ of error. Mr. Baron Bramwell at the tinie of the trial expressed a strong opinin that there was nothing in the objection, and refused to reserve the point for farther consideration, at the same time teling Mr. Russell that he must toke his own course to obtain' a writ of error, and he should not interfere; and the law officers of the circuit, who have had very great experience in criminal matters, were also of of opinon that the proceedings under which the trial took place were perfectly legal, and in accordance with the p raetice of conducting criminal trials. The writ has just boen received by Mr. Straight, the deputy-clerk of assize on the Home Circuit, and he thereupon proceeded to make out a written statement of the facts, which he transmitted to the Court of Queen's Bench, and the next step that will be taken will be to have the matter argued before the judges of that court, and this -wil probably be done at the close of the present term, but no day has yet been fixed for the purpose. The execution of the prisoner, as above .stated, was originally ordered to take place on the 1st of gjanuary, buathe was tespited to the 5th of February. It is now, however, pretty clear that the writ of error cannot be disposed of by that day, and it will therefore be hecessary fo iend down anotber respite. It seems a rather extraordinary proceeding that the law should permit such a course-4 this upon a teochnical objection of uch a character, and it would appear that in the, event, which is not considered at all pro-
liable, of fir zr.,ges deciEing that the jury wAas not em-' pmnelled ke6brdne*to law tlietraalwouldbe merely declared. not terbexe bee a. 1eXai tei,ad h nrionr will be rb-

The Frauds On The City Banks.
THE FRA UDS ON TEB CITY BRAKS.-
Yesterday James Anderson and James Townsend Saward, who have undergone repeated examinations upon charges of extensive forgery and fraud upon London bankinghouses, were again brought before the LORD MAYOR, at the ManSion-house.
Mr. MUllens again attended on behalf of the pro ezution
Mrr. Giffard appeared for Saward; Anderson was not defended.
M3r. Wilson, clerk to Mr. Alfred Turner, solicitor, of Red Lion-square, said,-I know the convict Henry Atwell. In April, 1856, he caUed at our office and gave me instructions to write to a person named Hesp, for payment of an I 0 U to 10, Chlarinaton-street, Oakley-square. I wrote accordingly. The money was paid during my absence. On the 8th of May Atwell again caUed, and I handed him the amount of the I 0 U, Atwell did not give his real name; but the name of Hunter. He called again on the 19th of June, and gave me instructions to write for payment of an I 0 U for 103L. 15s. 6d. to a person named Hart, in Melton-street, Euston-equare. I accordingly wrote; and on the 21st of June a person called aud paid the amount Atwell again called on the 24th. A check was then given to him for 1031. 8s. 10d. Atwell signed, in the name of Hunter, the receipt now shown me.
Mr. Alfred TErner.-I keep an account with Messrs. Gosling and Company, the bankers. In the early part of March last I lost my pocket-book, which contained, I think, three or four blank checks upon Messrs. Gosling. I lost also a private letter in my pocket-book which had been addressed to me by a client at Oxford. The signature to the check now shown me for 4101. 7s. 4d., and signed "Alfred Turner," is not in my handwriting, but it is a very good imitation. The filling up of the check is an imitation of Mr. Wilson's writing.
Cross-examined by Mr. Giffard.-I had taken the checks from my check-book. I lost, perhaps, three or four checks in my pocket-book. I did not advertise for the pocket-book. I made an inquiry at a post-office respecting it, bat I did not say anything about the contents of it. Bet for the inquiry which arose about the forgery I should not have said anything about the checks. I might at first sight have mistaken the signature to the check for my own, but, upon looking at it closely, I should have dikcovered it to be a forgery.
Mrs. Elizabeth Shoolbrooke.-I live in Charringtoustreet, Oakley-square. In April last a person who gave the name of Hesp hired my front parlour. I believe the prisoner Anderson to be that person. He agreed to pay me 6s. a-week for the room. and made a deposit of is. at the time. He said he was going to Brighton, and would return on the Thursday following. He alEo said he would send his luggage, and asked me to take care of it. He took away two letters which had been sent to him there.
Mrs. Eliza Brewer-In June last I lived at 6, Meltonstreet, Euston-square, when the prisoner Anderson, who gave me the name of Hart, hired my front parlonr. He asked me to take care of any letters that mi-ht come addressed to him. He took away two letters that came by post.
M1r. Bushnell.-I am cashier to Messrs. Gosling and Company. On Saturday, the 28th of June last, the check for 4101. 7s. 4d. was presented to me for payment, and I paid it in eight 501.-notes and 101. 7s. 4d. in money. At the time the check was presented Hardwicke was in the bank, and interrupted me in paying it by patting a question to me.
W. Hardy.-In June last I advertised fora situation, and received a letter in answer to the advertisement, in consequence of which I went to 76, Albert-road, Regent's-park. It ere saw the prlsoner Anderson, who was passing by the name of Taylor. He engaged me as his servant, and sent me from the University Hotel, in Tottenham-court-road, to get cash for a check for 410L 7a. 4d., npon Messrs. Goslings' bank. I received the amount in eight 501.-notes, and the rest in cash, axd handed it to him.
Elizabeth Skates, barmaid at the John of Gaunt; Duke-
et, Lineoln's-inn-fields, said,-I know the pnrisoner Anderson, and have seen him at our house several times. He was in the habit of waiting in the parlour, and persons u.ed to come and see him. I have lent them pen and ink, besides serving them with drink. I do not recollect having seen SawaTd there.
Cross-examined by Mr. Giffard.-I might have seea the people of whom I speak five or six times in the parlour.
S. Cole said, I was formerly barman to Mr. Wimbush, who keeps the Magpie publichouse. in Bishopsgate. On a Saturday in August haSt I caUed Mr. Wimbush's attention to a "Rent " who had been sitting in the parlour the greater part of the day. While Mr. Wimbush was gone to the bank for change two persons kept going in and out of the house. The person who was sitting inthe parloer is the prisoner Saward. I had seen him before then, but not to know him.
Cross-exam ined by Mr. Giffard.-When Mr. Wimbush returned he asked me who was in the parlour, and I told him there was an old " gent " there whro had been sitting there ever since he had been out.
Mr. Gifrard.-How do you know that this occurred on a Saturday?
Witncss.-Becauce MIr. Wimbush was in the habit of going to the bank for change for his customers on a Saturday, and I saw him take the bag with him in which he used to bring home the change.
Mr. Wimbush.-I am landlord of the Magpie?,ublichouse. I saw a man whom I believe to be Saward, although I will not swear to him, in my house on Saturday, the 16th of August last.
Cross-examined by Mr. Giffard.-The man, whoever he was, sat in a dark corner, and it was a difficult matter to dicern his exact features. I think I had seen him on previous occasions at the bar.
- Mr. G. Baum, cashier to Messrs.

Richard Saunders.-I am porter at Gregory's Hotel, Cheapside. On the 18th of August last a gentleman, who, to the best of my belief, was the prisoner Anderson, came to the hoteL He first sent me for a Braduhai's Guide. He afterwards sent me with a check for 1001., which I believe to be the one produced, to Messrs. Hankey's to get cash for. The cheek was not paid.
Mrs. Margaret Hardwicke, a very respectably-attired elderly person, was next sworn, and said,-I am the wife of William Salt Hardwicke. I hsve known Saward about 12 years. He has been acquainted with my husband during that period. In 1S44 I left Van Diemen's-land and came over to this country. We then went to live at Mr. Friar's, in Wellington-street, Goswell-street. We remained there 13 months. During that time Saward frequently visited us. In 184S we aain came to England from Van Diemen's-land, and remained here til 1850. I lived in Jewin-crescent first, and afterwards in Angel-street, Aldersgate-atreet. From there I went to Wales, and afterwards went to live in Buckinghamstreet, New Kent-road. Saward caUed upon us in Jewincrescent and Angel-street and dined with us. We went to his house to a party while we were living in Buckinghamstreet. Hle at ,that time lived next door to the Hourglass, on Walworth-common. I then went back to the colonies, andareturned to this country in May last. I never saw Saward from 1850 till he was in custody.

salled and I gave itto him. I recollect Hardwicke's coming to England again and living, in Jewia-crescent. I visited them And upon one occasion sawr Saward there. It w;as Mrs. Hardwicke'.s birthday. Saward's daughters were also there, and he came and fetched them home in the evening.
Elizabeth Dixon.-Hardwicke is my mother's nephew. I know the prisoner Saward as Mr. Sharp. He brought letters to my house for Hardwicke on two occasions. Isaw Saward on Saturday of the week in which the police had been to Nelson-square. He asked me If I had heard from Mr. Hardwicke. I told him that I had heard, and that the officers had been at the sqcjare. He seemed very much surprised. I asked him how it was that Hardwicke was detained down at Yarmouth. He replied, " There's nothing of any consequence there, that I know of, but there's no telling what it may lead to." lHe then said if any inquiries shoud be made at my house if I knew any friend of Mr. Hardwicke's I was to answer " No." He told me to say there were letters left at my house in the name of Sharp, but that a lady always called for them. He said, " I have sent a person down to Yarmouth to know wha; detained P4ardwcl;e, and I have directed him to your house." He added that he did not think that person would write, but that he should see him personally. I then gave him; two letters which had beea sent to me for Mr. Hardwicke.

I delivered to Saward two letters addressed to Mr. Ralph.
Mrs. 1ill.-Ilive atl3,1Union-terrace, Bagnigge-wells-road. In September last the prisoner Anderson hired a room of me for a friend of his, as he said, named Jones. Two letters came addressed to Mr. Jones, having the Yarmouth postmark upon them. (The witness iLdentified one of the letters.) Mr. Jones never came and occupied the room.

The prisoners were again remanded till to-morrovw (this

Representation Of Salford.-Mr. E. R. Lang-
RFPRES1EIiTATiox oF SALFOR-D.-Mr. E. R. Langwor thy, the candidate for the vacant seat, addressed the electors of Salford on Tuesday night. He declared himself a thorough Free-trader, and promised to support every measure that he believed vould p remote unrestricted industry and commerce in the tbrosaest senem of the words. He would do all in his power to secure economical administration of public funds, as far as was consistent with the efficiency of the pubic service, for he was to the utmost xtent, and most sincerely, an econtomist. He considered that the incomae-tax was an unfair tax, and had always thought as much, believing that tinder any circamstanees its inequalities ought to be remedied. Yet he preferred direct to indirect taxation. He could not concur with the viewvs of the Peace Society as regards the disbanding of our soldiers, and the dismantling of our fleets, nor could he vote for aa anti-liquor-traffic bill, as he believed that a legislative enactment was not the right step. Ho was an advocate for a very large extension of the suffrago, and he did not hold that propBrty was the proper test of fitness for the exercise of the franchise. It was one of the existing tests, and he belieived that others might be and ought to be applied. There 'were great numbers now excludedl who were compstent to exercise andl ought to bo put in pomession of the privilege of the franchise. A. question of nearly equal importance was the re-distribuationx of electoral districts, and he was an advocate for the ereaoval of the existing anomalies. He -was decidedly in favour of the ballot. Alir. Laugworthy their underwent a searching examination by the electors present, the'- hou. gen-. tleraii replying tha he didanot think" the union of Church and State beneficial to either Party;- that he would support the Factory Act; and that he would not vote against the Idaynooth grant (although opposed to all State endowments) because he -regarded Maynoollh as -&n exceptional case; He sawi no great objection to Sunday bands, but would acequiesce in the opinions of his constituenits. To the abolition of the ecclesiastical courts the hon. gentleman declamd himself 'decidedlly. favourable, A. voto of approval wAs passed, and ~themeeingdiserse.

The order is confined to the corps of Royal Artillery.
The night patrols of Artillery having been increasod by the addition of 100 picked men, under the charge of 12 extra sergeants, a strict watch throughout the most obscure parts of the town and the common is kept up from 4 o'clock p.m. until 6 a.m. on the following morning, so as to prevent a continuation of the scandalons ottrages which have been committed there by men in the uniform of the Royal Artillery.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-When the emigrant vessel, the Tayleur, was wrecked in 1854, near Dubln, L being then resident in that city, took the charge of a little boy who was saved, 'while both his parents were among the passengers who perished.
For this child many benevolent persons in both EnglandC and Ireland placed sums of money in my hands. The child, however, shortly after died, when part of the money was re,urned to the subscribers, while some of it was kindly left at my disposal. This sum I have held over until a case similar to the one for which it was raised should. present itself.
I shall therefore feel obUged if you will allow me tbrough yon to offer this balance of the ' Ocean Child Fand " (901.) for the permanent benefit of a cbild rendered an orphan by one of the disasters caused by the late gales.

Messrs. Fox, Henderson, And Co., And The
Mlssss. Fox, HENDDERSON, AND CO., AbND TRE DocrKs N.rPol.Zoe.-It may be remembered that at the bephming of December last an rction was brought before tue Tribtnal of Commerce against Mossrs. Fox, Henderson, and Co., the well-known Eoglish contractors, by the present direotors of the company of the Docks Napoleon, to obtain from them 4.000,000f. worth of shares in the company, orn the ground that the sailI sbares had been obtained by fraud, committed in conj anction with the late acting directorsand rox, Henderson, and Co., on their part, brought a counter action against the company for 2,000,000f. damages for non-fulfilment of agreement. Yesterday the Tribunal gave the following judgment in the case :-" With regafd to the principal demand, considering that Fox, Henderson, and Co., in treating in February, 1854, with Cusin, Legendre, and Duchfine de Vere for the construction of the Docks Napoleon for 24,000,000f., payable five-sixths inL specie and one-sixth in shares of the company, secretly tounnd themselves to remit to those directors a sum of 1,S00,OOOf. as commission; thWt it was at the same time understood between the parties that a subscription of 4,000,000F. worth of shares in the Docks Company, ostensibly made by Fox, Henderson, and Co., should not oblige them to pay any calls, and was only made to, facilitate obtaining from the competent authorities tho sanction of the bylaws of the company; considering that in July, 1854, a decree of sanction not having been obtained, the parties, under pretext of making some modif6oations in their first conditions, stipulated that 32,000 paid-up shares of 12Sf. each, which were to have formed the price of a sixth of the works, should be given to Fox, Henderson. and Co., sabject to the condition that those shares should belong to them, as compensation,, in case the company should daminish in any manner whatsoever the importance of the projected constructions; that at the same time Fox, Henderson, and Co. deliverf to Cusin, Legendre, and Orsi (the latter replacing Duchdne de Vere) 14,000 shares, or 1,800,000f., in payment of the commission stipulated for the advantage of the grantees of the docks; considering that if, according to the terms of the bylaws of thc 8oci6ti anonymc of the docks, even before they were
eanctioned, Cusin, Legendre, and Dach,no de Vero had the right to enter into anly contracts relative to the constructions to be undertaken, such contracts ought to have been made for the advantage of the persons whom they represented, and not for their own personal advantage; that Fox, Henderson, and Co. could not be ignorant that the 1,800,000!. which were demanded from them as commission,a were destined to profit solely the persons with wshom they contracted- and they neverthesless consented thereto on account ofthe price wihich was accorded to them for the works; and that Casin, Legendre, and Dunhtine de Vere did not discuss the price asked for those works in consequence of the position in which they stood towards the contractors; that it is consequently evident that in the conventions of the 14th of Fearuary, 1854, the interests of the shareholders were doubly sacri6ced by the fraudulent understanding (entetce fraudidcme) of all the parties; considering that if Fox, Hendersgn, and Co. pretend that the 32,000 shares, remitted to them in execution of the convention of July, 1854, were only the just remuneration of their expenses during the five mouths which had clapsed, they do not prove that they provided supplies of materials for the projected constractions, nor that they specially retained emoploys and workmen for the operation, which, beside.,, was only to be commenced ic the fortnight following the sanction of the bylaws; that it is piaved that, during that period, al the prties employed their efforts to obtain that result, and that it was only when they doubted of success that they imagtned the handing. over of the 32,000 shares, without compensation, in order to be therobv able to divide among themselves 4,000,000f. to the detriment of the shaveholders who confiding in tho enterprise had -invested their capital in it; that it is thus evident that tha conduct of Fox, Henderson, and Co. hasbeen, 1R all this &ffair, as blamable as that of Cusin, Legendre, and Orsi, and' that it is right, for the sake of public order, to declare Aull and of no effect the convention of the 14th of February 1854, aid khso that of the 24th of July foUowing; that the consequence which flows from this Is the restitution to the present directors of the docks of the 32,000 shares unduly received, or the payment of 4,000,000£, the value ascribe& to them;X anid with respect to the 'cuiitertactioniof 'oix Henderson, and Co., considering that from what pretedes it cannot be admitted; for these motives the tribunal declares null and void and of no effect, as stained with fraud .(s7Xcn7e dc. fraude), the conventions entered' into oni tlie, 14th of lFebruary and the 9Ath of July, 185, between Po4, Hrenderson, and Co., sid the late Tdirectors of-the 'dcekb

(FRoM oUa OWN OORRrPONDENT.
PARIS, TUzsDAY, JAN. 27, 6 p.
A letter from Constantinople of the 16th inst. mentions the following facts:-
" As I stated in my last letter, the members of the conference on the firman convoking the Divans ad hoc in the principalities met on Tuesday last at the house of the Grnd Vizier, Redschid Pasha, to hear the reading of the Imperial firman which had been drawn up at the previous sitting. L TnoAvenDel proceeded to Emyrghein on board the despatch boat Ajaccio, together with General Durando,
inister of Sardinia, M. de Talleyrand Perigord, MY. de Richthefen, the Prussian Commissioner, and the Chevalier de Bensi, Sardinian Commissioner. hL Boutenieff and M. Basili were on board a Russian steamer; hl. deProkesch and Baron Klleer were in the Prince Eugene, and Lord Strat. ford and Sir H. Bulwer in the Sphinx. At half-past I the whole of the Plenipotentiaries were assembled at Redschid Pasha's.
"The firman, as I have already told you, does great credit to Redschid Pasba. All the members of the conferenre were well satisfied with it, with the exception, however, of
. de Prokeach, who could not conceal his discontent. The reading of the document commenced at 3 o'lock and terminated at 4. After the conference Redschid Pasha invited the Plenipotentiaries to dinner. The Commissioners for the Moldo-Russian frontier are about to repair to the spot in pursuance of the resolution of the last conferences of Paris, to give compensation to Russia. Dervish Pasha, the Ottoman Commissioner, who had come to spend a few days at Constantinople, is about to leave immediately to join
hiacolleagues. The labours of the commission are to bej pushed on with the greatest activity. Agla Bey, namedI oommiseioner by the Porte to take possession, in the name of his Government, of the delta of the Danube, left yesterday.
"The Perte is at last beginning to occupy itself seriously with the Bulgarians. That people, who count 4,000,000, have every claim to the attention of the Ottoman Go' vermment. The Bulgarians once had schools of their on
and a national clergy. The Greek Patriaroh, bylittle andI little, changed the Bulgarian into Greek schools, and at the
present moment the Bulgarian clergy have given way I entirely to the Greek priesthood, who are among the most active agents of Russian propapndism. The Greek Patriarch has much to reproach himself with on this head - he has consultod bY. Boutenieff who frankly informed himl that he could not support him, and that he would do wRell to address himself toLordStratford, withwhom the Patriarch had been for a long time on intimate terms. Prince Vogo rides served as the channel of communication, but Lord Stratford knows his ground, and he will not stir in the matter till he sees clearly through it.
"I mentioned in my last letter that the concession of the Euphrates Railroad had been granted to General Chesney, andthatthe Sultan'sratification was expected daily. The Imperial Irade was given yesterday. The concession is for 99 years, on the conditions I have already stated. The ex. pense is estimated at 1,400,000. The port at the head of the line will be made by the Ottoman Government. It will commence from a point near Suedi6 (Seleucia), and will join, by Antioch and Aleppo, Fort Jabor, on the Euphrates. This undertaking, which is intended to counteract the project of the canalization of the Isthmus of Suez, is regarded by competent persons as onerous for Turkey. The guarantee of the Ottoman Government, which is 6 per cent., is, however, a very advantageous investment for English capital. Here, then, are four important concessions granted to English capitalists-the line from Smyrna to Aidin, from Routchouk to Ener, from Su6di6 to the Euphrates, and the Bank of Constantinople.
" The Bagdad courier, arrived yesterday, has brought us news of the English expedition in the Persian Gulf. The Isle of Karrack and the port of Bender-Bushire have been occupied by English troops. The Persian garrison withdrew to the interior. The greater part of the inhabitants remained. The Persian Government push on their preparations for war with great activity. The arsenals are at work night and day, and the Shah often visits them. Troops are constantly moving about. The Russians are concentrating in the Caspian con$iderable bodies of troops. They have evacuated -the Isle of Serpents, and announce that they will evacuate by the 1st of February the whole of the territory that is to be given over to Moldavia.'
I mentioned yesterday that the RBvue de Paris, a Republican periodical appearing every fortnight, has been suspended for a month. In the number prepared for publication on Saturday next an article was to appear on the Bourbons of Naples, written by an Italian gentleman, M. Petrucifli de la Gattina, who has been for some time one of the con-
tributors to the Revue. The following are extracts
from a sketch of the present Queen of the Two Sicilies:-
" With all the domestic virtues vhich the wife of a plain citizen might have recorded on her tomb, she has none.of those gifts, or even of those splendid defects, which characterize a Queen. Serious in character, possessed of solid and even masculine instruction, positive in her tastes, and mathematical even in her aspirations, of strong and precise will, narrow but invariable in her views, cold in temperament, but passionate, calculating, patient, and obstinate, Maria Theresa is of a nature which is lymphatic at the surface, but corrosive at bottom, and is constantly in movement, like the drop of oold water which, falling incessantly, eats its way into the marble. She is impenetrable to the force of poetry, and insensible to the influence of the fine arts. She will gaze on a glorious sunset, hear the music of Donizetti, or read an ode by Victor Hugo with indifference, aud look upon a picture of Schoeffer or Delacroix as if the canvass were an old rag. She feels no enthusiasm, no elevation of mind-not even that mystic and vague aspiration which is not uncommon among German women of e certainclass. She is, in fact, rather a man of business than a woman. She is devoid of anything like taste, and has none of the inclioations of a Queen. She would knit stockings if shehadleisure. Herpleasure is in domestic life. She is not communicative; she is frigid in m anner, precise, and methodical. One would call her haughty and imperious, but she is only reserved. She concentrates her whole soul, as if she were afraid a single feeling would ooze out. She creates around her an atmosphere of isolatien, in order the better to give herself up to internal life. She appears dis. *#ainful-she is only timid. The leisure which attention /to her children, who are all delicate, affords her, she devotes
to the perusal of works of ascetic devotion and to news. .apers. She follows the course of European politics, and keeps up a constant correspondence with Prince Metternich from whom, on her marriage, she received instruc.
fons aund doctrines. Itis from her the King receives his in. spjrations, especially since 1848, and from that moment HIs Majesty has formed no determination, signed no paper, given no opinion, expressed no wish, without consulting her. The policy of Naples at the present day is simply the expression of tho Queen's wilL It is she who caused King Ferdinand to resist the counsels of the Western Powers. It is she who mado him, otherwise so timid, adopt that bullying and ironical style. It is she who keeps him back from the brink of abdication, because, not being Queen-Mother, and being ' v object of publc execration, there would remain to those ilo abdicate no resource but expatriation from a country to which they have caused so much eviL It is she who imparts eRergy -the fatigued and discouraged mind of Fer. dinand ][, and stays the hand which would, perhaps, sign an amnesty, and the decree for the restoration of the system of 1848.

The famous Campagna directs her private police, and Ferdinand Troya '-is the orgqu of her opinions in the CounciL In a word, Queen Theresa is, excepting immoraEty of conduct and violent temper, the heir of Queen Caroline; she continues asa Jesuit what the other practised as a Gendarme. She is neither beautiful nor graceful, but she has the characteristic type of the Hapsburgs-a cross of the sheep and the fox; a type which is made up of goodnature of manner and of cun. ning, and which a line or a feature more or less marked or delicate renders insignificant or distinguished. Her mannersaregrave and reserved,but not elegaut. Poorinsoul.sheis
incapable of comprehending iberty,and therefore she regards allaspiration forit as folly orrebellion. She does not appear *ambitious; she disdains pomp, and everything that prc* d s effect-everything that agitates; one would suppose iiiln-tt, but she is like the lava of Vesvius, which in the dayliaht seems extinguished, but by night is glowing with kit.

M. Billault, the Minister of the Interior, ha3 addressed the following circular to the presidents of the various clubs authorized in Paris by the Government:-
"Sir,-Numerous complaints have reached me against the excessive play in some of the clubs authorized at Paris. These complaints render it my duty to remind the committees of all the clubs that games of chance are stricty forbidden, that there are penalties inscribed in the law in support of this interdiction, and that even in lawful games the Government would see excessive stakes with stroDg displeasure, and, if necessary, would use its authority to pre. vent them. I pray you, Sir, to please to communicate this letter to the members of the club over which you preside. I doubt not they will receive with favour a regulation inspired as much bytheinterest of families as by 'that ol public morality."
The appeal of Verger will come before the Court of Cassation on Thursday. There is, however but little chance indeed of its success, and none, i believe, of any pardon from the Emperor. The executioner has received orders to be in readiness for duty on Frida, if called upon. Such notice is, it appears, us y iven when the appeal of a convict under sentence of death is likely to he rejected, and pardon is hopeless.
I announced this morning the death of the Princess Lieven. She died atmidnight, surrounded by several members of her family. She was in-her 76th year. The malady which cauied her off was an inflammation of the chest.
The weather is more than usually severe in the south of France. A letter from Tarbes of the 25th inst. states that during the previous 15 days the town and neighbourhoodhad been deluged with r and snow, accompanied by a hurricane. ¶ he guata of wind had caused great destruction in the mountains, uprooting trees and overthrowing house In the village of Sers, near Barege, several individuals perished in a snowstorm.

(ROM ou0 OWiN COnRSPoXDZ=T.)
CONSTANTINOPLE, JAW. 16.
The mixed conference between the resident Ministers and the Commissioners, which was to conclude the conferences on the firman regulating the convocation of the Divans ad hor in the Principalities, was held on Tuesday last. The place of meeting was the Grand Vizier's yali, on the Bosphorus ;and the practical result of it, as was to be expected, nothing, except one or two unimportant alterations in the aording of the document.
The idea was good which prompted the Governments to order a conference in which the Commissioners were to take part, receiving the necessary explanations as to the motives which led to the recent framing of the firman, making their observations, and suggesting their obiections. The Conmissioners were thus In some measure identified with those who drew up the firman, and they could not plead afterwards the excuse of not being responsible for the faults of others. Besides this, it was essential that the Commission, whose duty it will be to see the firman carried into effect, should be t:r zoughly acquainted with all the circumstances which accompanied the framing of this document. The question of Bolgrad proved lately how important this was. But there were no small practicaldifficulties in the way of such aixdxed conference. It was necessary that all official susceptibilities should be put aside, and unfortunately the air of Constantinople, with its continual irritating changes, is less favourable to this than that of any other place.
If the Governmentshad decidedthat the Commission should participate from the beginning in all the conferences, thissusceptibility,regulated as itwould have been by telegraphic directions from the Governments, might perhaps not have taken such a decided form, but now that the firman has been drawn up it was rather too much to expect from an Ambassadorial, or perhaps any other human nature, that it should submit its work to be criticized and amended by a body wfhose members, lhuhidpneti
ther pesetposition, are nevertheless inferiors in the official hierarchy. It was therefore natural enough that all the Ambassadors and resident Ministers should make common cause, and put down with a high hand in the very beginning of the conference the only attempt made by the British Commissioner to bring forward some remarks. This was so much the more easily done as none of the other Commissioners seemed to think themselves justified in following his example. The result was that the conference was purely one of form, which confined itself to the reading of the firman, first in, extenso, and then by single articles.
I send you a translation of it. The firman, as it stands now, is a decided imprOvement in many respects on the former project. First of all, the rambling introduction in the Turkish project has been put into a more legible and definite form. The merit of the initiative in the revision of the organic laws of the provinces is left, as in the old document, to the Sultan, and yet the binding force of the treaty of the 30th of March is brought into suffident relief. The most essential part in the introduction, however, is that which defines the action of the Commision by stating that it goes there " to inquire into the actual state of the Principalities, and to propose the bases of their futare orgoanization." Although the Treaty of Paris is ex-
in this respect, yet it was very well to
defi osition of the Commission, as far as this can be done by wrords.
The Principalities are in a provisional state at present, which will last during the time the Commussion shall be at Bucharest, This interregnunm is favouable to every influence which chooses to come forward, and there is a danger lest the real interest of the country should be sacrificed to party intigues. Some power, 'then, besides the weak authority of the Kaimakans was required to superintend the expression of the wishes of the population, and to check the preponderance of one interest over the other
This by right ought to have been the business of the Porte, but according to the wording and spirit of the firinan it will be the duty of the Commission which it will be impossible to avoid. It is all very fine to lay down as a principle that all clases. hould be free* expressing their wishes I nbiassedI
Uit, Desiles the disproportilon in the powers olt, the different classest themselves, there are two or more foreign influences which will not be, idle in endeavouring to make the wishes of the population coincide with their ow". It is therefore not by giving ihe head to all these diverging interests that a really fair view of wishes and wants canbe obtained, but by protecting' the weaker against the stronger, and by excluding as: much as possible-all foreignonesided interference.t
The Turkish Governmebt has distinctly abdi-l cated all righit of, doing so.-by expressing in the prep-
ambl4 of the firan " that any intervention of the, authorities in the elections will be'an abuse, contraryl to the-intentions of the Porte." Th4e Commisslon: is thux, by the force of circumstances, invested with! far gteater power than the treaty of the 30th of' March intended, It wil be mor than a mere .passive organ, which is to tranmitthe wishes of; the Principalities to the Conference at Paris.
Toifforc fainuch failityss possible tothe wishes of the different elaidee to make themselves kiiown, the principle. of a strict, class. representation has been adfpted, an- this qVZ ite logical, for, s it ..haa been laid down " that he Divan hs .only the mision to express tvismez which dIwl be first examied by the C'ommission, and thien discussd between thfe Porte. aad its allies," what was more naturl tha,n to bring the Comlnisson into contact with every class and every interest "separately, hich
wmil be done bp in,.before the Commision theI reports of each committee ?
Although the principle of class representationhas been adopted likewise in the new firman, yet thera is some difference in the manner in which this principIe has been carried out. In the project of tha Forte the existing class division was adopted as a basis, and the clergy, the great Boyards, -th3 emall B3oyards, and the artisans and merchants were represented as such. In the new firmim the different classes of property rather than tha classes which possess them will be represented. Ia some cases, indeed, the two coincide, but ia many more they do not; thus great properties will by no means represent the Boyards of the first class, for there are more proprietors of 300 falshes (the qualification required) who are nob great Boyards than those who are, In the representation of small properties, again, the maximumn of 99 falshes and the minimum of 10 will include many of the smaller Boyards, as well as of the free landholders who are not Boyards. Thus, likewise, in the towns the proprietors of houses of a certain value have a right of voting. The tovwn representation is in general, however, much fairer according to the new firman. The principle of dir3ct election has been adopted instead of that of two degrees, as in the old. All the members of the liberal pro
fessions have a vote; the merchants paying for a. third-clas licence aiid the members of the corporations alone do not vote personally, but send delegates to vote.
The representation of the peasants who are not free proprietors has, as you know already, been accepted, but I was misinformed when I stated. before that they will be allowed to send others than members of their own class as representatives. The question wras diwussed, but not carried. This was a triumpblof logic over common sense. The Comnission is to hear all classea, consequently the peaan.ts likewise in pers. It was in vain common sense pleaded that they. cannot expose the abuses under which they are suffering; that they neither dare to expose them, nor do they know them,-they feel only their effects.
The firman in general is strong in logic, and from an abstract point of view certainly lays down a very fair basis for the expression of the wishes of the Principalities. But it ought to be recollected that human beings are, fortunately or unfortunately, not logical abstractions, but beings animated by practical wvshes and desires. It would have been throughout as well if the firman, instead of minutely detailing and weighing the exact right of representation wvhich each interest and class should possess, had endeavoured to trace out a pratical plan for the workingof the Divan;andthisisjustthevaguest and weakest part of the firan. Nor is this surprising. The working of a public assembly has its own laws, which require the study of a life, and which are neither very logical nor contained in any diplomatic code.
The deputies of the different claRses are to be formed into separate committees, who wil more especially busy themselves with the difforent questions in as far as they have reference to the wants of their own class, and then all the committees wil be united in one general assembly, and discuss over again what has been discussed in the committees. That the representatives of the different Interests should form separate committees was logical and practical, but that, after having discussed the questions from their own point of view and come to an understanding as to their interests as a class, they should be thrown together into one assembly and discuss the same questions from a
eneral point of view, may be, for aught I know, logical, but wiU probably not be found practical.
The experience of all countries where class assemblies have been in existence shows that the different classes whenever they were brought together into one assembly always tenaciously maintained their own exclusive class views, and never could come to an understanding. Is it to be expected that the representatives of the different classes of Moldavia and Wallachia will be the first to divest themselves entirely of their class feeli and give the world a touching spectacle of brotherly harmony? It is possible, but not very probable, especially as they wil have to go exactly over the same ground in. the general assemblies. Had the distinction been drawn that the committees have only to discuss affairs which concern them, leaving, general questions entirely to the assembly at large, there would be more probability of an understanding; but to meet in general assembly, after having discussed all the questions and expressed their opinions about them in the committees, seems the very thing calculated to create disunion.
Not less unsatisfactory than this arrangement about the mode of discussion seems that about the subjects, the only observation being in the last paragraph, where the firman expresses a hope that the Divan wil coniine its discussions within suitable limits, and end its work in six months.
The whole thing is so vague that it would lhe even impossible to decide whether the Divans would be allowed to enter into discussion about the disputed question of union, which is uppermost in all minds, had not the members of the Turkish Government present at the last conference declared that there was no objection to the discussion. But, even if it were more clearly defined what the Divan cau discuss and what it cannot approach, such a negative decision would not very much advance the matter, for it is not sufficient to say that the committees and the Divans have to express wishes, but the subjects must be, at least in a general way, prepared for them, else the prelimlnary debate about what should be discussed will take, not six months, but perhaps six years. You have only to fancy, for instance, 17 persons put into a room and desired to express their wishes about the necessary reforms and utter their views on the general organization of their country.
As the firman is so incomplete on the most important points the Commission will be left to settle them. ow this will be done amongtherepre. sentatives of seven countries, having a more or less indirect interest in a certain settlement of aU questions, the future wil show.
FIRMA" FOR THE CONVOCATION OF THE
DIVAN AD HOC IN WALLACHL&.
"To AIrBxAN;nz GEnA, K&uLxAN - or WALT&AcurL.
" Whereas our Government has at all times endeavoured to maintain the spedal privileges which have been granted by our glorious ancestors to each of the provinces of Wallachia and Moldavia forming integral parts of our empire, and to try to augment and spread the welfare of their populAtion, we vished, also, as a proof of our high sentiments of justice towards all theinbabitants of our States in general, whilo mraintainingthe ancientprivlleges of the inhabitants of the two provinoes, to revise and improve the internal orgaic laws of the aforesaid provinces, in order to complete and assure the welfare of all classes of their inhabitants.
" Thowishesof thePowerabelngin acrdano with oursertiments, we have agreed vith them that the laws and statutes now In force in the aforesaid provinces shallUbe revised, and that, in order to establish a perfect understanding on this revsion, a Special Commission, composed of the dele. gates of the Powers who guaranteed the Treaty of the 30th of March, shall meet in Bucharest, with a Commissary of the Sublime Porte, to inquire into the present state of the Principalities, and to propose the bases of their future o - ganizatlon. Consequently Mohmed Eassad Saafet, Muss-achar of the Grand Vizer, one of the dignitaries of our G - vernment, has been nmed as delegate of the Sublime Forte.
"Having ikewise promised to assemble in each of the
two provinces a Divan ad hoc, so composed as to represent theinterests of all clatses of society, and which will have to express the wishes of the populations with regard to the definitive organization of the Principalities, our Im. perial will is to constibute these Divans on the following bases:-
" Art. I. Besides the Metropolitans and the Bishops of the province, who will be members of the Divan in their own right, the superiors or administrators of the convent, vwhoee property is deditsted to some foreian convent, and the superiors of the convents whose property is not so dedicated, will each choose separately two .deputies,who must be laymen and natives,.that is, four in alL And the priests who fulfil the fuiictlons of their ministry in the seat of ea h bishopmic, whatever theit rank be, wll assemble at the eall
of the bishop of the diocesc,mnd will choose from among' theniselve ohe deputy for each diocese for the Divan

The greti Boyard6 alone who can comply with. this lit condition w,;1 be eligiblo for the districts where they are not domiciled.
" Ar. Il Al proprietors, under 'whatever denomina. t#on they may come, being of 30 years of age, natives f
thb eountry, or a tully and legally natu±alis4 ijjoying all their civil rights) and possessing A ma=jmumof 99falhes or their equivalent in pogones of cultivxted land, or A minimum of 10 falshes or their equivalent in pogones of land of the ame natlre, will assemble in tho chief place of the arrondissoment where they are domiciled, and will clioose from among themselves by a majority of votes five electors of the second degree. These delegates will go to the chief place of the district and name in the same mauner, from among themselves, one deputy for the Divan.
"Art. IV. The rural communities, composed of pea. saunts to whichever class their proprietors may belong, will send each to the chief place of the district two delegates of the first degree, named according to the forms in use for the election of the village authorities. These delegates will choose two among themselves to exercise the funcions of electors of the second degree, ani these electors of the second degree, assembled in the chief place of the district, will name from among themselves a deputy for the Divan, who will receive a suitable oompensatlon for their journey and their stay in the capital.
" Art. V. The town which is the seat of the government will name four deputies for the Divan, the two towns of the second order each two deputies, and the other towns, wich re ehief places of districts, each one deputy. The eloctions will take place on the following bases :-
" On the condition of being 30 sears of age, being natives or actually and legally naturalized, not being subject to any foreign proteoction, and enjoying all their civil rights, candidates for theie deputies are -
".L All inhabitants posessing houses of a value of at least 20,00Q piastres for the capital, and of at least 8,000 piLstres for the other towns, with the exception of those who would be already entitled to vote under the dispositions of Art. IIL and IIL of the present firman.
" 2. Persons exercising a liberal profession, such as the professors in the schools of the State, the members of academies, or literary and scientific societies recognized by the Government-such as medical men, lawyers having a regular diploma, and civil engineers, al exercising their profesalonsfor the pre9eding threeyears in thetownLin which they reside.
"3. Merchants, having a Heence of the third class, And inscribed on the last lists prepared for the election of the municipalities
" 4. The provosts of the different corporations, to whom wvil be joined three delegates chosen by the corporation, according to the forms in use for the nomination of the provosts.
" All the electors abovenamed will assemble at the seat of the municipality, and will choose there fromamong them. selves by a majority of votes, without being allowed to give a double vote, the number of deputies which each town, according to its order, has to send to the Divan.
"Aithough the arrival of theCommissioners of thePowers must be waited for before the election of the deputies can take pluae, the electoral lists will be made out immediately after the publication of the present firman. The administrators of the districts will therefore be ordered to taLe the neces'ary measures to have these lists published and stuck up, wherever need be, at least 30 days before the period fixed for the elections, so that time may be given for appeals being made. These appeals wi be examined bya committee composed of the Isprovnik, the members of the Tribunal, ane of the municipality of the chief place of the district. All intervention of the authorities in the elections, except to maintain order, will be considered as an abuse, and is, in fact, contrary to the intentions of the Subllime Porte; consequentlythe Ministers, the Directors of Departments, and the Isprovniks cannot come forward as electors or be elected unless they resign their functions.
"In order to avoid allconf usion, the elections which have to be made in the chief places ef the district will take place successively in the order laid down for the classes who have to send representatives to the Divan. The same wilU h the case for the elections in the chief place of the district.
" The deputies of the different classes united in a general assembly will constitute the Divan ad hoc, called to express the wishes of the Principality with regard to the statutes and regulations now in force.
" In order the better to obtain this object the deputies of each class will form so many different committees, who will more pricularly study the different questions in their relation to the interests and wauts of their own elass.
" The Divan having only the mission to express wishes, which will be first examined by the Commisgion, composed of the deleptes of the Porte and those of the guaranteeing Powers, and then diseussed between the Sublime Porte and its allies, the propositions of the different committees will be embodied in separate reports, which will be presented to the General Assembly, and, as well as the result of the deliberations of this assembly, placed before the Commission.
" The President of the Divan will be the Metropolitan, assisted bya Vice-President, ele^todfrom among the Boyards of the first class by a majoriit of votes in the genePl7 assembly.
"The secretaries, in number equal to that of the classes which are represented, will be likewise named by a rajoney of votes.
" Each committee will choose its own president by X majority of votes.
" In its desire to accelerate the moment when the Pro vince shall be in possession of a definitive organization, the Sublime Porte e.xpects of the Divan that it will have terminated its labours in the space of six months, and that. impressed by the sentiment of its duty of fidelity, it will not fail to restrict its discussions within suitaw7e limius, and thus spare us the displeasure of having to devise means to protect against all impeacbinent our august rigl'ts of sovereignty."
A similar firman has been sent to the Kaimakan of Moldavia.
PRUSSIA.
THE SOUJND DUE.
(FrnOM OURn OV , COREESPONDENT.)
BERLIN, JTAN. 26.
For some time past the papers of North Germany have been publishing statements with reference to the Sound dues which have alternated between sanguine anticipations of their immediate repeal in consequence of the opening of the final conferences on this subject in Copenhagen, and melancholy apprehensions lest the difficulties that have intervened to prevent the immediate fulfilment of their hopes and desires should be of a nature to disappoint them altogether, or defer their gratification till some indefinite period. I believe the real state of the proceedings in the matter of the Sound dues will be found to be neither so bad as they fear nor so good as they hope.
Various communications from Copenhagen of a private nature have led to a belief that the fnal or winding-up conferences for the settlement of the Sound dues' question were reopened there on the 15th inst. Some corroboration of this information was found in the circumstance that the Russian delegate, AL Tengoborski, arrived there about that time, and that the gentleman appointed by the Swedish Government to assist its present representative at Copenhagen (Admiral Virgin) in this matter was summoned to repair to the Danish capital; and, further, by the fact of the courier correspondence between our Government and our Minister there having become very frequent of late. How important it is for Denmark to bring the negotiations to a speedy and favourable conclusion we may estimate from the circumstance that next June-is the deferred and preclusive term up to which the United States of America have agreed to continue the payment of the dues, though under protest; and, on the other hand, how desirable it is for the States trading to the Baltic to interpose no insuperable difficulties in the way, from the fact of the number of the vessels that passed the Sound last year having amounted to 20,532, being 4,745 more than passed through in the preceding year, and lmost equalling the laMrgest numbers on
record-viz., tlhose of the years 1853 and 1847.
The Danis3 papers, however, say nothing at all of the final conferences having been reopened in Copenhagen, and information, on 'which I can rely, shows me that they have not as yet been reopened. At the same time it is a great exaggeration to represent the difficulties that have presented themselves -chiefly on the side of France-as though they were of a nature to endanger the settlement of the question at no distant time on the basis already obtained. This basis may, I believe, be correctly state as.follows :-All thbStates most-inttersted in the.Baltic trade, representing about six-aevenths of the whole amount involved, have agreed that the blackmail hitherto levied by Denmarkupon the naiation of that sea under the name of the Sound dueJs shaU be redeemed by one payment made once foriall, that the amoul ,payable by each State -for this redemption of .the-Sound dues shan be equivato 20 yean' purchase of the sum hitherto annually paid by each'of theini; aid that the amount of their ,redomptionsimney need not to be paid down in full,
but by iinstalfiente where prmerred, the balauce, however, lb'arig interest.
The difference that has arisen between the various Statee interested ana Dewnark hai reference to the *rate of interest that shall be paid on the balance- of the redemption-m-oney after deducting the instalments. The Danish Government has proposed that each State shall be charged interest at
the ote cbzrent in - 4 t iSeIF. 40d not at an uniformlrate of intereul fosr W as, for inatalice, the rate of interest in Denmark: We consequence is, that France fe6ls1iersdeiplaoeaby 1tiis prop6sed arrangement at a diIadvantage s`coi6pwed with England; for, while the Go rment rat of ixterest with us is asumed to be 3 per cent., that current in France is notoriously 5 per cent. In Prussia, too, the Government rate of interest is 4 per cent., and at the highest 4.; but T do not hear that this Government has instructed its representative to throw any difficulties in the way of settlement on that account. The current rate o interest in Russia is 8 per cent. What the Government generally pays for loans at home, if it ever contracts any, I never heard; what it pays for foreign loans is generally 5 per cent. The sudden departture from Copenhagen of M. Tengohoraki, the Russian delegate to the Sound Dues' Conferences, is not causEed by any difficulties in thewayof his executing his misson; he has left there for Paris, where his wife has fallen ill. Nt is stated here, though on insufficient authority, that the representative of France in Copenhagen has just ver recently, say within the last week, received mstructions to comply with the proposals of the Danish Government on this point of the interest to be paid; but this has as yet met with no confirmation. As, moreover, the possibility of differences of opinion arising on the modtss of paying, after the main question of the amount to be paid, had been fc,reseen, and arrangements had been made for Denmark to enter into separate negotiations with any small minority of individual States that tight keep aloof from the agreement made by the bulk, it is not probable that this hitch, assuming it to be still in existence, will be allowed to stand in the way of the navigation of the Sound and Belts being freed from impotst in the course of this year. The voice of the majority of European States that have come into the abreement would be with Denmark to back her in the extension of its provisions to the remainder who at present have not conformed to it.
That the Sound duea wiU be abolished by the different States buying themselves off according to the uota of their interest may be assumed as certam and as very probable indeed that it will takeaiay this year. The Danisl Government is alreay=turning its attention to what must be done for Elsinore, which, it is supposed, must inevitably be ruined by the discontinuance of the toll, which compelled all ships to lie to off there and pass their papers at the office of the Danish authorities. The indirect advantage accruing to Denmark from this compulsory stay off sinore is evident from the exitence of the town itself being considered compromised by the discontinuance of the compulsion, while the amount of evil and damage to which foreign shipping was exposed by that detention in the rapid stream and crowded navigation of the Sound may be best estimated by noticing the nature of the measure the Danish Government contemplates resorting to now that it loses the power to compel that detention. It is going to apply a large portion of the redemption money to be received to the construction of a commodious harbour at Elsinore, where vessels may ride at anchor in safety while 'waiting for a favourable change of wind.

The Bank Charter.
THB BANK CHARTER.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-An intelligent correspondent under the signature "X." expresses in She Tmes of tho 20th of January some very sound opinions on the general subject of the currency, but he shows by his introductory comments upon the Bank of England that he shares the prevalent idea that the Bank retains the entire profit of the issue department.
" XI" proposes, as a fair compromise between the Bank and the public, that the Bank should relinquish a portion of its gain on the authorized credit issue of 14,000,0001. by reducing the interest charged on the Government debt of 11,000,0001. from 3 to 1 or 1I per cent.; in other words, that the Bank should give up 220,0001., or at least 165,0001. The proposed division of profits has, in fact, though in a somewhat different manner, been in existence since 1845, to the fixed amount of 180,0001.
By the correspondence which took place in -1844 between Government and the Bank (Parliamentary Paper 246, sems. 1844) it appears that the interest derived from the 14,000,0001. of securities was assumed to be £420,000 of which was allowed to compounding
Bankers relinquishing their own issues 24,000
396,000 The co0ts of the issue was taken at ... 113,000
Leaving the net profit at £8... .. £2S3,000
It was agreed that the Bank should out of this sum pay to the Government, as stamp duty, 60,0001., and a further sum of 120,0001., which, together deducted, left 103,0001. to the Bank as its share of the profits of the issue of bank-notes. The stipulation then made, " that the public should be entitled to receive the whole net profit of any issue of notes founded on any addition to the fixed amount of securities," has recently come into action by the addition (prompted bythe Government) of 475,0001. to the securities of the issue department.
It appears, then, that of the profits derived from the credit issue of 14,000,0001. the Bank paid to the
Government ... ... ... ... .18o,000 And to compounding bankers ... 24,000
Together .... 204,000,
or very nearly li per cent. on the amount of issue.
The credit issues of the private and joint-stock banks of England and Wales authorized in 1844, to the extent of 8,631,6471., have been reduced by retirements and failures to 7,908,0041., and have practically not exceeded 7,000,0001. during the past year. A contribution of 1A per cent. to the Government would amount to 105,0001. upon the smaller sum.
The credit issues of the Scotch and Irish banks are fixed by the Act of 1845 at 9,441,7031. A contribution to the extent of 1 per cent. upon this issue would be 141,6001. The Scotch, Irish, and English banks together, contributing to the public revenue at the same rate at the Bank of England, would supply a sum of 246,6001. The sum they have actually contributed as stamp duty or composition for duty is given in the finance accounts of 1855 at 64,9621., in addition to which each bank pays 301. annually for its license.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The English Government has for very palpable reasons, printed as a separate account the net produce of Irisht revenue and theanount of Irish expenditure for 1855, thus :
"Netproduce of Irish revenue for 1855 ... £6,056,272 "Expenditure for same period ... £6,152,017
"Balance against Ireland ... ... £9,75"
Considering the unequalled load of sorrows that have pressed so heavily on our sister isand, such a state of thinga is far from being discreditable to her. But I would ask our astute rulers why they did not likewise give the income and expenditure of Scotland separately? Is it because by so doing they would he obliged to confess that if the comparative taxation and expenditure of Scotland were a plied to Engdland there wouled not be a penny of our nationaS debt

The only questin however, involving any interest, and which didi net formI t a portion of the p 1afgs, was as follows :-The plaineffs in 1852, took the benefit of the protection acts
and the defendants having discovered this fact, the plain. tiffs before the hearing of thie cause paid the schedule creditors, and obtained a dismissal Of the petitiont in the Insolvent Court. The defendants at the hearing objedted that this did not sufficiently cure the objection to enable the plaintijffs to sustain the suit.
Mr. GLrgEss and Mr. W. D. EvANs, for the plaintiffs, against the obgection cited the 1st and 2d of Victoria, cap. 110, aec.1.5, the 4th and 6th of Victoria, cap. 116, sees. 1 and 7 an'd the 7th and 8th Of Victronra cap. 96, sec. 10, to show that the plaintiff's interest was completely revested by the order of dismissal. As to the revestin
having the effect of precluding the objection of irregularity in the suit, the 53d section of the 15th and 1Cth of Victoria, cap. 86, " Tudway v. Jones"' (1, Kay and John 691)
and "Preston v. Wilson" (5, Hare, 185), were cited and it was arwed that the objection, being purely formal, ought to have been taken in a strictly forma way by plea, and could not be entertained at the hearing.
Mr. BAITY and Mr. HAxRDy appeared for the defendants, and in supportof the objection, and cited the 5th and 6th of Victoria, cap. 116, secs. 1, 7, and 9; the 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 96, se. 10 ajorv. Auckland" (3 Hare 77) ; " WearinFv.E 26L.X,Y;

The VICz-CsrANcELLon said that, as be was of opinion that the plaintiff Was entitled to the relief which he asked, it was unnecessary for him to express any opinion upon the technical question of the plaintift's right to sue. His Honour then stated the circumstances relating to the deed sought to bo rectiefid, and said that the principle up)on which the Court proceeded in rectifying deeds was that where it was clear (not being a probability merely, even a strong one) that the parties had a certain intention, and that was not carried out by reason of a mistake, the Court there would rectify that mistake.-" Duke of Bedford v. the Marquis of Abercorn" (1, M. and Cr., 331), "Marquis Breadalbane v. Marquis of Chaudos " (2, M. and Cr., 7u9), "Both v. Hutchinson" (5, De Gex, K, and G., 569). There was a notion in old times that some writing was necessary, and no doubt in a settlement particularly it was more satisfactory and less dangerous. In the present case the evidence was not such as to show clearly and conclusively that the deed sought to be rectified was not in accordance with the contract of the parties. Hence the plaintiff's bill must be dismissed.

PEDBRE1Nq V. JOIsNSON.-JO Nsox V. PERnnSs,
The question in these causes, which have occupied the Court for three or four days, was whether a purchase by two partners of the share and interest of a third partner in a colliery, at a sale by public auction, by the sheriff of War. vickshire, under a wrxt of .i1 fa. issued against such third partner at the instance of a creditor, Was, under the circumstances of the case, valid. By a lease dated in December, 1851, Johnson, the defendant in the first suit and the plaintiff in the second suit, became the lessee for 21 years of certain coalmines situate at Wolnecote, in the parish of Tam. worth, in Warwickshire. In April, 1853, a partnership for the purpose of working the above coalmines having been arranged between Johnson and Perrens and Harrison, the tiwo Last-named of whom were the plaintiffs in the first suit and the defendants in the second suit, Johnson, with the consent of the landlord of the mines, assigned to Perreun and Harrison two equal undivided third parts or shares of the mines for the then residue of the term of 21 years, as tenants in common. By articles of partnership dated in June, 1853, Johnson, Perrens, and Harrison aeed to become purchasers, for the purpose of working tne ines and se llg the produce thereof for the residue of the term of 21 years, under the stylo of " Perrens, Harrison, and Johnson." One of the provisions of the articles of partnership was to the effect that if either of the partners should at any time during the continuance of the partnership suffer his share in the capital stock of the partnership to be taken in execution for any debt, and the others or other of the partners should thereupon give notice in writing of their or his desire that the co-partnership should forthwith cease, then, at the expiration of one calendar month from the time of such notice being given, the partnership should cease. Immediately after the execution of the articles of partnership Perrens, Harrison, and Johnson proceeded to work for ooal, the greater portion of the capital necessary for that purpose being advanced by Perrens and Harrison. The coal, however, was not so readily got as had been anticipated, and Johnson became somewhat straitened for money. On the 4th of July, 1855, before the coal was reached, one of Johnson's creditors issued execution against him to recover 2831., aed his interest in the colliery Was taken in execution by the sheriff of Warwickshire, under a fi. fa. for the recovery of that amount. Perrens and Lrzison then, on the 9th of July, 1855, gave Johnson notice of their desire that the partnership should cease at the expiration of one calendar month from that period, as provided by the articles of patnership. On the 11th of July, 1855, a Lle by public auction took place under the direction of the sheriff of War. wickshire of Johnson's interest in the colliery, and Perrens and Harrison being the highest bidders became the purchasers thereof at that sale for the sum of 5001. Of this sum a balance of 1641. was received by Johnson after buying the execution creditor and the expenses attending the execution, On the 28th of July, 1855, the sheriff of Wrick. shire assigned, ao far as he lawfully mlight or could to Per. rens and Harrison all the estate, share and in'ere6t
Johnson in the colliery to hold to them all the esate, term, and interest of Johnson therein. The original bill prayed for a declaration that the partnership was dissolvedvon the 28th of July, 1855, and that:olinson'sshare anmdinterest on
the partnership effects were, bsolutelY vested in Perrens and Harrison, and for an account of all sums due toor byPer. rens and Harrison from or to Johnson; or, if it sahod ap. pear that the sale did not operate as an effectual tran_ er of Johmson'x share, then the bill prayed fonr tn account of the partnership dealings and transations so far as related to Johnson. The cros biUl prayed that the sale to Perrens and Harrison of Johnson's share and interest in the coliery made on the 11th of July, 1855, and the assignment of the 28th of July, 1855, by the sheriff might be set aside on Johnson paying to Perrens and Harrison the sum of 5001., paid byj them to the sheriff, and that the col. liery might be sold aknd the partneDrship wound up.
Johnson.~~~~~~~~Prtn hIrison suXd liBrelialtdnsppea Mr Rnshwrfor MIr.
The VIcCX ANCXLLOR said the mLterial queition in the cas,e was whetberthe sale which was made ~ky the a'iAeriff to the plaintiffs in the orlginal bill was such *,&le as could enable them to ho]A'as purchasers ofJonn a interest in the coliery. ThJsae -was impeached as-fraudulentadd as being made undet circumstance which would renderit impoEss le to, be sustadned against JohnEon's r3ght. Itw was made At a >ost critical prinod of the partnerahip,- -for whenit tookplace thei workmen were -withini a shortdistaniee of reaching a valuable seam of- coal. Johnson compaiid that af ter the exocution was igssed access to the mlnb wts prevented and persons were mot allowed to go down kit in. pet it. In a oae of this kind rit was of the utmo*t importnce to show that no aupicion, not the slightest speek of misconduct, could attach to the partners who had become the purchasers of tho share of the partner whose shre hid been takenin execution. On the one hand itmilght beaald that the rights of the solvent partners would be interfered with by strangers inspecting the mine, but on the other a Eale could hardly be considered as fair when persons who
mnight become purchiasers were niot all.wed an, opportunity Of inppecting what was Put utp for Sale and ascertainiog its 'value. It was also. nece!s3rj that there should be no concesiment. One witness -1i that ironstone had been found in the minie before the sale, and was stacked near the pita -onth, bat that on the 9th of July,
two days before the sae, Pesrens gave-directions that the ironstone should be buried in rubbisb, so that it could not be seen by any one. Perrens, in his cro3ssexami
nation, had au opportanity of contradicting that witness, but his evidence on cross-examination led to the impression that something of the kind itmputed to him had taken place. The fact, likewise, that the coal vas reached a very short time after the works were resamed did not create a favourable impression of the couduct of the purchasers, although that circumstance occurred after the sale took place. Wheu Perrens was informed that the coal was reached, one witness, who wa.s a workmnan, said he received directions from Perrens not to mention it to any one, and also to tell the men not to say anything about it. Looking at all the circumestances of the case, ths relation of the parties, the exclusion of porsons from seeing the mine, and, what must be taken to be true, the direction given by Perrens to bury the ironstone, so that it should not be seen, it was impossible consistently with the principles which governed this Court to treat Perrens and Harrison as having acquired a right by purchise to Johnson's share in the coliery. As to that part of the case in which it was said that Johnson had ratified the sale by receiving the balance of the purchase-money, it was iampossible that his receipt of it could have that effect, for it id not appear that when he received it he had that full lknowledge of aU the circumstances attendinL the sale which could enable him to know what course he ought to take, or by which he could be concluded from questioning it. There would be a decree to set aside the sale made by the sheriff, to wind up the partnership, and for a sale of the partnershipwproperty. His Honour acquitted Messrs. Perrens and ilarr-on of having acted fraudulently, being of opinion that they had been placed in circumstances of great difficulty.
(Before Vice-Chancellor Sir W. P. WooD.)
SMITH V. L.ON.
The arguments in this part-heard case were resumed.
It appeared from the statements in the bill that in Jannary, 1853, Alfred Smith, who was described as a general dealer, and who was also in work at a brewery in Manchester, applied to the plaintiff, who was his brother, and in bnch superior condition of life, for assistance to enable him io emigrate and establish himself in Australia. The plaintifff who had already advanced his brother 1,9991., for which he held his promissory note, communicated with a MIrs. Price, and it was arranged that she should advance 1,285d. to Alfred Smith, for which the plaintiff should be
liable as surety, the advances being also secured by the I promissory note held by the plaintiff and a policy or policies of assurance to be effected on the life of Alfred Smith. Two policies for 4991. each were effected by Mrs. Price upon the life of Alfred Smith in the United Service and General Life Assurance Guarantee Association, and were by her assned to the plaintiff in consideration of 2901. already pair, and in further consideration that the plaintiff would give other securities to Mrs. Price for the liabilities contracted by his brother daring his residence in England and since his arrival in Australia. Notice of this assignment was given to the office. In September, 1854, Alfred Smith died in Australia. Upon application by the plaintiff for the money payable upon the policies held by him the 'United Service, &c., Guarantee Association had refused payment, and, in answer to the bil filed aainst them by the plaintiff, had goneinto evidence to a considerable extent with a view of establishing a ease of misrepresentation as to the life and habits of Alfred Smnith at the time of effecting the assurance upon his life, showing that he was a man of intemperate habits, of weak health, and continuaUy spitting blood, the result of a serious accident to his chest from the upsetting of a brewer's dray. This evidence was met with evidence on behalf of the plaintiff in direct contradiction to the ease thus attempted to be set up.
Mr. Rolt, Mr. Malcolm (of the common law bar), and Mr. Danney appeared for the plaintiff.
Mr. SHAa'mR, on behalf of the company, contended that, without in any way imputing fraud to the plaintiff, there had been such misrepresentation as to the health and general habits of Alfred Smith as to entitle the company to refuse payment of the policies. The plaintiff, moreover, had not such an interest in the life of the assured as to entitle him to recover upon the policies.
Mr. ROLT replied upon the evidence as to blood spitting and intemperate habits of Alfred Smith, to which points he had been desired to confine his reply.
The VicE-CsHAe.Ncou said that he vwould give judgment to-morrow.

COLERUDGE. WaIrTNI <Ad ft l Pnn- I
OF APPEAL OF THE PROVnCE OF CANTeERBURY).
In this case a rule had been granted calling upon Sir John Dodson, judge of the Court of Appeal of the province of Canterbury, to show cause why a mandamus should not issue, commanding him to admit a libel and appeal from the decision of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the appeal being from the decision of the Archbishop sitting in the diocess of Bath and WeLls as statutory substitute for that bishop. The rule was granted on the part of Archdeacon Denison on the first day of the present term. On a subsequent day an application was made to the Court for two learned civilians, or, as they were technically called by the Court, " a pair of doctors," to be allowed to come in to argue the case, and the request was granted.
At the sitting of the Comrt this day, which had been specially appointed for the argument, as soon as the case was called on,
Mr. H. 1hLL, Q.C., with whom was Dr. Phillimore and .Mr. Coleridge, rose and said he understood Sir F. Kelly and Mr. Fortescue, who were to show cause against the rule were not in attendance.
Dr. BAYFORD then rose and said he had received a. note fxom Sir F. Kelly, stating that last night he had met with a slight accident, which rendered him unable to attend to-4ay, and he would therefore beg the Court to allow the case to be postponed til to-morrow.
Lord CAMPBELL said the Court would bear the learned Doctor, who, he had no doubt, would do justice to the question.
Mr. HILL said a letter had been received by his (Mr. Hill's) attorney from Sir John Dodson, intimating that he did not propose to appear by counsel to show cause against the rule, conceiving it more respectful to the Court to adopt that course.
Lord CAMPBELL said there would be no disrespect in Sir John Dodson's appearing by counseL
Dr. BAYFORD said he appeared on the part of the Rev. Mlr. Ditcher to show cause why this writ of mansdamua shoud not issue, and in so doing he felt some difficulty arising from the circumstance that the question involved a technical point which lay out of his usual practice. He should therefore beg the indulgence of the Court.
Lford CAPsIBELL.-The question is wvhether, on the construnction of the Church Discipline Act (the 3d and 4th of
icethoria,cap. 86), there is an appeal to the judge of the
Dr. BAYFonD said he would address himself to that question, and, in the first instance, wonld cite some authorities to sbow what an appeal was. Burn, in his crclCeriastiAd Leaws, defined an appeal to be the removal of a cause from an inferior to a superior judge, whereby the jurisdiction of the inferior judge was for a while suspended. The very nature of an appeal implied a proceeding from an inferior to a superior Judge. That was the definition of an appeal given by the civil law, L&gilimet ad superiorem ab injeriore prorocatio. To the sane effect was the passage in ODghton's Ordo Judiciormv, s. 274; Si jeudex, &o. An appeal lay from the person constituted, appointed, or delegated, to the person who constituted, appointed, or delegated him; and it was against all the principles of ecclesiastical law to proceed from a superior to an inferior, or from a person who had a delegated commission to the 'person from whom the delegated commission was delegated. In regard to appeals to the Archbishop's
rt, there was a statute (prior to the statute of E enry VlII.) which introduced the Court of Delegates, aund that statute (the 19th of Henry ViII., c. 12, s. 71 enacted that the appeal from the Court of Audience and the Court of Arches should be to the archbishop personally. That was in exact accordance with the rule which he (Dr. Bayford) now brought under the attention of the Court. It was before the archbishop himself these proceedings had taken place; and the question now was whether an appeal lay from the archbishop to the judge of the Court of Arches, presided over by a judge appointed by the archbishop. According to all ecclesiastical principles that could not be, unless, indeed, the statute had given such an appeal.
Lord CAMPBELL.-YOU must not assume that the archbishop was sitting En archbishop. That is to be proved.
Dr. BAYFORD said he should show thatthe statute proved that. Before the statute passed clerks could be tried in the Consistorial Court of the bishop. Whether the bishop could sit personally in such court was doubted; his night was not acknowvledged.
Lord CAssvnEas..Suppcsing a case in which the bishop is nteesed,due te ecleiaticl aw mnake any provision for a substitute to sit for himn7?
Dr. B,AYvOnn said he could not answer the question In
tway. If the judge of the Consistory Court were intereste thre oul bea prorocatio, or appeal to another judtge,on theground that the judge was tnquam suspectus,
hut ethoghtthat would hardly apply to a bishop.
Lord C Bisn, observed that, probably, in ancient times the bishop decided p noprio trigre.
Dr. BAYFORD said there wero no records of those times,
but,a them stbatut tbuna toh or f rhs V
but before the ugstett now in question there was a n rOceeding when ta e That was sosctts and that was so laia dovn in Oaplstos. Before the statute' tlhe bishop had the right to sit in the Consistory Court forthe trial of a, clerk, but it was not an acknowledged right, and it was not put in force. Then came, the statute, which took away from the Oonsistorial Court the power of tryinlg a clerk at all, for he (the clerk) could now only be tried nder the statute.
Lord CA' 11SELL.-It creates a new tribunal.
Dr. BAYF'OsD Said he wvould sihow that there was no appeal from that tribunal to the Court of Arches., What
vas the tribunal whioh the statute established ? It was the bishop himself, sitting personally., with assessors pointed out
iy the statute. That e.ing so, it would seem that, without looking at the statute, the natural aPPeal would be to the archbishop presiding in another court, also assisted by zaiCe sors. 0+

lord CAmrBEL. Lsaid, suppose the Archbishop of Canter. bury were interested, and th Archbiehop of York should sit, would not he sit as substitute for the Archbishop of Canterbury ?
Dr. BAkFOIiD said, that mnight be so; but wherever the Avlhbishop of. anterburyp resided personally it beeame the Archbishop's Court. The effeot of his presiding was to inake it the Archbishop's Court. He had an inherent power as archbishop of going into any diocess in his pro. -vines and holding his court there ; and he (Dr. Ba1ford) contended the statute called the power which resided in the archbishop into exercise whenever the bishop of the diocese was patron.
Lord CAarPsELL.-DO you impugn the decision of this Co,urt, that the archbishop must sit in the diocess when sitting for the bishop?
Dr. BAYPOBD said, he did not, for that decsion coincided with the view he was taking. The question was, what power did the act call upon the archbishop to exercise ? Was he locum tenen4 of the bishop, or was he, as the arch. bishop, to exercise the inherent 1power which the law asknowledged tobelong tohim? Thelf5th section of theact
have ti ppeal, and on that eve thiDg must turn. The
o nacted, " That it s l be lawful for any party Nvho shall think himself aggrieved by the judgment pronounced in the first instance by the bishop, or in the court of appeal of the province, to appeal from such judgment; and such appeal shall be to the archbishop, and shall be heard before the judge of the court of appeal of the province, when the cause shall have been heard nd determined in the first instance by the bishop, and shall be proceeded in in the said court of appeal in the same manner, and subject only to the same appeal as in this act is provided with respect to ca sent by letters of requestto the said court* and the appeal sball be to the Queen in Council and shall be heard 6fore the JudicialCommitteeof the Privy Council, when the cause shall have been heard and determined in the first instance in the court of the archbishop." Having stated that there should be two appeals, the itatuth enacted that, in the case where the cause was heard in the first instance by the bishop, " such appeal shall be to the archbishop." In the present case the archbishop sat for the bishop, and so the appeal would be to the archbishop personally. But the parties did not go to the archbishop at all; they went to Sir John Dodson, judge of the Arches Court, a judge appointed by the archbishop.
Lord CANIPBELT..-The act says-" Such appeal shall be to the archbishop ;" but it goes on'to say that it "shall be heard before the judge of the court of appeal of the province"'
MIr. Justice WiGHimAN said, the section went on to say that the appeal " shaU be proceeded in in the said court of appeal in the same manner and subject only to the same appeal as in this act is provided with respect to cases Eent by letters of request to the said court."
Lord CA.'4PDEiL.-That section shows that the appeal is to be to the Arches Court. It says who is to hear the appeal, and that must be to the judge -who is to decide.
Mr. Justice WIGnTnAsN.-If the case had been sent by letters of request who would have been the judge ?
Dr. BAYFORD.-Sir John Dodson.
Mr. Justice WIGIITmAN. -The section provides that the appeal shall be proceeded in in the same manner as if it had been sent by letters of request.
Dr. BAAYFORD at some iength contended that the appeal under this section was to the Cout of the Archbishop, where he sat personally, and where everything was done mn the archbishop's name. It would be a solecism to say that the appeal should go from the archbishop to a judge a - pointed by himself. The first step in an appeal was tMe issuing of an '- inhibition," forbidding anything to be done till the archbishop is satisfied. It would be a strange thing that such an " inhibition" should go from the judge of the Arches Court to the archbishop.
Lord CAMIPBELL.-The archbishop prJ hfc vice is the Bishop of Bath and WeUs.
Dr. BAyFoiPD said, there was another point of objection to the writ ; the parties (the archdeacon) had another remedy.

Dr. nYFORD said, they could go to the Queen in Council
erosnpect of the judgment pronounced by Sir John
Lord CAMPBELL said, this Court ought not to deprive them of the right to have the judgment of the Arches Court.
mr. Justice Cot oGE.-What would be the nature of the appeal? Would it be in reference to the judgment pronounced, or on the principal matter?
Lord C&ssrlB .-Would the case be remitted to the Court of Arches, or would the Judicial Committee decide without the judgment of the Court of Arches?
Dr. BAYFORD.-It would entertain the original question. Lord CAmsiPEaL.-That would deprive the parties of the judgment of the Court of Arches, which the Legislature intended they should have.
Mr. Justice CoucinDGL-It is no answer to say the parties have another remedy unless it is as full as the one they seek.
Dr. BAYFORD said, the court of appeal usuaUy heard the original question, though there were some cases whece that was not done.
Lord CA.MPBELL.-Stil that would deprive the parties of the judgnent of the Court of Arches, which the statute provided they should have.
Mr. PFOBTEccuy followed on the same side.
Dr. P nalsmoR4, Mr. H. HRr, Q.C., and Ar. CoLriRUDfG, who appeaxed in support of the rule, were stopped by the Court.
Lord CA3isBzLL said,-If this were a doubtful case it would be our duty to grant the mandamus, so that the omopui of a superior court might be taken on the question o law,whethert crceis this appeal frorathe Court which has decided to theArches Court. But we are of opinion-at least I amn of opinion, andl I believe my brethrenL agree with me-that it is not a doubtful question. It seems to me clear, looking at the act of Parliament, that there is an appeal to Sir John Dodson, as Dean of the Arches Court, respecting the decision, aud that Sir John Dodson was wrong when he adjudged that there was no such appeal. It seems to follow as a necessary consequence from the decision of this Court when it said that the trial must take place in the diocess of Bath and Wells. I was not a party to that decision, being at the time engaged on the trial of William Palmer at the Central Criminal Court, but I entirely concur in it. The principle of that decision is that, on the construction of the act of Parliament the individual ac° hbishop who sat on this trial was not in his own jurisdiction, but vw
'ocum tenens of the Bishop of Bath and Wells, and was sitting as a diocesan, and not as a provincial court. I will in a few words express the reasons which have induced me to come to that conclusion. The 15th section of the act gives the appeal. When the trial takes place before the
shop in his diocesan court the appeal is not to the archbishop personaUy, but to the Dean of the Arches; it is " to the archtishop, and shall be heard before the court of appeal of the province," that is the Dean of the Arches, not his Grace the Archbishop. That being so, when the trial takes place before the bishop of the diocess, he not being interested, we are to see what is to be done when he is interested. That is provided for by the 24th section of the act of Parliament ,which enacts, "1That when any act, save sending a case of letters of request to the court of a p peal of the province is to be done, or any authority is to be exercised by a bishop undr tis ct,suc ac shllbe done or aumthority exercised by the archbishop of the province, in all cases where the
bishop who would otherwis do the act or exercise the auLthorit as the patron of any preferment held by the party accused." Therefore, -where the party accused holds preferment in the gift of the bishop, the archbishop is to do the act which the bishop ought to have done, and shall exercise that jurisdiction. That is plainly saying that, prop, vtice, he is to act as diocesan. This is net a provincial act. He is to proceed according to the machinery provided by the act, and to have assessors. That tribunal is pri by the act of Parliament. A special tribunal is to be presided over, pro Mn vice, by the person -who happens to be archbishop, not as I'rim;to of all England, but as a substitute for the bishop. By way of illustration, I may suppose that I was interested ia a case to be tried in this couart, and was to ask the Lord Chief Baron to sit for me, and the case was to be tried by him; it would still be a proceeding in the Court of Queen!'s Bench. We thus get ridl of the ouly arguraent against the rule-that this was an appealaodcodenmad cundemn. Itisnot so; it is ari appeal from the person who happened to be Archbishop of Canterbury to the judge of the Arches Court, wvho may take a different view of the question decided. The learned judge appears to have been shoekked at the idea of there being an appeal to him from the arch. bishop, hut there was no such appeal, so that the learned judge need not have been under aniy such apprehension. By the 24th section the archbishop was merely substituted for the bishop, and this Court held that it was a diocesan court when it decided that the trial could not take place in the Arches Court. Under the 15th section there is an appeal to the Court of Arches, over which Sir John Dodson so worthily presides. It has een rge by r. Byfod tht weougt no tointerfer bymonamu, bcaue her isan p~el fomthe decison f Sr JhnDodon o te Jdiial(,omiteeof the Priy Cuncl. her issuc anappal,and no doubt they woul deideas e ae ding bu thy wuldnot remit the
court or appeal, and the appelant would lose what he is entitled to-vyi, the judgment of the Arches Court. I see no reason why the mandamus should not go, and therefore I am of opinion that the rule should be made absolute.
Mr. Justice CoIERiDGn said, he had great and sincere respect for Sir John Dodson's opinion, but he thought the statute was quite clear upon the point. It was common learnug that if a statute gave an appeal from an inferior court the right of appeal must be regulated by the statute. The few first lines of the 15th section showed that there were only two cases where there could be appeals, and the court which liad pronounced the present judgment was one of those two courts from the decision of which an appeal lay, It was contended at first that this was not a judgment bythe bishop; that it wasnot pronounced in the court of appeal of that province, but in the court of the first instance. If it was not pronounced either in the court of the bishop, nor in the court of appeal of the province, no appeal would lie. But it was clearly the intention that whatever judgment should be pronounced there should be an appeaL The Court ought to be slow to conclude that no appeal would lie. The onl difficulty
was in the construction of the 24th section, hbt ithat could be construed so as to make the courttbe court of the bisho
all the difiiculty vanished. On those short grounds he (7r. Justice Coleridge) thought the case was quite clear-that as the archbishop sat for the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the appeal was not to him (the archbishop) but to the judge of the court of appeal of the province.
hlr. Justice WioramAN said, that under the statute there were two courses which the bishop might pursue. He might send the case at once by letters of request, under the 13th section, to the court of appeal, which would be the court of appeal of the province, and it would beheard in the Arches Court; or, if he determined to exercise the
3srisdictionhimnsel±; thle appeal wouldl then be to the archbihhop, and it wouldI be heard before the judge of the AMi.hes Court. The difficulty in this case arois fiomn thle vwords of the section, which said the.appea'I should he "1to the archbishop -" buLt it was clear that that mieant thea coast of 'appeal of the province in -which sir John D&ldson presided. If the case had beenL heard by the bisloepof the tdiocems himself there would have been no difficulty in thje case, and the appeal would have been heard 'by the Dean of the Arches; but it so happened that the bishop was an intertestd pat,and; therefore, the 24th section applied. The, archbishop did not s!t under that section as a provincial, but as a diocesan judge.
Mr. Justice CIiOMPTO?rN said, he thought the mandamus ought to issue, int order that the question might be0 put on the record, and that the parties mnight take the question, if they thought proper, to the highest court. His Lordship agreed with the rest of the Court in the construction put on the statute, and that this writ ought to iss-ae as a mesas of enforcing the right given by the statute.
Lord CA±sELLnu said, he was glad to have had the assistance of the two learned Doctors who had attendedI to argue the cae.
Rule absolute for a mandamus.

(Sitna i,i finram
jar. JJASHNT moved to set aside an award made under a judge's order of submission, whereby the action was referred to the final arbitrament of 12 parties, six to be named by each party to the cause, or their umpire, who was to be chosen by the arbitrators before they entered upon the reference, it being part of the order that the costs of the cause, reference, and award should abide the event. The action was for slandering the plaintiff in his character of a farmer, and the defendant pleaded " Not gilty," and a plea justifying a part of the words, to which there was a demurrer. The 12 arbitrators, having appointed an auctioneer as their umpire, proceeded to hear the cause, and finally made their award, whereby they ordered the action to be forthwith discontinued and stayed; and, as to the costs, they directed each party to pav his own costs of the cause and reference, and divinded those of the award between them. It was now objected that this award was bad, because it was not final and exceeded the powers of the arbitrators, who had no authority to order a
isEcontinuance, or to make any disposition whatever as to the costs. It was also submitted that the award was bad on the face of it, as it didc not show that the time originaly limaited had been enlarged by thAe arbiitrators, and by endorsment under their hands, as required by the order. The award recited a " due extension," but it miht be, as was indeed the fact, though there was no proof of it now before the Court, that the time had been enlarged by the umpize, and he, it was contended, had no power to do any act whatever until the arbitrators had differed.
The COURT.-As to the last point, we will presume in favour of the award that the time bas been duly enlarged, in the absence of proof to the contrary. There will therefore be no rule on that ground, but it may go on all the others.
Rule nui8 accordingly.
hnv TRIAL PAPER, BRowNy V. FOSTR.
This was a rule to set aside a verdict for the defendant and for a new trial, on the ground that the late Chief Justice of the Common Pleas had misdirected the jury, had received improper evidence, and had irregularly conducted the trial, inasmuch as he had caused a barrister to be examined as to a particular fact, which he could oniy have acquired any knowledge of by reason of his having acted as the counsel for the plaintiff in the cause on the occasion of a criminal charge being preferred against him. The rule was also supported by affidavits, setting forth that the plaimtiff was surprised at the trial by the line of defence adopted by the defendant.
The action was for the malHious prosecution of the plain. tiff on a charge of embezzlement. When the case was first before the magistrates the prosecutor produced a bookc, 'into which it was the duty of the plaintiff to enter all zeceipts, and, though that book was seen and examined by the magistrates and mr. Ellars, the counsel for the prisoner, there was no discovery then made of any entry of the sum in question. A remand then took place, the prisoner being at liberty, and having in his possession a key which.gave access to the place in which the book was ordinarily kept. When the prisoner was brought up on the second occasion the book was again produced and banded about, and then, on behalf of the prisoner, there was pointed ou t an entry of the transaction in a particular page where if it had existed on the first inquiry It could not well have escapd observation. UponthislMr.Ellarshanded up the book to t e magistrates, who, after the prosecutorhad said that he ould oniy account for the circumstance by suppos. ng that the entry had been made by some one since the iat Inquiry. dismissedthe charge, and therefore the present action was brouight. During the trial it appears that Mr. Ellars was present, and, as the case entirely turned upon the question whether the entry was a genuine or fraudulent one, the connexion of that gentleman with the inquiry before the magistrates was openly spoken of. Just as the case for the defendant was about to close the Chief Justice retired for a few moments, and on his return said, " There is a gentleman in court, it seems, Mir. ElUars, who-must know all about this point. I have consulted with my brother Cresswell, and he agrees with me that there is no objection to Mr. Ellars beng examined." His Lordship then inquired of Mr. Elars whether he had any objection to state wbat he knew on the subject of the state of the book on the first hearing, and that gentleman havin" replied that he was ready to give his evidence, the Chief Yustice directed him to be called, and Mr. 11acaulay, the counsel for the defendant, conducted the examination, which was not objected to by the counsel for the plaintiff, who in his turn cross-examined Mr. Ellars, the effect of whose evidence was that he believed the entry was not in the book on the first hearing. In this state of things the Chief Justice told the jury that the evideuce of Mr. Ellara was conclusive en the subject, and at the close of thesumuming up the jury folund a verdict for the defendant.
Mr. MACAuLAY (with whom was Ar. Field) now appeared to show cause against the rule for a new trial, which went to raise the important question whetber, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, the Chief Justice bad irregularly caled upon and allowed a learned counsel to disclose to the jury a fact which had come to his knowledge while engaged in the defence of his client, the plaintiff in this cause, and tvas therefore a privileged communication.
The CnmxF BARoN.-Any fact of which a counsel is aware and is patent to his own senses which he may prove, and I tbink ought to prove.
Mr. biAULAur&y then entered upon the question of surprise, contendingthat the line of defence alluded to-namely, that the entry had been foisted into the book between the two hearings, was distinctly shadowed out during the progress of the case, and was not a matter to justify the Court sn sending down the case for a new triaL
The Ci BARON.-We will hear the other side.
MIr. M§LLnTro for theplaintigf.-The learned ChiefJustice was in error in calling upon Mr. lllars to go into the witness-box, and putting him upcu the counsel conducting the cause as a witness. At all events, the gentleman in question ought not to have allowed himself to go into the box and to give evidence of a fact destructive of the case of his former client, his knowledge of that fact having been acquired during the discharge of his duty as counsel for that client. There ought always to prevail the strongest scruple on the part of a barrister against the adoption of the course taken by this gentleman, who, if he knew that there was no entry on the first hearig and could not be mistaken on that fact, had committed the gross impropriety on the second occasion of handing up to the bench a book with a false entry in it, and claiming the benefit of that entry for his client.
The C1IEF BARoN.-Without entering into that question, it is possible that Mr, Ellars may have thought he was bound not to expose his client when before the magistrate by abandoning him on the discovery of a false entry; but when he sees that cLent turn his shield into a weapon of offence, and bring an action against the prosecutor, I can well imagine that he may then conceive It to be his duty to come forward and speak the truth, though he thereby de-
nounces his client.
Mr. Myi.xo.-Still his conduct in adoptin:g the book was most improper and indefensible. As to the uestion whether his evidnce involved the disclosure of tha which was privileged and ought to have been held secret by him, it was a fact acquired by him while searching a book in the progress of his client's defence and for the benefit of that client. The privilege once created is for al thune, and can never be put an end to accept bythe client. Then, as to the effect given to this gentleman's evidence, the Chief Justice put it to the jury as conclusive, and because he acquired his knowledge of the contents of the book on the irst hearing as the counsel for the prisoner, whereas, if his evidence wasadmissibleatall, it wasno more conclusive than that of any other witness in the cause. A.sto the affidavits it was contended that on them a clear case of surprise had been made out.
Mr. BrTrEsTon followed on the same side.
The CHiEp B3Roy.-I am of opinion that this rule ought to be discharged. As to the defence, that was clearly suggested on the cross-examination of the plaintiff and his witnesses, and as to the other grounds on which the rule was moved, I think they are equally free from doubt. lhe fact disclosed by Mr. Ellars on his examination, that he believed the book did not contain an entry of the sum the prisoner was charged with having embezzleda when first he saw it, was not a privieged communication from his client. The book was produced not by the client, but by the prosecutor, and the counsel for the prisoner had no more means of -knowing its contents than any other person had who was present and saw it. It may be that when Mr. Ellars saw the entry on the second occasion, he thought heoughtnotto disclose his knowledge of its former state, as it might prejudice his client. It would have beenas well if he had abstained from advocating the cause of that client even to the extent of handing up the book. In my opinion, the conduct of Lord Truro on such an occasion was worthy of praise and imitation. That learned judge, when at the bar, was retained to defend a man who, after a consultation, coifessed to his attorney thathewas guilty. That factwas made!snown
to I.rdTruro, who, feeling' tibthis. client could OnIy be defended by imputing peoury to a witness, at once said, "I 'will not defie my mind by advocating suci a case"-and declined to hold the brief, recommen'ding that it should be intruted to fOsne ethaer counsel 'who was ignorant of the confession. Be the conduct of r. El3a. what it majon this point, I think the Chief Justice 'was justified incallizig R~on him, and he was justified in speakdng the truth at the trial, andl th&t it was bis duyt os.Th ueogt therefore, to be discharged. t o Teiieogt
Mfr. BaronL ARM~.~ 'was also of thaLt opinion. There was no doubt of the admiMibility of the evid-nce of Mr. Ellars, as he was not called upon to disclose an5 thing which had been communicated to him by bEs client, bat rather
bhat he had seen and observed with his own eyes as to the condition and contents of a book produced by the prosecutor. Mr. Macaulay adopted hn an his witneus, and if any one could complain of the conduct of the Chief Justice it was he, as Mr. Ellats -might ha-ve given evidence against the defendant's interests, As to Mr. Ellar.'s conductvidntinned the learned judpe), I own I think somethig ought th be said in his favour, and that he was not altogether opeu to all the reprehension bestowed upon him by ar. t elor. What was he to do? He wasjin cort, and 'was suddenly caled upon by the Chief Justice to say whoether he had any objection to be examined, and that afte taconsultation 'with another jtdge eminent for the delicacy of his sense of bononrad rssional etiquette. I coufessitiavery difficuttsa'htouttoeneb the counsel so situated. Itiki eylkl,hdIbe he! that, .eting ontopro hmret n iligt i pulse,lshould havedn sh i,to ti eypoal

lin,and it he knew when he handed up the book that it colntined a false entry, no observation can possibly be too strong for such conduct.

H6lland was stated to be incapable of coming to this court, not being able to pat his feet to the ground. He was, however, this morning seen at Sereants'-inn, making an aflidavit. It was remarkable that bankrupts, although professedly without means, had always the asistance of the most ae solicitors or counsel.
The Cosv,issxoRs observed that the circumstance had been noticed by himself.
Mr. LucAs protested, with great warmth, against the insinuation of Mr. Roy. Bankruats in the position of his cHient might almoet be eg ar=d as before a criminal tribunal- for if Mr. Roy's opposition meant anything, it was that Ifthe parties to these bils ought to be subjected to indictment for conspiracy. At the highest crimhinal tribunal such was the feeling on the point that if the accused was wthout legal advice the sherift would generally order counad to be retained on his behalf. If the aid of counsel was thus thought necessary where a jury intervened between the accused and the judge, it must be more so in a court like this, where there was no jury, but only a judge.
Mr. Aiony having stated that the assignees had instiuted inquiries wth a view to ascertain it any fraud had been committed,
His HONOUs.'ordered an adjournment for a month, protection tobe granted for one week only, unless the promised accounts should be duly filed.

ArLewis of Ely-plaeo, who appeared for the defencs, aseed under what act the Conrt intended to take the
B6t EabDON said, inder the 3d section of the 4th clause, 16th and 17th of Victoria,
The evidence, wich occupied some time, having been concluded,
Mr. BEA3)ON said,-I have given every attention to this case, and have attentively read the act of Parliamaent, as it ismy duty to do, and I have heard all that Mr. Lewis has been able to urge on the subject. I quite agree with Mr. Lewis that the two cases of Iteeve and Bass differ. Reeve has comnitted no act to show that he participated ia the business of the place. He has been seen there on two occasions, and, thiough I may have a moral opinion about the matter, Iam bound to say there is nothing to show that he
was conducting the business of the house. With regard to Bass, if the witness- Ernsting is to be believed at all, it was distinctly stated by himh that he hadi men Bas onx three occasions in the house, and on one occasion deliver a ticket toa person of the same description as the ticket which the witness received from the ma ager when he ramade a bet. It has therefore been shown satisfactorily that when persons have come to the house the defendant has been seen to write tickets, and tocleliver those tickets to such persons. Now,the lawlIap£rehend isthis-that tI.e judge or the magistrate who may ear the case mnust be satisfied that the house in aeeston iss usedfor orpo~s o betingand or mneybets, and. that suchhous wasso ued a'thetimereferedto inL the evidene~ hatvertrae my b carie onatanother time.
Mr.I,eis.It ustbe how tht te huseon hepar-
ticuar dy inquesion as ued a a bttusage~
sl own; but then a house may be used as a betting-honse one dav and a cigaz or coal-dealer's another; but still the house for the purposes of the act would be what. is called a liettinghouses It does not follow that in this house- it sloul be 3necessary to show that batting took place on a particularday-it d not meatter whether the party trans. aets bettng usliness on that day, provided it eLi be shown froma other circumstances that it is right to infer that' tho hiouse is a betting-bouse. I differ fronm Mr. Lewis with respect to whAt he said about persons going into the house and looking atthelbetting boards, Mr. Lewis did not think that afforded any proof of the house being a betting-house. But when persons go into a shop, whether it be tailor's, haberdasher's or shoemaker's, they do so be~.as h e
the speca articles displayed--this distinguishes the busi. ness of the shop. And what is it that the police see when they enter the ouse in Jermyn-street? They see boards displayed on which are written " Odds laid on the Double Ind Treble Events- odds for first, second, ard third horse in handicap races, Chester Cap race, hurdle race, and other races, with the dates when the race is to be run. A11 these particulars ara written oa a board, and hung in a conspicuous place in the shop. But that is not all. Books are found within the house carefully kept, in which the names of persons who laid wagers and betted the different odds are entered. In one of the books was an entry respecting the Gipsy Queen to run for the Oundle Stakes, vhich corresponds with the ticket produced by the witness Ernsting. There were several other circumstances detailed, all of which go to show that this place is used as a betting house. Can I for a moment say that this place was not kept for betting formoney on horse-races? And whatever may be said about the evidence of the witness Ernsting not being corroborated,, the fact of his having laid a bet with somne person in the house on the Oundle Stakes stands uncontradicted and confirmed by circumstances. Everything confirms the belief that this place is used as a betting-house, and I can come to no other conclusion than that the place is ket open as a temptation to the public to come and bet unon races. This part of the case does not touch Reeve, but it affects Bass, who was seen in the place several times, osensibly conducting the business He was seen writing and deIivering tickets, and, though the witness did not see what the writing was on the face of the documents, be states the resembled the betting ticket that he received -vhen he made a bet. After this evidence, can I say that Bass was not there for the purpose of conducting7 the busness of the place? Common sense isin favour of this viewv, and the act of Parlament is not stirained in taking that view. I shall inlict a fine of 25, or tv,o months' imprisonment on
Mr. Lewis.-We Shall appeal
Mr. Bxsnox.-YoN will have every facility afforded you for doig so. The other defendant will be discharged.
The next case was against William Bay, of No. 12, Little Newport-street.
In this case the defendant was found on the premises, and admitted living there. This was confirmed yesterday by the landlord.
Mfr. B.Anor went over the evidence given on the pre'sous examination, and said, 'when betting cards were found about the place and betting books discovered, it vas impoesible to fin stronger evidence of the place beimg used as a betting-house.
Mr. Lewis hoped the magistrate would be satisfied vith inflicting the same amount of fine as in the previous cae. The act of Parliament 'was not intended to ruin a man, but to pust down the betting-houses.
nr. B te take v. distction in this case. The defendant not only kept a betting-house, but carried on two other busineses. Such cases must be marked, and he should ill discharge his duty if he did not put on such a pnalty as would carry out the purpose of the law. He should fine the defendant 501, or four months' imprisonment.
There was another case against Thorpe, the alleged keeper of the betting-house in Jermyn-street, but, owing to the lateness of thehour, it was postponed for a week.
For the poor-box, 101. from "L. Hl," andll. from "J. B.," have been received.
MAtyLino2n-John Hughes and John Greenwood were brought up on remand, and placed at the bar beforo Mr. Bftovorox, charged with having at an early hour on the morning of the 14th inst. been found on the premiees of Mr. John Arnold, 39, Westbourne-park-villas, Paddington, their object being, as believed, that of committing a burglary.
The particulars of what previously transpired have already appeared in 7ac Times, and it will be remembered that a most desperate struggle took place between the prisoners and the police, by whom they were after a deperate resstanee captured and conveyed to the stationhouse, where the charge against them was tak-en by Inspector Grant.
The inquiry excited considerablo interest in consequenco of the frequent cases of burglary lately perpetrated at Notting-hull and Paddington, and some gentlemen living in the locality were p resent during the hearing of the case
Mr. PeU, the chief clerk, read over the whole of the evidence which had been given upon the first examination.
In reply to the Magistrate as to whether the nrisoners were known to the poUce,
Sergeant Potter, 16 D, said, that in the January sessions of the Central Criminal Court in 1855 Greenwood had been tried for felony and convicted.
Inspector Grant handed to Mr. BRoUGEroi a letter which had been sent to the Paddington station and was addressed to his worship. It was thus worded:-
-January 27, 1857.

Mr. BaOuUGUroN said, he hoped that publicty would be given to the letter, reflecting as it did peat credit upon the police ior the tact they evinced in the affair.
Theprisoners were each sentenced to threemonths'for being found on the premises with the intention of burglriouslyenteringtberein,and inaddition thereto theywerecomTnitted for assaults oa the constables-Hughes for assaulting Soer, 289 D; Parsons, 182 D; and Johnston, 385 A-a wonth in each case; and Greenwood, for his attacks upon Doble, 147, and lester, 146 D, was in each of the cases sentenced to a month, making, in tbe whole, Six months' imprisonment for Hughes and two months' for Greenwood.
WoRsisr.s,sEnr.-Henry Burrows, 50, Elizabeth Bnrrows, his wife, and John Hawkins Brown, 15, were charged before Mr. D'EYscourT with being concerned in the following robbery .-
Claik, 220 N.-From information I received of a plate robbery having been committed at Dalston, I last nihht, accompanied by police-constable Cowan, went to o. 3, Devonshire-place, Shoreditch, at 12 o'clock, and, having knocked, the door was opened by Burrows in his nightshirt. HEl asked what I wanted, and I said, " Why, I want you, and you may consider yourself in custody for stealing a quantity of plate from Park-road, Dalstou," to which he made no answer. The street-door opens into a room, in which I found the other two prisoners in bed, of which there was but one in the room. I told the woman she must also consider herself in custody, and asked who occupied the room to which she replied that she did, and had brought the two men home with her. I told them they must get up and dress while I searchedthe room, and while I was discovering some duplicates, but not relating to this property, Cowan took up part of the flooring, and underneath it I found a broken spoon, on which the woman said, " Well, don't make a noise about it, we must suffer for what we have done ;" and, on our way to the station the prisoner Burrows said, "The boy and me did the robbery, the woman knows nothing about it."
Cowan, 77 N.-While the lst witness was searching the place I perceived that a part of the flooring had been newly raised, and on taking this piece uy I foand a hollow place in the earth, in whichI disovered tne whole of the articles I now produce*(a number of dessert spoons, knives and forks, &c.) I took Brown, who declared he knew nothing whatever about the robbery.
William Crockett, 17.-I live in Seward-street with my father, who is a working jeweller. On Saturday afternoon, at 4 o'clock, Brown cAme to me and said, " I want to see you at the. coffeehouse you go to." I told him I would be there at 6, and I was so, and saw him there. He said, " I want yon to sell some silver spoons for me." I said, " Yes, i 'll sell them," and he went out with me, and, 'whie going along, he pulled from his pocket about nine silver spoons and some forks, which he gave to me - and we went to the house of MIr. Reeves, a refiner in &oswell-street, where Isoldthe silverfor,31. Os. 6d.,at the rate of 4s.9d. per ounce. Brown was waiting for me; I gave him the money, and he returned me 3s. for myself.
By Mr. D'EyvscouRT.-I have seen Brown at that coffeehouse before. I didsuspect there was something wrong. Four of the poons were like those produced, and the teaspoons werelikethe broken one now shown me. Brown said the spoons came from Hackney, and the refiner wrote the amount on a piece of paper, whieh I also gave to Brown.
Mr. Reeves, the refiner.-On Saturday last I bought of the last witness a bar of silver, and-
Mr. D'EYINoCusT (surprised).-A bar of silver?
Witness.-Yes; it weighed 12 oz. 15 dwts.; the bar is now produced.
Wr. D'EYNcouRT ordered the witness into the clerks' office, and recaUed the boy Crockett, who added,-All the spoons I took were broken when I got them from Brown. v en I took them to Mr. Reeves I put two before him, and sad, ' I want these melted for my lather ; there is a good lot of it." He said he would melt it, put the pot on the nr4 ad .- en gav hi- all- I- had, an he put it

(It was hee disovered this bar driday not 10h ol2oz and,ts. on whichd Mr. Reeves said it musot be a mistake,wentth o heis house,returned with sueNeither br,and continued,) I have purcased both gold and silver oftheboye for the lst noie or ten years.
Mr. dYE srico oTtYour conduct was certainly not altogether without suspicion.
M1rs. Susan Miles, 'wife of a gentleman residing at ParkroaLd, Dals-ton, said,-Yesterday morning I missed from my bedroom a large quantity of plte, consisting of tablespoons, teaspoons, saltspoons, desert knves and forks, nuterackers, gola plated sugarspoons, and othor articles, and the siver
a cls p o it those stolen. I cannot tel wht dy o tie teyerestoen,butall were safe on hous onSatuday whch ecitd m susicins,but
Neither prisoner offered any defence, and all were committed for tht comipletion of the evidence.
CLmxiixNw3ar..-George Hicknott, aged 26, a dirty. looking fellow, deiscribed on the chaLrge-sheet as a shoemaker, residing at No. 2, Northumberlsuo.Placee Clerlcen'well, was placed at the bar on a warrnt before M1r. Coii1u1 charged with "unlawfully andI maliciolusly assult.
inj and beating Mary Hunt," an infant only 16 monhshf
The evidence showed that the greatest brutality had baen used bythe prisoner sgainst the poor infant, and in many parts of the case the persons in court expressed their disgust at his unmanly andtrael conduct by hissing audibly.
Mr. George oss, of 13, Weymouth-terrace, West; Hack. nyrod relieving offlcer of Sihoreditch parish, sid,-Last Wedneay w!eek the motheor with the child in her arms, ap. Iifed to me for re3ef, at the same time stating that she had fornerly resided in thig parish. Finding that the child appeared to bo in a dying tate I at once admitted it, without making inquiry, and when it was examined it was foand to be eovered witit bruies anud marks, as if it ha4ebeen =t with a cane or stick; its stomach was one mass of sores. and the back had nearly the whole of t'he skin off-in fact, it appeared more like a skinned rabbit than a human being. (Sensation.) The mother inL a day or two afterwards ap.
peared before the trustees, and thev having heard the facts directed that t he prisoner th btake, before the magi*. trate. A summons was then taken out against the defendant, but he "got out Of the wa," and in consequence a warrnt was granted for his apprehension. Since, bs child has been in the workhoume it has improved wonderfully, but although it has been wel treated the onark, of the violence that it has rceivedl cre sathl visible upon its boay. The surgeon to whom the child Was fge t shown gave the folrowing certificate -h

(Sensation.) From the heild's ppehnee it seemed to him as it the chld was dying, it wasa in so deplorable a state.
Mr. Ross here remarked that he was in the course of his inquierie called uPon to see many shocking sights, but he never saw a worse one thsa this.
Mary Hunt said, she was the mother of the child, and about seven wmyks ago aue bed no work. The defendant said he would tale the ch*l and pay his raoter for its s
port. A young woman told her that her child was very Sh
and tpon gein to the room and asking the prisoner hew her child got into that hocking state, he replied that a woman had got dmnk and had droppedthe child on the fsre. She found other bruises and wheals, which the prisoner said he had done with a cane. (Sensation.) The marks are not gone yet. (Hsses.t)
lar. Cordin asked the prisoner whsat he had to say in justification, mitigation, or excuse of such conduct?
The prisoner, who treated the mpatter inr a very cool sort of way, saitpr-Well, I own that the marks on the child's back I did, buvt it was only with a thin cane. (Hibssno) I was holding the child to warm it, when it jumped out of mly arms, and fee on the blazing fire. The other markg are net bruses; they are only scalcds.
Mr. CoRsu= asked Hlunt whether she had affiliated the child to the defendant ?
Hunt h lied in the negative. The prisoner sometimes gave her d a2-week and sometime nothing.
mr. CoT tix addresed the prisoner as follows --You had no hnsiness to take the child from its mother unless yon were going to succour and treat it properly. Youa knew, accordheg to your own statement, that the person to whom you gve the chila was a drunkcard, and yen had no right to trst her with its care. If you, taking the child from its mother, neglected to take proper care of it, or neglected to supply at weth proper feed or nourishmient, and the child died, you would have to take the consequences. Thero can be no doubt that if the child had not been taken to the woxkchouae it would have 'been sacrificed.

iPRESO'2ITS PHILIP II.*
(ContAnued from he nimes of January 12).
J1r the life of Philip there is nothing so interesting as those incidents which belong less to history than to biography. The war in the Netherlands was indeed a great war, in which the combatants were true heroes, the exploits were marvellous, and the issue glorious. But Philip had even less to do wFith that terrible conflict than the injured husband of Helen had to do with the tale of Troy divine. Had Menelaus remained at home in his Spartan palace while friend and kinsman went across the £Egean to fight his battle through 10 bloody years, he would have acted the part of Philip. His were the armies, his were the revenues; his were the mandates ; but they were his only in name. His regents governed, his ministers planued, his deputies fought, while far away in the ancient Alcazar of the Moorn in Madrid he read their despatches and criticized the grammar. To him belongs the infamy of their tiaisactions, because he supplied the motive of bigotry; he decreed the fire and the faggot, he scorned the life and liberty of his subjects, he grasped at the honour and he accepted the responsibility. But it is easy to command what it may be difficult to accomplish, and Philip has all the disgrace of an evil design without the merit of brilliaut action, and without the glory of successful achievement. The history of his family is in every way more notable than that of hiis kingdoms, in so far as he was concerned in their management. It is a history full of amusing incidents and gorgeous pageants, curious traits and mysterioils gossip, such as adnirably suit the tenour of Mr. Prescott's narratire. They are so admirably adapted to his pen that, after the account of Charles V., by far the most interesting chapters in these volunes are devoted to she romance of Philip and his four wives.
His first wife was Mary of Portigal. The young Prince was in his 16th year, with a heritage so magnificent that he was esteemed the best match in
iirope. His father proposed an alliance with the French Sovereign, but he preferred his cousingerman, the Infanta of Portugal. She accepted, as a matter of course, and the Duke of Aledina Sidonia, ihe wealthiest of the Andalusian nobles, and the same wvho afterwards led the armada against England, was despatched to conduct her with all honour to Salamanca, where the marriage was to be solemnized. Some idea of the splendour of his retinue may be formed from the fact already alluded to, that the mules which bore the superb litter of the Dnke were shod with gold. Thus attended, the Princess entered Salamanca, a magnificent procession going forth to meet her. Philip, too, curious to see his bride, sallied out for five or six miles with the cavalcade, in the disguise of a huntsman-a slouched hat on his head and a gauze mask on his face. Thus he mingled unobserved in the crowd by the side of the Infanta, and, makilg his own remarks, accompanied the procession during the five hours which it occupied. One can fancy the boyfor he was a mere boy-relicving the formality of their first interview by the disclosure of what he had done, and all the little uirlish surmnises of the Princess as to which of the cavalcade, which of the disguised huntsmen was he. On the following evening they were married, while dance and revel, banquet, bullfiglt, and tournay for a whole week celebrated their union and proclaimed their joy. It was a joy, however, that was not to last. In less than two years the Princess gave birth to a son, the celebrated Don Carlos, whose unhappy history has furnished so much matter to the dramatist. The mother died a few days afterwards. In the absence of her attendants, who for the good of their souls had gone to witness an a tto dii fl, she for the good of her body ate voraciously of a melon, and the result was fatal. This little gastronomical event is enougli to prepare us for the gormandiziing propensities of her son, who Ol one occasion is said to have eaten lGlb. of fruit, including four of grapes, at a single sittinag.
Philip was in no hurry to wed a second time, and when he did wed it was for anything but love. He sacrificed himself like Isaac, to adopt the simile of a Spanish historian, on the altar of filial duty, and married a woman 11 years older than himself, wvho had originally been betrothed to his fathernone other than our Bloody Mary. Katharine of Arragon, the mother of this Princess, was the aunt of Charles V., and on the occasion of his paying a visit to England, when a very young man, the Queen induced him to betroth himself to her daughter-then only six years of age. The youthfuil Emperor, however, was unable to wait for his English cousin, and at the end of five years he gave his hand to Isabella of Portugal. Mlary was at this time scarcely old enough to resent with any violence the desertion of her Imnperial lover, if she felt it at all. Charles always remained her friend, and whlen shie ascended the tbrone formed the scheme of handing her over to Philip. Were it not for his age and increasing infirniities, lie declared that lie should not hesitate to propose himilself as her suitor. The next best thiing Was to ofier her the person dearest to his heart-his son, the Prince of Astarias. His son, thi Prince of Asturias, however, had a nuld to ally himself a second time with the Royal House of Portugal, and left all the cares of courtship to his father. In fact, Alary was wooed and won, the game of coquetry was played out, the consent of all parties gained, and the ratifications of the marriage treaty exchanged long before Philip had written one line to his mistress or sent her a single token of his regard. Charles, it may be supposed, had enough to do with a lady who was both a coquette and a prude in behalf of a Prince who was distasteful to the English nation and who cared not a fig for its Queen; but lie plied her with despatches, beleaguered her with ambassadors, and at last, as with the head of Aledusa, fixed her with the portrait of Philip painted by Titian. Thus wooed at third hand, the lady graciously surrendered; the Prince crossed over to England, and it was deterniined that the miiarriage knot should be tied at WVinlchester. Here, as at Salamanca, gorgeous processions were arranged, in wvhich the blilliant gold and crimson livery of the Spanish attendants minglod with tbhe more sober green and white of the English Courtand the scarlet robes of mayor and aldermeni. The Bishop of Winchester conducted the Prince to tlie residence of his bride, where the Royal pair passed an hour together anid it was observed that Philip gave a most liberal construction to the English custom of salutation, kissing the women all round, maids and matrons, without distinction. Next day being the festival of St. James, the patron saint of S;ain, the marriage was solemnized in the cathedral, Philip appearing in a dress provided by his Queen, -of white satin and cloth of gold, glittering with pearls and precious stones; Mary, in a dress of similar material, eked out by vay of delicate coiitrast with bright red slippers and a mantle of black velvet. From 'Winchester they passed to Windsor, and finally to Hampton Court. where, in comparative retirement Mary could lavish her fondness on a husban d who never cared for her and very soon got heartily sick of her. " lie well deserved the tenderness of his wife," writes the Venctian ambassador, " for he w'as tlhe miost loving and the best of Lusbands." But Mr. Prescott very properly suggests ethat the halian in Isis estimate of the best of hUsbandis adopted thie liberal standard of his own couatry. With all her accomplishments, lier Latin, hew mlusic, and lser ncedlewvork, a tough and :bony old woman, short of sigh3t and long of tongue, diseased in body and gloomy in miind, could have no great charxns for aniy man, and Philip's only
.conpensatron swas the prlspect of an heir that might confirm lhis power in England. lt was very speedily annGunced to the Parliament that the state of Wer Majesty's heldth afforded sucl a riospect, andt the Comiwnis inmnediately passed an act authorizing PIhilip to aisumoe the regency in case -of the Queeu's demise. The precaution wYas needless; t':e syniptoms contintled to be fxvourable, anid at 1,ngthl thte time drewv nigh wlhen the4desixes of Prince and pleople were to be gratifiedL As the Queen lies in agony at Hampton Court, and th1e ntiion Wais ini suspense, a pretty little scene is enacted which gives one a good idea of Philip. He movesi aoig tho cortidors of the palace until he comes to the casem(int of Lady Magdalen Dacre, one of the Queen's maids of honour, on wvhom he ha3 cast his eye. The lad v is in her bower, as the king 'perceives, and puslhig, open the casement he gets in as much as h:s arm-but no more; the Lady MSgdalen givCs him a rap over the knuckles that maikes him withdraw it smartin int double quick tim,>. Queen Mary's maids ol honour are chaste as nuss, and bold as
Amazons. Meantime to bear the tidings of a Royai birth to the towns of England and the Courts of Europe, horses were all saddled, messengerswere all ready, guns were all loaded, and letters were all written :-" Whereas it hath pleased Almighty God of His infinite goodness to adde unto the great number of other His benefites bestowed upon us, the glaclding of us with the happy deliverie of a Prince, &rc." The bells of Antw-erp rang merrily, bonfires were lighted, great was the flow of ale, and loud were the huzzas of the English sailors. Te Deumn was sung in the churches, and the child was described in the sermons. " But for all this great labour," says Holinshed, " for their yoong maister long looked for coming so surely into the world, in the end appeared neither yoong maister nor yoong maistress, that any man to this day can hear of." The Queen's disorder was a dropsy and all her hopes were ilusive. Philip immediately took his departure for Brussels, where he had the double satisfaction of losing his wife and gaining aa empire. He was summoned to the abdication of Charles, and notwithstanding the pining of poor Mary, he took good care never again to see her, except during a hurried visit which he paid to this country in the hope of dragging England into his continental wars.
It was in his war with France that the tidings came to Philip of the death of Mary, on the 17th of November, 1558 ; and now in his 32d year he was in a quandary with regard to the choice of his next wife. Should he propose to his sister-in-law, Elizabeth of England, or to his intended daughter-inlaw, Elizabeth of France ? He tried both. Unwilling to lose England, then beginning to give some promise of its future greatness, the Royal widower offered his hand to its Virgin Queen before her sister had been a month in Westminster Abbey. She coquetted, and he grew impatient. He argued that if he could not obtain the Queen with his addresses, he could conquer England with his armada. Many years afterwards he made the attempt 'with an armada that cost Spain 40,000,000 ducats, 20,000 men. and 100 ships, and how far his war was more successful than his courtship we all know. For the present, he turned to the other Elizabeth, better known inder the Spanish form of the name, Isabella; and, as formerly, to please the Emperor, he had married the betrothed of his father, so now, to please himself, he determinied to marry the betrothed of his soni. This fair girl was iutended for Don Carlos, and was accepted by his father as one of thze articles of peace, from which she derived her title, Isabel de la Paz. She was so beautiful, according to the ancient chronicler, that no cavalier durst look on her long, for fear of losing his heart and awakening the jealousy of the King; and she was so loved that the people thronged about her when.ever she appeared in public, " et bien henreux O?t lhec reutse," are the words of BrantOme, in his quaint old French, " .Estoit celiuy ou celle cpd poevoit le sob- dire ' J'ay veie lac Reyjne.'" Well might the historian conclude that when the young Prince of Asturias gazed for the first time on his stepmother he felt anything but gratitude to the father whio had robbed him of such a bride. Philip married her by proxy in the summer following the deathof MIary, the celebrated Alva beinghisrepresentative, and these nuptials that ended in so much mystery were inaugurated with the darkest of omens. The wedding was foHlowed by a brilliant tournament in which the King of France, the father of the bride, bore aconspicuouspart. Towardsthecloseof theganies he observed the captain of his guard, a youig Scottish noble of the house of Montgomery, leaning on his lance. The King challenged the young cavalier to break it with hin for his lady's sake. They mounted and charged. It was no light encounter, but a furious shock, and the rude lance of Montgomery bursting the bars of the King's visor, laid bare his eye. 'Tlhe wound was mortal, and the nuptial song of his daughter swelled into the requiem of the King.
It was January before Philip was ready to receive his beautiful bride in his Spanish dominions. He sent the Duke of Infantado-a grand old hidalgo, wlho boasted the noblest lineage, the best library, and the finest stud in Castile-to conduct her across the Pyrenees. The Duke brought her to Guadalajara, where Philip, attended by his son, awaited her commig. Here it was that Carlos first saw her, and vowed vengeance against his father. If the young Prince gazed with rapture on the lady, she in turn gazed withctcriosityon her lord. Shegazed so intently that he disconcerted her by asking "if she were looking to see whether he had any gray hairs ?" There was, indeed, the same disparity between her and her husband as between .him and his son. He was in his 3lth year, she in her fifteenth. If Isabella was not satisfied with such companionship she was at least as happy as the boundless indulgence and attention of her husband could make her. He lavished on her those endearments which M ,ary Tudor sighed for in vain; and if dress and jewvelry could make one happy she must have been at the summit of bliss. She very rarely wore the same dress twice, and few of her robes could have cost less than 300 or 400 crowns. In the midst of it all, however, she mlLst have been solitary enough, if one may judge from the description of her mode of life. A manuscript of the time, quoted by Mr. Prewcott, describes her at dinner, attended by 30 of her ladlies. Two carved the meat, one was cupbearer, and stood by Her Majesty's chai, the rest stationed themselves round the apaLrtment, conversiulg with their gallants, who, unlike the French courtiers, kept tleir heads covered. "They were there," they said, " not to wait on the Queen, but on her ladies." After her solitary meal, Isabella retired to a chamber and passed the evening in the society of musicians and jesters. This was certainly not a brilliant destiny-to be made a (loll of. If dolls are dressed in cloth of gold every day, they are still nothing but chaff within; and if the Queen had the pleasure of a sumptuous robe every day, these robes were but the covering of an empty heart.
The stories whfich connect the fate of Isabella withl that of Don Carlos are mere fable, although it must be allowed that in the closene3s of their relationship and in the rapidity with whlichl the death of the one followed that of the other, the romancers have had tempting ground to play upon. Hers, indeed, was the sad fate to witness the violent death of her father when she became the bride of Philip, and ere she left Philip a widower to witness the still inore miserable deathl of his son. But there is no mystery about her fate and none about her life. The mystery is all about Don Carlos-his love for her, his hatred to his father, the secret of his imprisonment, and the still darker secret of his death.
Thisyoung rascal-for in spite of Royal blood and poetical fame we must call him such-had the misfo-tune to lose his mother a few davs after he was born, and to b9 thoroughly neglecteJ by his father. He was certainly a precocious little fellow, rather clever in his way, but clever chiefly as a bad boy. He was so cruel that he was known to roast hares alive in order that lie might witness their dying agonies. In a fit of passion he bit off the head of a tame snake. At a later period, howling with fury, ho attacked Alva with his poniard and his teeth, and, but for the superior strength of the Duke, 'would have killed him. He was in the habit of wearing boots larger than usual, even for that period, in order that he might stow into them a pair of pistols, and his father, to prevent mnischief,
orclerect lle boots to be made smaller. When they were brought to him he directed them to be cut in pieces and stewed, and, sendling for the unhappy bootmnaker, compelled him to swallow the horrible hash. To teach him the control of his passions, his tutor made him read ('icero's O-jices for an hour every day. It had not much effect on the young madcap, w ho, not content vwith outrages such as these, took to the society of the lowest women. and inldulged in the grossest licentiousness. It was -in anintrigue of this kind that he met with the accident which scenis to have determined his fate. He wis sent to the University of Alcala, where he had for his ecopanions his half-uncle, DonJohn, the hero of Lepanto, aind his cousin, Alexander Farnese, who afterwards proved to be the greatest captain of his age. Such companionship -was not entirely to his liking. Wi6te they were engaged in the earnest study of military tactics, he was more practically engaged in laying siege to the women. Onie night lie was rushing udowm a dark staircase in pursuit of the gardener's dauvhter, when he fell headlong five or six stairs againsl a door at the bottom of the passage, fracturing his g7. ull. Foolish boy lie was taken up invnsible, the ernemedies of the doctors were unavailing, his life was despaired of, and he only recovered as by a iniracle. Although he ultimately recovered, the injury which lie sustained seeMs to have developed the incipient madness of his blood. He became iiiore cruel and c- aY than ever, an iLwemedittblo scapegrace. He
tramped the streets of 3Madrid with a number of
young nobles Wild as himself; he attacik-ed the I citizens sword in hand; he kissed the women by force; and did not scruple to insult even ladies of rank by calling them vile names. This is the being who has been elevated by Alfieri, by Schiller, and by Lord John Russell into a sentimental young hero of tragedy. It is rather difficult to cast the halo of romance round a salow, rickety boy, with one leg longer than the other, with high shoulders, and hangdog look, and represented by the painters with one hand on a dagger, the other on a long sword, as if nature intended him for a butcher's apprentice. There is not much poetry in a youth whose affections are divided between courtesans and the pastScook, and who crams mincepies till there is nothing for it next day but blackdraught and no dinner. Lord John Russell indeed frankly admits that his hero is quite an imaginary being, but defencls the inaccuracy of his portraiture by informing us that the dramatist is not an historian. True; only in producing a historical play he is bound to show a little deference to historical fact; and it is not more absurd to exalt Don Carlos into a hero than it would be for a dramatist to paint Richard Ill. as a romantic young man of the most handsome figulre and the most gentle soul, or for an actor to personate Macbeth in a cocked-hat and full-bottomed wig, alleviating the intervals of dialogue with pinches of snuff.
WVhether the true story of Don Carlos will ever be discovered remains yet to be seen. The secret is supposed to be buried in the Vatican, in a letter which Philip is knowvn to have written in cipher to the Pope, in order to defend his treatment of the Prince, and to detail the circumstances of his death. WAie learn from the volumes of M^r. MIotley that a copy of this important letter is confidently expected by the C§ommission Royale d'Histoire, and when its contents are divulged there can be little doubt that a flood of light will be thrown on this tragic tale. What we know at present is little more than-in general terms-the madness of the Prince and the cruel treatment adopted by his father.
Don Carlos complained bitterly of his father's enmity. He was not allowed to take part in public affairs, although eagerly desiring it, and this in fact was the cause of that attack upon Alva to which we have already referred. Alva was to head the army in the Netherlands. The Prince was indignant, and when the Duke came to take leave of him vented his rage in a violent attack. Imagine the Prince of Wales, with similar precocity, expecting to command the Crimean army, and seizing Lord Raglan by the throat on the occasion of his departure for the East ! Carlos resented also the treatment of his father in the matter of his marriage. Not only had he been deprived of Izabella, his father would not let him have Isabella's younger sister, who had been proposed by her mother, Catherine de Mledici. And far more than this, not only had Philip refused this mateh, he had indefinitely postponed another to which he had given his consent-a union with his cousin Anne of Austria, which her Tmperial parents had been most anxious to complete. Over these wron-s the Prince brooded, and father and son passed each other in silence day after day in the same palace. Vhat was
to be done ? At one time the uppermost I thought in the mind of Carlos was to assassinate his father. He told his confessor that he meant to kill a man, and when cross-questioned admitted that his father was the victim. Then he seemed to change his mind. He would fly from these scenes, and from the hateful presence of the King; he would fly to Austria, where he would be received with open arms by Anne and her parents. While he was thus meditating escape he was seized. He lay in bed with sword and dagger at his side, a musket loaded with two balls within his reach,'his door cariouslyfastened. Spite of every precaution, the king entered the room silently in the middle of the night and surprised the Prince in his sleep. He treated him as a madman. " Yoiur Majesty! I am not mad, but you drive me to despair." Amid the sobs and entreaties of his son, he took the audirons and every bit of furniture by which the young man might injure himself out of the room, and left him with a guard. His chamber then became his prison, and Philip immediately wrote to the Emperor of Austria to break off the marriage with Aine, and to announce that his son was a prisoner for life. No intercession could alter him-the prayers of his wife, his sister, his aunt, his uncle, only made him more determined. His half brother, Don John of Austria, came to him in mourning, and he was ordered to doff it. Isabella went weeping for days, and she was ordered to stop it. No mourning, no wveeping for a volatile youth cut off in the midst of his days and a doomed prisoner for life. That life, however, was not long. Philip literally murdered his son. In nraking this fearful statement, it is quite unnecessary to endorse the assertions of those who, rememboring Philip's reply to a heretic that was being dragged to the stake-" Were my son such a wretch as thou art I would myself carry the fagots to burn him," -compare these words with the letter which he addressed to his aunt, Queen Catherine of Portugal, regarding Carlos, in which he declared himself ready " to nmae the sacrifice of my own flesh and blood to God, and to prefer HWis service and the universal welfare to al other human considerations ," and who by puttilng together some further evidence of this kind are led to the conclusion of the older historians, that orders were given to strangle the young Prince wvith a towvel, or to poison his bowl of broth. This account may be true or false; Philip was quite capable of the atrocity; but as yet we have no clear evidence of the fact. All we know is, that he had the greatest aversion to his son, that lie used him most cruelly, and that the rigour of his confinement was of itself enough to extinguish a life that burnt like a flame and fed on excitement. To be iuiable even to look out of his barricaded windows, to have 12 halberdiers in the passages leading to his chamber, to have a gaunt sentinel night and day in his presence speaking not aword, carrying no message for him to or from the outer air, but watching him for ever with a cold silent eye-this last infliction the greatest of all, were tortures to a fiery nature, and drove Don Carlos to the wildest excesses. He tried to choke himself with a diamond;-that woouldn't do. He sat in cold draughts, he filled his bed with ice, he deluged the floor of his apartment with water, and walked about for hours on the cold pavement with bare feet and half naked ;-thsat wouldn't do either. Oh! for one of the audirons to knock his brains out ;-his father had taken them away. Then lie tried to starve himself to death, and went 11 days witlhoutt food ; neither wouldI this do. He went to the other extreme, and, faiIt with fasthig, de-oured a large pasty of four partridges with all the paste, washnuig the whole down with tlree gallons of iced water. At last came the death he sought. A violent clysentery put an end to his sufferings. The wild bird had dashed against the bars of Iiis cage unltil it dashed itself to death. IHe died in peace but without a friend at his side, and was buried with the Royal line of Austria, his father refusing to attend the funeral, and declining to accept condolence, but not lile Rachel who refused to be comforted because her children are no more.
Don Carlos had one kind friend who wept for him in Isabella. When he was first arrested his papers also were seized, and among these was a list of those
whom the young Prince deemed his friends and Ihis enemies, For his chlief fop he had written down his father-for his best frieLs. he had written down his stepmother. Carlos loved her society, and often spent the evenings with her, wlhile she, in turn, did all in her power to soothe him and to secure for him her sister's hand in marriage. She had now only to mourn his loss
and to pray for his soul. It was in the midst of this womanly sorrow that death came to her. Three months after the decease of Don Carlos she was cold as he. She had presented Philip already with two dauighters, and now he had hopes that he was soon to have an heir who would fill the plhce of his lost son. The Spanish physicians of that date were of the Sangrado school, and, nmisunderstanding her alment, gave her improper and too violent prescrip. tionsthatruined herhealth. Herstrengtliwas brought down; fever set in, her life was despaired of, and in the despair she gave birth to another da&ughter, w ho lived only to be baptized. The gentle m other's life was ebbing fast; she kissed the crucifix, she clasped it in her hands; she gazed lovingly on those roimd her bed, and closed her eyes in death. Yet once more she opened them to look on the Ambassador of France-her own dear France-and then they were shut for ever. An elegy on this lovely Princess, who died in her 23d year, aud whose death made many hearts in Spain sad, was the first attempt

Philip, too, was sad, for he loved the girL But he was easily consoled, and in 18 months took to himself another wife, who was none other than tlhe Anne of Austria whose marriage with Carlos he had broken off. Thus, a second time he had married the betrothed of his son. It was even said that, in order to effect this marriage, he had procured the death of Isabella, who had borne him only daughters; but there is no good ground for the suspicion. If, indeed, he was impatient for an heir at any price, he was soon gratified. His sonl was an irnbecile, who ascended the throne under the title of Philip HfI., and heralded the decay of Spanish greatness. Philip, the father, ended his days gloomily, more a monk than a king, in the Palace of the Escurial, which had been built by himself, in the form of a gridiron, for the honour of St. Lawrence, through whose aid he won the battle of St. Quentin. If the gridiron palace, instead of the symbol of St. Lawrence, be taken as a symbol of the fire, the fagot, and the red-hot irons of the Holy Inquisition, we shall not be far from the mark. Nor shall we be wrong if we take it as an indication of the dying tortures of the king, who, stretched on a bed that was a mass of filth, was burnt up ,ith the heat of his own corruption, and swollen with the worms that devoured him, like another Herod.
We have anticipated the final scene, but Mr. Prescott's narrative rests for the present with the death of Isabella. There are 30 years more of life and cruelty in Philip, half of which he passes immured in his convent palace, from which comes the unhappy breath that urges the armada to destruction on the shore of England. These are eventful years, and a rich harvest awaits the pen of the historian-all the more valuable for the descriptive historian, inasmuch asthe manners and fashions of the people do not change-dresses, dances, bullfights, all are now what they were then. The traveller has only to cross the Pyrenees, well says Mr. Prescott, to find himself a contemporary of the 16th century. The history of the past, therefore, has in Spain always a present interest, and the Queen and the Cortes that dance before us to-day are but nictures of the Queen and the Cortes that stood up to the same Spanish dance in the bygone days.

Sir, -I beg leave to correct a statement which appeared in your colamns this morning. In reference to the fire in Watling-street last evening I wish confidently to assert on the part of my fellow-workmen that it was not the police who removedl any goods, but through the united exertions of all belonging to MNr. Southgate's establishment. Great credit is due to the police in keeping order for our con. venience in removinsg. We should feel very grateful by having the above inserted, in contradiction to the former statement.

Sir,-In your report of my case in the Insolvent Debtors' Court your-reporter has inadvertently stated, I had " been driven almost mad by the misconduct of my wife." This statement has caused me the greatest anxiety, as during my Ifie I have never had to complain of one act of improp;iety on her part. Family quarrels caused a " difference of opinion,'" and that is how it should have been stated.
I am sure your sense of justice will induce you to insert this.
I have the honour to be, Sir,

THE CLOTH TRADE OF BELGIUM.-This important
THE CLOTH TRADE OF BELGIUm.-This important
branch of manufacture, which is almost entirely concentrated in the town of Verviers, made great progress from 1852 to 1855, in which latter year that town obtained a medal of honour for the productions sent to the French Universal Exhibition. The capital employed in the trade in 1852 in the arrondissement of Verviers was estimated at 112,400,000f., and in 1855 it was much greater. The number of machines employed in 1S55 in the manufactories was 153, of 2.013 horse-power. The quantity of cloth manufactured in 1852 was 200,000 pieces, of the valie of 40,000,000f., and in 1S55 374,150 pieces, of the value of 80,840,000f. Very little of the wool employed in the manufacture of this cloth was supplied by Belgiumii, but it came principally from Germany, Australia, B aenos Ayres, and,in a smaller proportion, from Russia and the Cape of Good Hope; the quantity from Spain being quite insignificant. Most of the cloth manufacturers make their purchases of wool in person at the great fairs of Germany, or at tho public sales of London. There are also public sales at Antverp, but they involve such heavy charges, either on account of the State or for the support of commercial establishments tbatmanufacturers cannot profit by them. The quantity of cloth exported was, in 1852, 775,291 kilos., of the value of 13,955,2SSf., and in 1855 it was 1,141,536 kilos., of the value of 20,517,648f. In the total of the latter year Englaud figures for93,6S5 kilos., France for 410,632 kilos., and Switzerland for 93,685 kilos. These quantities were considerably more than in 1852, but the exports to the ZoUlverein, the Netherlands, Sardinia, and the United States present a decline. As a set-off to this decline, however, Turkey, which previously to 1854 received no cloth from Belgium, had in that year 15,560 kilos., and in 1855, 18,622 kilos. It is to be remarked that most of the exports set down for France are in reality destined for the United Scates, South America, Italy, and the East. Those exported to England are abo destined for re-exportation, though clotls is now admitted free of duty into that countrv. The exports to Germany are likewice in great part destined for re-exportation by Hamburg. It is in the two Americas that Belgian manuacturers seek principally for a market, and their cloth 'here competes successfully with that of England, France, and Germany. The importance of the markets of the two Americas may be judged of from the fact that, in addition to what France, England, and Belgium sent them, the Z-.llverein, in addition to the direct exports fromn German ports, forwarded to theni through Belgium, in 185., about 1,0'0,000 kilogrammes of cloth. Some years baeck the prohibition to import cloth into Balglum was removed, and exceptiomal favours were acgcorded to the woollen manufactures of France. These measures wvere regarded with great alarmrr by a large portion of the community, but under them, the imports, which in 18.32 were only 24,430 kilogrammes, of the value of 651., 610f., only rose in 1855 to 28,50.5, of the value of 769,G3;5f, quantities, it w.ll be seen, which are quite insignificant compared with the national production. These imports were chiefly of the finer qualities, those which Belginm herself exports. Of the coarser descriptions Belgium makes scarcely any export, and the Chamber of Commerceo of Verviers explains this circumstance by the fact that those descriptions are protected from competitioni in the interior, and that " manufacturers find it more convenient to content themselves with the home market than to enter into competition with foreigners in neutral markets." These facts afford, it may be remarked cn passant, a new proof of the soundness of free trade principles. The progress made in Belgium in the spinning of wool is another proof of the like kind. Under tue pressure of competition the establishments for carding wool, whic in 1845 were only 61, rose in 1852 to 84, and were considerably more nunmerous in 1855. On the other hand, the importation of foreign yarn, notwithstanding the increase of weaving in the kin-doin, feU from 168,124 kilos., of the value of 2.017,48Sf. in 1852, to 150,864 kilos., of the value of 1,810,368., in 1855; and not only have Belgian spinners regained the ground which they had lost in the home market, but they have increased their exports of yarn from an average of 25,000 kilos. previous to 1850. to 181,796 kilos., of the value of 1.817,960f., in 1852, and 343,858 kilos., of the value of 3,438,8S0f., in 1855. What is mpre singular is that they now comete largely with those of England even in the English market. Thus. in the said exports, the quantity sent to England was in 1852 only 39,592 kilos.; but in 1855 it rose to 156,389 kilos. They also compete succesfully with the spinners of Prussia, the quantity sent tc that country having risen from 137,454 kilos. in 1852 to 172 017 kilos. in 1855.
THEB ACCIDENT TO THE PoxTr or AYE LLFErOAT. -Liv;P.poor., Jan. 28.-A meeting of the subscribers to the fund in aid of the sufferers by the recent upsetting of the Point of Ayr lifeboat, and loss of her crew, was held this afternoon at the 'Underwriters' Pooms, Mr. W. Potter occupying the chair. It was stated that the amount of subscriptions in the hands of tbe Liverpool Committee was 3,0251a 10s., including 1161. 2s. 6d. froni Manchester, and 201. from the Belfast Gaslight Company . and that other subscripSions would in all probability stil be received from London, Rhyl, Cheater, and elsewhere, so that the amount raised would exceed the sum reoqired for the present purpose. After some conversation as to the mode of action taken in similar cases, it was unanimously resolved "TLat, after providing adequately for the widows and children of the sufferdrs by the loss of the Point of Ayr lifeboat, the amount of the funds exceeding the sum required for that purpose be applied at the discretion of the coinmittee for the relief of sufferers under similar casualties."

The Falkland Islands.
THE FALKLAD ISLAvDS.
TO THE EDITOR OE THE TIMES.
Sir,--Seeing that the eligibility of the Falkland Islands for a penal settlement is being disced in your infloential paper, I take the liberty of enclosinga tiblo of the weather, taken by Captain Mackinnon when he Was second in co=mand under Captain B. J. Sulivan, who went ortt to the Falklands in the Arrow cutter, by order of the Admiralty-, for the purpose of esrveying those islands, in the jearlo38. This table I have extracted, with some remarks thereon, from a pamphlet published by L B. Mackinnon, RN., in 1840. As there is so very little known about these islands, these particulars may be interesting to the public, and perhaps you will favour them with a place in yourcolumn4 and oblige, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,

The " storm" column shows the number of days on which the gales were very heavy, but they seldom continued at their height more than a few hours. The " gale" column shows the number of dayson whioh,at some period during the 24 hours, the force of the wina was registered as high as, or higher than, 7, the number on Captain Beaufort's table denoting "'a moderate gale ;" on some of these days the gale did not last more than two or three hours. The same re. mark apphes to the days in the " strong breeze" column, which are those wherein the highest number registered as the force of the wind was 6. All other days are called moderate, and some of them were calm. The " night gale' column shows the number of gales that did not, as usual, moderate at dark and spring up again at daylight or sunrise, but continued through the night; these were generally the heaviest gales; many of the nighlts included in the "moderate" column were perfectly calm. The "rainy" column shows the number of days on which it rained the greater part of the day, as it never rained for a whole day during the five months. The " showery" column shows the days on which there were frequent showers of rain or hail, some of which were very heavy. On some of thosedays markel " fine" there were occasionally slight showers, but they were not sufficient to prevent us caling them fine days.
The barometer and thermometer were registered evory four hours.
The Falkland Ilands, nearly 90 in number, lie between the latitude of 51 deg. and 52 deg. 45 min. south, longitude 57 deg. 20 min. and 61 deg. 40 miin. west. The two largest, of considerable extent, aro called East and West Falkland. The eastern island is the larger, being about 130 miles long, 80 miles at its greatest breadth, and narrowing to about 35 miles at the southern point. The western island is about 100 miles in length and 50 in width. Between these two islands the channel is from seven to 12 miles across, and many of the smaller islands are situate in this channeL It is navigable for ships of any size. The various harbours are particularly good, being mostly formed by bays well sheltered. The geographical position of the islands and their proximity to Cape Horn render them the fittest place for vessels to touch at bound to and from the Pacific Ocean. The climate is constantly temperate, as is stated in Tarious works of authority, and which is evidenced by the quantities of wild horned cattle, hogs, horses, rabbits, which are to be found on the East FaLkland during the summer and wiater in good fat condition.
In summer the thermometer seldom rises above 70 deg., although it has boen at S0 deg.
In winter it rarely falls below 30 deg., although it hasbeen so low as 20 deg., but in only two or three temporary in. stances; the weeklv average at midnight during the three winter months-viz., June, July, and August of 1838 and 1839 being mostly above the freezing point of 32 deg., and the lowest 24 deg., from the 10th to the 16th of August, 1838.
The frost is never so strong as to freeze the water sufficiently to bear any weight. The snow rarely lies more than two days on the ground, and then only a few inches in depth.
The climate throughout the year is far more equable and the nights much lighter and milder than in England. In London the thermometer, in 1838, fell in October to 26 deg.; in November to 22 deg.; in December to 16 deg. ; and in January, 1839, to 10 deg.; while at Berkeley Sound, in 1838, the lowest point at midnight of the four corresponding months was in April 29 deg.; May 25 deg.; June 24 deg.; July 25 deg.

Half-Notes Doing Double Duty.-A short
HALF-NOTES DOING DOUBLE DUTY.-A short time ago we stated that severalhalves of bank-notes had been transmitted to a draper in Manchester, in anticipation of full payment for the order by which the half-notes were accompanied, and that, as tho corresponding halves never came to hand, it was suspected they were also being made to answer the onurpose of whole notes. This has proved to be the case, ana our reporteryesterday saw the unlucky holders of half-notes which should have been worth 301. to each person, but which they were obliged, by an exehango of halves, to reduce to the value of 15t. each. On the 5th of January a letter, signed "Peter M'Cann," was received by Messrs. ML Kennedy and Son, drapers, 6, Church-street, in this city, ordering a quantity of silk goods and shawls. The order was accompauied by the halves of two 51. and the halves of two IO-notes, making, when comnplete, 301. The goods were to be forwarded to the Travellers' Rest, Masborough, when the other half "fnoats" would be sent. On the 7th of January, immediately after the goods first ordered had arrived at Masborough, a letter was received from Sheffield, containing an order for similar goods, addressed to MIr. James Eccles, draper, Gore-street, Manchester, to be sent to the Rose and Crown Inn, Belper, for Hugh Fagan. This order, to the extent of 301., was accompanied by the half-notes which corresponded to thoso sent to the other house, and on tho faith that the other haltf "nsts" would arrive tho goods were despatched; and neither they nor the ingenious cuistomer have since been heard of. Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Ecoes met yesterday at the detective office, and mutually divided the money. Mr. Eccles, on referring to his file, found a letter, in a similar handwriting, dated December last, enclosing tlse half of r. 51-note, the corresponding half of which arrived in due course. The letter was signed "Charles 'Veigh," which there is isemo reason to believe is the real name of the writer. The speUing of several words is also the same, for instance, "noats," and "tow," for two. The delinquent is ascertained to be a travelling hawker.- Manchester Examinier.
How xo R.,ISE RECRuIrs IN SCOILAND.-When the war began there was great difficulty in raising recruits in the north of Scotland. A suggestion was made in 27e nmes that a dep6t of the 79th should be stationed at Aberdeen asa popnlar Hfighland regiment. This was acted on, and before the war had closed 000 ablebodied recruits were raised I The depot has nowr been removed, and scarcely a single rccruit is obtained.
TIlE BcaIR}D Docuse.-LIERvPOOL, Jan. 28. -At a meeting of the Liverpool town-council to-day the bills which had been prepared by a special committee in regard to the completion of the existing do^ks at Birkenhead and the construction of large new works on that estate were brought up for approval. The leading features of the plans are the formation of a low water basin, containing 12 acres, a direct communication thence into the great float, an extension and alteration of the present Morpeth dock, the walling in of one of the existing basins, and the constrction of an immense landing-stage in tho place of the present pier at the Woodside ferry. It is anticipated that these facilities will not only largely increase the commnercial capacity of tho port, but will afford an amount of railway accommodation which has long been desired by the promoters of the railway interests whose terminx are at Birkenhead. The bill for carrying out these objects was sanctioned, together with a second bill, which proposes to assimilate in every respect tho management of the Birkenhead Docks to that of the Liverpool Docks, the Birkenhead wrorks being under the direction of the Lverpool ;)ock trustees, though owned by the Liverpool oorporaSion. These i, however, an act, of Parliament which provides at a future day for the complete transfer, under proper eqnitable arrangement, of the whole Birkenheoad estateg to tae Liverpogi Vock truzina
