Turkey has hithertobeen, and sh is, deprived of manyuseful and even necessary provisions for the comfort and ornament of its numerous cities, not excepting the capital itself. Foremost among its most urgent reqgirements must be Dlaced the adoption of gas, now wholly unknown there; and it has been ascertained that the introduction of this admirable and economical mode of public and private lighting will bo hailed as a boon by allelassesof the population, from the lowest up to Bs high-minded and enlightened SOTereign, umder whose immediate patronage it is proposed toplace the present undertaking. The Ottoman Empire orda a'wdescope for the onerations of tnis Company, as the followingfacts will demonstrate. CoDitantinople has a mixed population of Muumans, Europeans. Greeks, Armenians, &c., approaching a millon of soul it contains a large number of palaces and public edifices. The Sultan alone hasseveral immense palaces; the Sublime Porte, where the Government affairs cre carried on, forms of itself a small city; there are also extensive barracks, colleges, manufactories, cafEs, theatre club-houses, and other places of public entertamment, several hundred morgues and bath-hou a large number of which for the comfort and convenience of theinabitants, are kept open auring thoe whole night, as the time most suitable for the enjoyment of thatoriental luxuy. Steps have been taken to procure from the Sultan of Turkey aflrman or concession, securing to this Company, for a tem of years, the exelusive privilege of suplying with gas all places within the sovereignty and dominions of the Turkish Empire. t Two of the Directors, one havingr an intimate knowledge of the country, the other being~ practically acquainted wiith all the details in relation tO the manufacture of and lighting by gas, have already left this country for Constantinople, w ith full powers to conclude the necessary arranlements. Coals are to be had in Turkey, and it is believed that English enterprise will work the native collieries more vigorously than hitherto but slping employed extensively between the countries, especially in the grinele, wili always carry coal in lieu of ballast from England, ata. mnoderate rate. The coke, tar, and other products, arising from the manufacture of gas, are smur to meet with a ready market. Calculations have been made as to the expense of the present mode of lighting with olive oil, and the Directors are enabled to state that gas can be siip0,led at a rate whieh will cormpare so favourably, as to render certain ita general adoption. Power will be reserved to take advantage of the provisions of any law that has been or may be passedfor Hmiting the liabiltyof shaeholders in joint-stock com aniea.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGEZyCb.. HOUSE OF LORDS, THURSDAY, MoAH 6. The Lonn COH CELLOl took his seat on the woolsack at | 5 o'clock. TheEarlof SEEAFTESBURypresentedpetitions from Ilessiugham and Bottesford in favour of church-rates, from ILingybi and Llanaehaim, against the endowment of Maynooth; from the parish of Holy Trinity, Nottinghara, WYesIsyans of Northampton, Taunton, the Dissenters of Mtaize- hilChapel, Greenwvich, Tunbridge Chapel, New-road', WVeymouth, and from the ParticuLar Baptists of March, against opemung the I3ritish Museum, &c., on the Lord's-day. CEHURCH-RATES. The Bishop of EXETER, in presenting petitions from placesin IDevon and Cornwall against the removal of the liabilities now existing for the payment of church-rates without an equivalent, said, he should have been content to place them upon thetable withoutremark had it notbeenfor whathad passedwithin the last24 hours in another place. Of course he would not be guilty of the irregularity of alluding to anytling that had happened in the House of Commons, but their lordships had been made acquainted by the pub prints with what had taken place elsewhere, and he thought it was his duty to take somne notice of a startling declaration made by persons of high position in the State. He hadthat morning read the opinions entertained by Her MaJesty's principal Minister with regard to the question of churchrates. He found t*at Her MaJestys Government intendedto support the measurenow before the House of Commons, with certain amendments, andthemaingrounduponwhichtheirin tentionwasfounded was, thata billupon thesubjecthadbeen laid upon the tableof thishouse lastsessionbytheoAchbishop of Canterbury and read a first time. It was said, upon the authority of that bill, that the heads of the church were in favour of putting an end to church-rates in all parishes which had signified their refusal to pay them for a certain number -of years. He protested against the supposition that this was the opinion even of the bishops; it was far from being that of the members of the church of England at large. He had not yet met with a single clergyman or Churchman who had expressed anything like approbation of the enactment to which he had referred; everyone had spken of It wlth LabLWaLhment, considering the quarter Mrm which it proceeded. It appeared that even in that quarter there was no very sanguine hope entertU-a4i.f. the bill would be allovwed to pass, because its second reading was never proposed, and never, as he beheved, even thought of. He happened to be in the country at the time it was brought forward, and he had received no intination with respect to it. He protested, therefore, against its having ascribed to it the imprtance df having received the sanction of the bishops. Solittle confidence in its merits was felt by its authors that not only had they not proposed it for the consideration of Convocation, but those members of the committee of the Lower House to whom had been intrusted the duty of preparing a measore on the subject were notoriously adverse to it. Its authors shrank from re-introducinr it in this house, and also from proposing it to Convocation, and yet it was said actually to have had the effect of changing the opinions and the conduct of two leading members of the Government -the Prime Minister and the Secretary for the Home Department. The opinion entertained by the Archbishop of Canterbury was entitled to the greatest respect, but he protested against its being spoken of in the terms which had een employed by the noble lordat tbe head of the Government. He would abstain from entering into the general question, but he thought it was his duty to niake some remarks upon the point to which he had called their lordships' at'tention. Lord PORTMAAN also presented petitions against the abolition of church-rates without an equivalent. SALARIES OF COUNTY COIURT JUDGES. Lord PORTMAN gave notice of his intentionto movo resolutions on the subject of the payment of County Court judges after Easter. The LORD CHANCELLOR begged to inform the noble lord that it was his intention to introduce a measure upon this subject on MIonday, and then he should propose to postpone the second reading until after Easter. Lord BROUGHA31 expressed his great satisfaction that his noble and learned friend at last had turned his attention to a subject which he (Lord Brougham) had endeavoured so often to urge upon him. CONSOLIDATED FUND (1,631,0051. Is. od.) BILL. This bill, upon the motion of Lord STANIEy of ALDER. L'y, was read a third time and passed. EXCFEQUEP BILLS FUNDING BILL, AND ANNUITILES BILL. Upon the motion for the second reading of these bils, Earl GREYrose and said,-My lords,before these bills are read a second time I think it is necessary that the Housd should agree to consider the policy and the grounds upon which we are called upon to make this addition to the national debt. I do not mean to impede the passing of the bill, but Icannot consent to allow a measure of this description to pass without expressing my strong opinion of the impolicy of that course to ma!;e further addition to the national debt. I wouldremind your lordships that, within the financial year now about to close 23,000,0001. have already been added to the debt, a loan of 16,000,0001. was raised, and there has also been an issue of nbout 7,000,0001. of Exchequer-biUs. We are now called upon to' agree to a bil which sanctions a further loan of 5,000,0001., thus making a total addition to tne national debt within the fncial year of 28,000,0001. I would beg to remind your lordaships that these sums only provide for expenditure already incorred. We have been told upon the highest authority that these sums will only provide for the expenses of the war up to the termination of the present financial year-that is up to the Ist of April next-so that,even if ths war be ended toInu-r-, - 4o; -6 -ill befurtherlarge sums to be provided for in this year, and as to the means of raising which we have as yet no information. I cannot but regard this bill as a great departure from what was announced to be the policy of the Government at the commencement of the war. At that period we were told, not, indeed, that the whole supplies for the war should be raised within the year for wlnch they would be required-that, as I understood, was never intended-but the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I believe, said, and said wisely and properly, that it was the deliberate opinion of the Government of that day-of which a majority of the members of the present Government were also members-it vas the deliberate opinion of the Government that a great effort should be made to raise at least a large proportion of the expenses of the war by means of taxation rather than by loanis. (Hear.) I have pointed out tb your lordships thlat within one financial year we have raised and are raising 28,000,0001. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is reported to have stated lately that the whole expenses hitherto incurred on account of the war amount to 46,000,0001. Thus, besides the 28,000,0001. raised within thepresent year, there was also a su5 raised in 1854, the exact amount of which I am unable to arrive at, butI believe a sum of 3,000,0001. or -4,000,0001. was raised in the course of that year. Therefore the total amount of debt already incurred on account of the war is certainly not less than 30,000,0001. I believe it somewhat exceeds that amount. In round num-bers, out of 46,000,0001. of expenses you have provided for three-fourths by means of loans. The Earl of DERBY.-Two-thirds. Earl GREY.-At all events, somewhere between twothirds and three-fourths of the whole expenses have been met, not by taxation, but by loans. I confess that apnears to me to be a most injudicious policy. I think the orfgial intention of the Government at the commencement of the v,ar was far wiser, because it is admitted by all that the sacrifices which a nation is called upon to bear by means of taxation are less than those exacted by loans. At the end of a certain number of years, if a calculation bemade of the total amount raised in the country by the two modes of providing for the expenditure, it is notorious that much less is really required when vigorous efforts are made at first to raise whatever may be needed by means of taxation. I am certain that whatever facility may be obtained at first by raising loans is in the end morethanbalanced by aggravated presspre on the people. It is quite as true of nations as of individuals, that borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry, and we know that the practice of raising large sums by loans invariably leads to extravagance in the public expenditure, and to the neglect of all wise precautions in seeing thatthemoney so raised isproperlyapphed. Ithink there never was a case inwhich thlat truth was more clearly proved than the present. It is impossible to look at the estimates which have been laid before the other House of Parliament during this and the last session without seeing that all idea of economy has been absolutely scouted. (Hear. hear.) I Ikow it is said that in war we should DeaoeaL consaermiv= --f--x differ from that opinion. I quite agree that you ought not to allow yourself to be deterred by questions of expense f-om adopting the most vigorous and effective means to bring the war to a succeessful termination. I admit that it would berbad economy not to bring hostili. tiesl to as speedy a termation aspossible, but it is peculiarlynecessaryin thepresent war that a sagreeconomyshould be practised. Tfhe greater thewar indeed the more necessary it is that economy should be practised. A cursory esamina- non of the votes of the presentyear will, I think,-show that this principle has not beenacted upon. If it had, this subsidiary loan would have been uncalled for. I wish to call the attention of your lordships to the enormous expenditure for the militia. Parliament is called upon this year to proVide in one way or another for the militia a sum that excweds rather than falls short of 4,000,000W. Last year a similarexpense wasincurred. Now, whenthe nature of the present war is considered, it cannot bepretended that there, is any danger of attack at home, and it appears to me that this is a most enormous sum which has been wasted or worse than wasted. The noble lord at the head of the Government is reported to have said that the number of traiinin recruits who have joined the army from the militia is 24,000. Is not the expense incurred most enormous incomparison with the result? With this sum the Governnent might have obtained a-larger number of recruits, and might have kept up. the army to its complete strength, instead of allowing it to be at one time 40,000, and afterwards 20,000 helow the niunbers voted by Parliament. Last year I protested against the outlay for works and fortifications, and this year I feel bound to repeat this protest. The Governmnent this gear asked Parliament to vote for fortifistions and works at-home and abroad 1,700,0001. being an increase of 600,0001. upon the large vote of a,l00,0J0i. taken fot this purpose last year. The majority of these new fortifications and works are admitted to have no reference to the present war. During the present war, at least, fortifications upon the coast are uot iequired, and most of those in comtemjdlation are not expected to be completed until after the war is over. On these grounds, therefore, I think there is strong reason for objecting to this vote. The pressure upon the-resources of a nation by. a war expenditure is not to be q_neasured lDy the.amount of taxes. The increased taxes indeed, and fhe'1arge sums borrowed form the enal*t part of the pressure brought to bear upon the re- soUTrcesofacountry.Everyadditionof exenditurewithdrawn something fromthe general means of the population. Take the case of the screw colliers withdrawn by the Government from the trade in which they are engaged in bringing the supply of coals to the metropolis The publc are deprived of the advantage and economy of the employ of these vessels, and the consumer and the trader have to pay a higher price in consequence of the demand for these vessels. Every additional artisan, every additional labourer employed in the Government dockyards, and everv additional pound laid out upon the war is so much withdrawn from the great work of production which is going on to meet the-multitudinous wants of a great nation. -It ia - perfectly true that, in consequence of the wide change in onr coTmnercial policy ten years ago and the great improvement in the condition of the country, the burden of the present war has been borne with greater ease than might have been anticipated, but it is idle to say that this burden is not felt. Your lordships may see the severity of this burden in the war prices of every artiele, in the rate of wages, and the interest of money, and vou ma trace its effect in restricting manyvaluable enterrises and useful undertakings. It is the duty of the Government to abstain from increasing this necessary pressure, from aggravating this distturbance of industry by any demands upon the public that can possibly- be postponed. Last vear I maintained that fortifications and works which were not necessary for purposes of defence ought to be postponed. The Secretary of State for the War Department met this argument last year by reasoning 'which, I confess, surprised me. He said, "It is very true these things may not be wanted nOW; but Parliament is in the humour to give us the money, and, if we wait, we do not know that the humour will continne." It is a most extraordinary argument to come from a :Minister of the Crown, that because the nation is unduly excited, because the war fever is upon the people, the Government will take advantage of the circurnstance, and hurry them into injudicious expenditure which they will afterwvards regret. The Government ought to know that the greater the extravagance now the greater vwll be the reaction of the public mind by and bye, and the greater the indisposition to afford to future Governments the means of keeping up aggregate naval and military establishments. (Hear, hear.) I sav further, that these works ought not to be pressed forward at this moment, because there is a moral certainty that they cannot be e-xecuted to advantage during war. War increases the price of labour and material, and thu wtme wor;s will cost more now thau if executed hereafter, duringpeace. *RuL noreover,itisqalte certain the mode of aplyIMng these large sunasca v0 ni'oerlv considered. The war itself necessarnly absorbs the wn oie nen~.. er,;.-. thonu,l i:a of Henr hlJst' Government and of the military departments, and, when their thoughts are taken up and their best energies are tasked to the utmost with the duties of making arrangements for the efficient prosecution of hostilities they cannot possibly enter, vwith 'dnae deliberation, into the very difficult questions of how fortifications, barracks, and other military works are to be constructed upon a wise and permanent plan. We ought to take warning from the past. Millions upon millions have been lavished upon fortifications sincc the peace of 1815, and of all those millions, I wll venture to say, three-fourths have been actuallywasted. A considerable proportion has been worse than wasted. I wiU prove to the satisfaction of any man of ordinary judgment that it would be worth while to spend a great deal of money to puU down many of the fortifications which have been erected during that period. We have experience of the manner in which the public money has been wasted and with that experience wmll you commence fortifications and military works which are to cost many millions to finish, which if left unfiiished will be useless, and which are planned upon the same principles, and by men of the same school as those former works that have caused so much public disappointments Such a course would be in the highest degree imprudent ad injudicious, if we had no special grounds to warnus against it. But it must he wel knowa to most of your lord;hips that men of the highest ability have latelycomeforward and asserted that the old principles of fortification are altogether erroneous, that a totally different system ought to be followed, that the money aLready spent has been absolutely wasted, that the new principlesfor which they contend have been adopted by Russia, so far as vas practicable, during the emergency of war, and that to their adoption must be mainly attributed the skiU and efficiency displayed ian Russian works and the unquestionable superiority of Bussian engineers over English enIeers during the memorable siege of SebastopoL Your lordUsps will perceive that I am alluding to the writings of Mr. Fergusson. I am not qualified to pronounce whether Mr. Ferguason's opino are right or wrong; but this I will say, that Mr. Fergusson's views are supported with extraordinary ability, with powers of reasoning I have rarely seen equalled, and have commanded the assent of some of the highest military authorities. [A naoble Ios-" The late Sir Charles Napier."] As my noble friend reminds me, that very great officer, the late Sir Charles Napier, expressed his complete adoption of the views of Mr. Eergusson. (Hear.) Those view;s have commanded general assent, and, I say, further, that as yet they have received no sufficient answer. Reading the answers which have hitherto been made, it is impossible not to be struck with the great similarity between them and the answers which mn all ages of the world have been given by the disciples of old and antiquated systems to innovators who have made the greatest discoveries in every branch of science. Copernicus, Gahleo, Newton, all the gxeat philosophers, when they broached their valuable discovenes, were met in the same spirit as that in which Mr. Fergusson has been met by the old school of engineers. They were all upstarts whentheir discoveries were firs promulgated. (Hear.) The samne gentlemen-Mwr. Fergusson and others-have crificized the very l'test works constructed by the present school of engieers in a manner which appears tome very diiiicult to answer. I think those who have read the remarks on the new fortifications in the Isle of Wight and elsewhere will agree with me that those remarks do require some very complete answer. Among unprofessional men, who are guided by principles of common sense, the opinion prevails that very great mistakes have been made in our fortifications, and, knowing that blunders have been before discovered, I do say it would be -npardonable if the Government expended another shiling until the whole subject has undergone careful and impartialconsideration. I say impartial cosia=tion, bocause 3I :e aaIiazulrcb1with an exanmination by merely mrlitary engineers. I would earnestly urge the Secretary of State for the War Department to appoint a commission consisting, not only of the highest military engineers, but including civil engineers and naval officers (especially naval officers who have had experience during the present war), carefully to investigate all those questions before he allows another shilling to be spent on the costly works which are now in progress. I have stated the reasons why I think a great want of economy has been shown in the manner in which large sums have been applied and my reasons for objecting to this continual increase of the national debt. I will only add that I do most earnestly hope and trust, the whole expenditure - during the present year will be carefully considered, not!-only by the Govexnment hrt by Parliament; because I cannot help saying Kta the blame of the extra7agances which have been committed rests less with the Government than with Parliament, and especially with the other House, 'which, instead of performing its proper and constitutional functions of closely scrutinizing the expenditure of the Government and taking care that no unnecessary sum should be levied on the people, has hounded on the Gover n- ment, if I may so express it-has stimulated the Government to the utmost-to expend the largest possible amount of moneyfor warlike purposes. Ido hope and trust that in the present session the HouLe of Commons will be more disposed than in the last session to look closely and narrowly into these affairs. I do believe that even with a viewto the permauent strength and safety of the country, this subject cannot~ be considered unimportant, because, after a the true defence of the' naton consists, not in fortifications, in barracks, or even in ships. It consists, next to the spirit and courage of the people, in the magnitude of our resources. Modern warfare is becoming more and more a contest of the purse as well - as of the person, and it is by economizing our resources, by not pressmg on the means of accumulation, by enabling industry and enterprise to proceed unchecked, that the real power and the real safety of the country can best be increased; and that is more particularly the case at this moment when, with the facilities of communication with different parts of the world, any undue pressure on the means of the people in one country is immediately and inevitably attended with an efflux of the people to other countries where they can pursue their various professions. For these reasons I condemn the policy of Her :Ninjesty's Government. Though it be too late to reca the past-though I know we must provide for expenditure already incurred and raise money urgently wanted-and though I am aware this loan canniot berefaused-there is ample timetoconsider the future, and the only opportunity which independent members of this and the other House have of impressing their views upon the Legislature is when we are caled npon to sanction a proposition of the Government such as th;s, which I, for one, cannot approve. (Hear, hear.) Lord PAN tIURE,-My lords, the speech of my noble friend compels me to trouble your lordships with a few *-t-. -M1s,Ml, T -2 -f o Ilis riwome nlave been- necessary for nme to malke on the present occasion. 'WIth reference to those parts of the speech of my noble friend which alluded to the financial question involved in the imoteio before yup r itrdsips, shal 'leave of thersto eal with them, and shall more inMmediately advert to the charge madebymy noble friend aggainst theGovernment for anundue expenditure, and an uneconomical management of the finances of the country in the course of the present war. My noble friend has confined himself to two particular subjects upon which he has thought it right to remark. He first alluded to the large votes which had been taken on account of the militia; and he, in the second place, remarked upon the votes which had been taken for. the purpose of erecting wvorks and fortifications at home and abroad. My noblp friend began by asking what good the country had derived from the great expenditure for the miitia. My simple answerto thatis, thatthemilitiahas, of its own voluntary efforts, given to this country, I may say, very -nearly 27,000 troops. I may remind my noble friend that, in addition to that fact, the militia has garnsoned with 12 of its regiments military posts in the MedieirTanean, which has enabled regiments of the line to go on service at the seat of war. I may further remind my noble friend that, in addition to thes circumstances, the ranining of the militia has imbued a military spirit throughout the country, which has induoed our youth to volunteer in great nuniers for foreign 'service. Since the 1st of January I believe upwards of 13,000 men have joined the staneardof the British army. Butthat is not all which the militia has done.. I think the militia has proved to ns what the country gentlemen can do when caUed upon to defend their hearths and their altars. (Cheers.) Nothing has afforded, me greater gratifieation than one circumstance-and I am glad to have this opportunity of xaentioning it-that with reference to the garrison of Gibraltar -the major part. of which consists of militia, although there'are also two regiments of the line there-Sir James Fergasson has, in a publicorder, statedthathe was indebted to'a colond of the militia for being the best brigxdier in Gibraltar for many years, and 'that he had afforded him the best support in training the gaxrison of that impor- tant fortress. I feel bound to menticn the naYme of that. officer-ColonelWilg7eaPattem. (ear,ehear.) This WoU1A ! ot mike it uppear that the expenditure on the militia bad been thrown away; nor do I thinkthaft the sun which has beensoeendedisoogreat. A reat deal of that expene has been incrred by zeemovin" the militia as fast as we could out of bilfets into arrack. Befor:-,tho erection of barracks they were put into huts, in oAi-r- to relieve the comnIumty from atax which has been foundto bear -very uneqully. Though I am ready to admit that improvements maybe made in the course of time with reference to the trainig, the exercising, and the appointments of the milhti, tet Icannot admit that the smns which have been expended on this national force have been in anymianner thrown away. - now come to the other part of the speech of m;y noblefriend, in which he referred to works &nd fortifications. -Ido not recollect havingused the argument*hich my-noble friend has attributed to me; but if I did rse it, Inam not disposed to abandon it at the present momentnamely, that I thought at this period, when the public were avwake to all the mconveniences which have been o2oa-sioned by a formersystem of economy, it would be proner to ask them to do that at a time when their spirit irasalive -which, after a few years of peace, they might be indisposed to do at alL My noble friend says that the best preparatioa for war is to economiz,e our resources in peace, so #ith when war comes we may be ina >fit andproper state to-en. gage in it. Why, my lords, we had been economizing our recources for the last -40 years, and yet, when war came, I did notfind that the nation was ina fit state to meet it. It is trne we hadafine army,but that army was t9o smalL From the economy of the last 40 years that army, which w2s so beautiful to look at, was utterly unfit to go into the field. I do trust this will never' occar again. I trast that the eyes of the nation are sufficiently open to Inow it is of practical importance that au army should be-able to move anywhere in efficient order -to meet the consequences that may come upon us, as the present war has done, unexpectediy and with somewhat oi saddenness. I apprehend that a period of war is not at all an inapprooriate period to look at the state of our defences, without which are threatened al our otherwise great resources. 1- shouid not think any period, whether of peace or war, was g an inappropriate time to fortify and protect the great dockyard of Portsmouth, and to secure it against a sudden irruption, come from what qnarter it mayr. Nor canI admit that a time of war is an inappropriate period to defend the great part of the estimates are for for-tifications, for the means of defending t he coast, the dockyards, and our commerCial harbours at honme, so as to be able to meet any sulldden erulption upon our coasts. If these were not de - fended, I would asic what would become of all those great resources which we have been accunmulating duirt -a lengthened poia c-f neacel I think the speech of my- nobie friend is the precursor of many ol .hs if it' please God we should return to astate of p>eace. Bet would warnthis Houseand the countrynat to fisten to thesesudden suggestions of a return to a system of stringent. economy, which may prove in the end far mere expensivethan if we were to submit annually to a certain burden of taxation which would almost keep us in a state of defence by which we may be ready to meet any enemy, whether he - come from a-far or from a neighbouring country. I do not hold, because this country places itself in such a state of defence as is necessary for the maintenance of its position as a great nation, that any Power in Europe has a nght to find': fault with it. Wedoitwithno intention of invading the. territory, or of attacldng either the property or the constitu.- tion of any neighbouring State. We do it simply because our resources are large, and because we think it fit to protectthem. I cannot conceive how blame canl be attached to a nation for protecting its resources any more than to an individual who taes every means in his power to protect his own property, which may be as valuable to him as the resources of the country areto the public. (Hear, hear.) lord IONTEAGLE said he must now, as hehad on. former occasions, protest against the doctrine that it was the duty of the Government to meet the expenses of a gret. - European war bythe annual taxation of the country. Hehbad endeavouned to showthat the questionwnaswlether itwould be consistent with their duty to draw the whole expenseof the war from the revenue of the immediate time, and without reference to the future resources of a great commercial country, even if they were rich enough to do so. (Hear.) Into these questions, however, he would not now enter at any length, because the time for a most iinportant but necessry financial operation was approaching, and it would be difficult to discuss this subject without imprudence aud thechance of depriving the Chancellor of the Exchequer of those advantages to wizch 'he was justly entitled. He hoped, however, that their lordships would not be impeded hereafter in their. discussion of these matters throng having passed them over now. In all the rest of the observations of his noble friend (Earl Grey) he entirely agreed. Depend uvpon it, that to keep up anything approaching to a war establishmentt is toneof peace was an experiment wlich would and mnst faiL The effect o'it would, perhaps, be to create an indisposition on the patof the people of T igland and of their representatives to do what was rtally necessary; and, in the endeavour to claim too much from. the taxation of the people, the Government' would very probably be left with too little. (Hear, hear.) That was the danger he apprhended. His noble friend, how. ever, had always studiously guarded hirmself againist the supposition that he wished to stint the war; but when the Government came to deal with large sums of borrowed money, it was not cnly extravagnce in, carryig out the immediate objects of tlte wr which wvas to be apprehended, but anextravaga3nce pervadinz all our establishments. For e.xample, it was impossible to¶hear of the purchases of great br;ildmgs, of large nlot5 of land, of the nndertaking of great enterprises-certainly not of an urgent kind, withont being persuaded of the extravagant expenditure wRhich a certain amount of borrowed money eucouraged in Gvrenmoents as wellas in individuals. (Hear, hear.)I At the same time, howvever, their lordshivs would do wrong if they allowed themselves to be cased away by his noble friend's argument that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had abandoned the principle of providing bytaxation for a great portion of thle national expenditure, and was relying wholly npon the borrowing principle. His; right hon. friend hiad done no such thing. Parliament had imnposed the Succession Duty; it had increased the income-tax, the malt-tax, the tea, sugar, and spirit duties, and, in feet, most of .*h.*Do .o.45o .oe~tzicles of consumption. It would be unjust, therefore, to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say-that he was relying tee much on borrow ed monsey. His noble friend had spoksen of the great resources w hich a prosperous country like ours possessed. That was true; but its greatest resource was in its public credit, founmded on its public faith (hear, hear);and he (Lord Monteagle) .had always endeavonred to show that in excluding public credit as one of the national resources PVarliament was really flinging away one of the greatest elements of our national strength. (Hear.) His noble friend had spokren truly a s to the pressure of the wa upon persons of fixed incomes and upon the working classes. But what would have been the condition of these persons if the millions of money required to carry on the war had all been raised by inereasedtaxation ? Had the malt-tax and the sugar duties been doubled, the income-tax raised beyond the amnount it had ever stood at before, had Parliamnent restored the old rates of duty upon tea, and proceeded upon the same principle with r-egard to other large articles of consumption, what w;ould have been the result to those poersons for whom his noble friend had claimed tlheir lordships' care and consideration? WVhy, they would have been utterly crushed. (Hear, hear.) Something had been said bvhBis noble friend as to the danger of driving our opo,clation out of the country. to other places where they could turn their industry to better account. Novr he (Lord :NIonteagle) had all his life been a friend toemigration, hut, depend upon it, there was nothing by which emigration could be more enforced than by the attempt, at such natime as this, to carry on the war altogether by pressing on the springos of industry and by increasing the cost of living to the wrorkiing classes, instead of borrowing with prudence, good sense, and, he might be allowved to hope, with that success in the future which had attended past loans. [Hear, hear.) With regard to the miii,he knew from long experence that there was no man in England who had paid such attention to this subject in all its bearings as his' noble friend, and he hoped at some future time the question of the militia would be fully discussed by their lordships. As to the e.xpenditure in public works, he must say, the reasoning of the Secretary for War appea red singularly inconclusive on this point, because, if there was one principle which ought to be more recognized than another, it was that, when Parliament was callodupon to defray the charges of a great war, that was precisely the moment when fhe Government ought not to open up fresh sources of expenditure for any undertakiing thowever plausible acase was made out in its favour) whickhmaghtbe postpenod toa futnre time. (Hear.) There-was one other subject to whiehhewishedto call theirlordslhips' attention. He did not, and he believedthat no one did, object to any amount of expenditure necessary for the vigorous prosecution of the war, but he did object to any increase of expenditure which was not forthat -omnrpo, and he did object mo$st grnn I-' V1 [flon^rvbE r pUxr sV ; urealang'The efficiency of the forces being applied for any other purposes. His noble friend opposite (amord Derby) would recollect an occasion npon which Sums of money voted for the army were applied in the construction of publ c -works, because be him - self had come forward to correct that evil. and he wouldc also recollect;that at- one. tune the salaries of the North American. bishops and of the Canadian clergy were p aid out of the army estUmates. N ow the law as itat present stood-and he spoke adv isedlylaid down the - rinciple, that no lsnister o f the Crown had thepower, wi wut-. exposing himself to the liabihty of impeac hment for a hi h crime and misdemeanour, of apply ing s ums voted forthe armny to naval purposes or to matters connected with the Ordnance, - or, vice verng, of applying sumas voted for the navy or tbe Ordnae to arnypurposes . The sums of money - voted forthose three branches of the services were allowed to be eq endedfor tl os epsalone forwhich h tey had been voted byParliament. he estimatesforthose services consistei of a number of votes, and it might happen that there would bean excess uon vote 1, and a deficiency upon vote 2; but, by a clause introduced by Sir J.-Grah(an it was iendere d allowable to apply the excess of one vote to supply the deficiency of another in the same department if a case of absolute ne-- cessity were aade out and the consent of the Crown signified through the Treasury. He much feared, however,. that there was some intention of varying that wise principle,. judging from the mode in which the estimates for the' urrent year were prepared. BBy the consolidation of the War Department some 34,000,0007. would be placed under the control of the Mnist6r for W,ar, and the army and Ordnance were united; but it was never intended, nor would it be consistent with constitutional law, that sums voted for the one service sho7uld be' plied to the turposes of the other; and he trusted-that the Hlose of Commons wo oul neverllowsuehaprindcple to be carried into exection' withoutthe fullestnquirUand consideration. Tromthenman- ner in which the estiimats for the presentyear were framed it was possible that mnoney voted for the aryin. the Crimea might be e mployed for Or dnace works, an d that w s a state of thinsugs which he couldt nt approve, and whichlha trutded wuod never obt.is. the sacti,on of Parliament,.

NoN:ATIoN Fon BosRON.-The nomination of candidates for Boston took place yesterday in front of the Assembly-rooms. The- mayor, Mr. F. Cooke, presided. M£r. White proposed MIr. W. Adams, and Mr. Wren seconded the nomination. hlr. W. Tuxford proposed and Mr. Thomas seconded the nomination of Mlr. Herbert IDgram. hIr. Adams, in his address to the electors, sail that the war had been drawn upon us by the incapacity of the Government of the day, but he hoped that no Englishman would sanction anyffiing in t e shape of peace until the object for which the war had been carned on should be completed. Mfr. Adams touched upon some social and political matters, intimating, amoiig other things, that he did not see aiiy necessity for the ballot. Afr. Ingram told the electors that if they returned him he should enter the House a thoroughly. independent man. He should support the principles of the great party of progress in the House of (ommons. Mr. Ingram then spoke in favour of the ballot, and said he was the advocate of a complete reform in the army, the navy, and the civil service of the country. He was also a firm supporter of the alliance between England and France. At the show of hands only about 40 were held upfor Mr. Adamis, while the uumber for Mr. Ingram azpounted to about 3,000. The mayor having declared tha show of hands to bein favour of Mfr. Ingram, a poll was demanded on the part of Mr. Adams, which wil take place to-day. Avote of thanke to the msyor was agreed to.

LONfDOA, FRIDAY, MARCH 7, 1856. In the House of Lords yesterday, Lord FORTMAN gave notice he should, after Easter, move resolutions on the question of the payment of the Judges of the County Courts. The LoRD CLrrA?NcEnom. stated that a bill on the subject 'was nearly completed, but he would postpone the second reading till after Easter. On the motion for the second reading of the Exchequer Bills Funding Bill, Earl GmXy drew the attention of the House to the great departure there had been, as proved by the, present bill, from the policy announced by the Government at the commencement of the war. It was the opinion of the Government of thSt day that a large portion of the expenditure of the 'war should be raised by taxation ratherthar loans; but in one financialyearthey were called -on to add little less than 30,000,0001. to the national debt, on account of war expenses. He thought this a most injudicious policy. The facility of raising money in this manner led to extravagance of expenditure, and an examination of the estimates, as laid before Parliament, would prove that all consideration of economy in this war had been disregarded. Re instanced the vote of 4,000,000. for the Militia as a wholly useless expense. For mueh less money a greater number of recruits for the regular army might have been obtained. The expenditure for fortifications on the coast was worse than useless; it was not pretended that they were necessary as a defence against tlhe enemy, and he believed they were constructed on a system, that modem science proved to be defective. He alluded to the new system of fortification proposed by Mr. FxaGusoT, and acted on by the Russians with such advantage during the siege of Sebastopol. Before any more money was spent on our fortifications he urged Lord PAi,UrE to take the opinion of a commission, not composed exclusively of military men, who condemned the new system, as all innovations and improvements always have been denounced, but including also some civil engineers, -rho miight impartially decide on the efficiency of the two theories of defensive works. Lord P a-rua justified the outlay on the Militia; it had given 27,000 men to the British army, and had also done the garrison duty of the country. The fortifications, too, were no more than had long been considered necessary for the proper defence of the coast. Lord Mo.vnsGxE thought a war expenditure should not be raised altogether by loans, nor altogether by taxation, but in the manner most convenient to the people. He agreed, however, -with Earl G= that there had been a large unnecessary expense incurred during the war, for purposes not connected with it, and 'which might have been postponed. Affter the last war it was found that many SUMS of money had been expended for objects never sanctioned by Parliamnent at all; but he hoped the Appropriation Act would now prevent this abuse. Lord ST Anv of ALDmaxr stated that the 'whole extraordinary expenditure occasioned by the war,about 50,000,0001.-would be raised in nearly equal proportions by increased taxation and by loans. It was gratifying to know that the present war had been carried on. with less suffering to the country and less inconvenience to its commerce than any other war on record. The bill was then read a second time, the standing orders were suspended, and it was read a third time and passed. The House then adjourned. In the Rouse of Commons, Lord J. RUSSaLL,pursuant to notice, rose to move a series of resolutions on the subject of education. Re began by remarking upon the importance of the subject and upon the failure of all attempts to carry into effect any general measure, so that he 'was' about to embark, he said, upon a sea noted for dangerous shoals and covered with wvrecks. The present time, however, he thought propitious for a further effort to put this country upon a more equal footing in this respect with the most enlightened countries, which had succeeded in establishinga systemof national education. Inconsidbring the present state of education in this country, he acknowledged that the researches of Sir J. P-ArGTosi had been most accurate,- and that his statements were most deserving of attention. From the ceasus of 1851 it appeared that there were about 4,000,000 children and young persons between the ages of 5 andl 15, and, according to the returns of MVr. HoxAcB MA2,r~, about 2,000,000 were entered in the school books, 1,750,000 of w homwerein attendance; but, considering the character of the teachers in some of these schools, it was doubtful whether what appeared upon the surface to be education could be so considered. Of the education in the schools under the Committee of Council on Education, which were attended by upwards of 500,00D children, he would say that the grants froai 1839 hadbeen the cause of a great improvement of education, by the training schools for teachers and the general bettering of elementary education; so that, in respect to the number and character of the teachers and the education of the 500,000 children brought upon these schools, the sums laid ou1t by the votes of the Rouse had been 'well expended. But it was impossible not to admit that, wlhile such had been the advantages attendinlg this instruction, there had been great defects, and it became the Rouse to consider what was the fittest remedy. It appeared to him that Parliament should lay down two principles, from neither of 'which it slhould depart-first, to make the education of the country complete; and, secondly, to maintain, encourage, and as far as possible improve, that which was good in the existing system. lWith regard to the first, we shouLld, he thought, bring the education of the people of this counitry at Ieut to the standird in other countries-Switzer.
At the time when the great revolution in this country took place which gave to the House of Commons a decidedly liberal and popular complexion, the large changes which theu followed were based upon, principles as wide and ample as themselves. The nation, feeling much evil in. its government and institutions, was driven to look below the surface of things, to search out the cause of its dis6rders, and investigate the source and fountain of its discontents. Men then awoke to the -conviction that the time was out of joint, anci that there was hardly one of the institutions on which they were instructed to pride themselves that did not present abuses slhocking to the eye of reason and utterly disclaimed by enlightened philosophy or public spirit. Pluralities disgraced the Church, sinecures the pension-list, rotten boroughs the House of Commons. Rotten municipalities tainted the atmosphere of every country town. Commerce was fettered by illiberal restrictions, and while the hangman was busy the schoolmaster was idle. Then arose a determination in the English people that these things should be so no longer, and in the course of some five-and-twenty years they have wrought not negligently at their extinction. The wonder. is, not that these things should haive been swept away, but: how they could have been tolerated and have - flourished during the manhood'of menL not yet old. Yet more wonderful is it to reflect that the party which defended all these things . step by step, with the same cant 'phrases, the same appeals to prejudice and passion, the same narrowness of view and uniform illsuccess in action and mistakes in prediction, should still be a' 'party in the State neither wholly discredited. nor wholly deserted, but ready to choke every new improvement as it arises, to stifle - every sound principle inu its birth, and retain. yet .a little longer the remains of evil they have striven in vain to perpetuate.- It is the peejiliarity of their method of treatment that they are always provided with arguments which fit equally well every occasion,- provided the object be to resist the progress of liberality and improvement. To disfranchise a rotten borough, to dissolve a corrupt and usurping corporation, is to attack the established interest of property, the dearest right of the subject, the fundamental laws of society. The mitigation of the criminal code was opposed because it withdrew protection from property. The passing of the Prisoners' Counsel Bill was denounced for the selfsame reason. iEducation wvould teach the poor to covet the property of the rich,, and- indispose theni to that labour which was needed in order to make that property valuable. The Corn Laws were a property to the owner of la<nd, for did they not increase his rents ? The Navigation Laws were a property to the owners of ships, for did1they not, orwere theynot believed to, increase his freights by deterring competition ? Whatever mischief eannot be effected by appeals to the love of property can generally be completed by another topic, popular both with rich and poor -declamation against "the growing spirit of cen" tralization." This ground of alarm has in it more justice, and rests, it must be admitted, on a better and sounder foundation. The principle of self-government is doubtless one of the most characteristic features, of our constitution, and is to be cherished and maintained, except when it interferes with a still higher principletheKgeneral welfare of the community.. Parliament has no right to assume to itself that it is so much better and wiser than the rest of the community that it can afford utterly to disregard their prejudices, neglect theirfeelings, and go counter to their inclinations. Parliament is-and it is most desirable that it should be-not so much a despotic assembly, maldng laws ex cat7^edr for the rest of the community, as a portion and a very faithful representation of that community itself, bound to sympathize with it, and wise, even at a very considerable cost of method and of progress, to retain and preserve its sympathies. Yet even the most wholesome doctrines are liable to be perverted to the worst purposes, and after making all possible allowances for the spirit of local self-government against central dictation, how many and how great are the evils which' an abuse of this natural feeling against centralization has perpetuated, how niumero-us the benefits which it has effectally. obstructed and preventedc! " No centralization!' has ever been the cry of the Corporation of the city of London. That cry has kept it, and may keep it for a while, from a reformation ; yet who can doubt that the cry is a miserable pretence, and that in this case "no centralization"'means no reform of admitted evils, no revision of extravagance, no enforeement of responsibility ? In the name of centralization, Sir R. PEEL's plan for a metropolitan police was met and long resisted; and in the name of centralization Sir GoEORGE GOny's scheme for providing all over the counhry an adequate force for the prevention of crime is now threatened. Chartered rights," " vested interests," "local "self-government,"-under these cries has many a hardly-contested field been fought, and will, we doubt not, be fought again, whenever the opportunity offers. Corporations must continue to tax the community at large in a yearly increasing, amount that the "rights of property may be "respected," and the " vested interests" of future generations be held inviolate; and nothing mus be done to control this expenditure, to reduce its excess, and to direct the remainder into proper channels, because those who have no objection to grow rich on other people's money have too much patriotismn to bear an interference in their gains by a centralized authority. We fear it is in vain to deny that during the last few years the tide of public feeling has greatly ebbed in this country. This may be in some measure owing to the success which has attended our efforts to remove the most prominent abuses of former days, in some measnre to the defection of our popular leaders, who, after having, like Lord JoHN RussELL, formed a Government on the Appropriation Clause, view in the settlement of the Church-rate question the certain prelude to the destruction of Church and State, and inveigh with bitterness against the very principles upon which they once conciliated popular support. 13ut the best proof of the extent to which we have gone back in the last few years is afforded by the power and boldness of the party whose whole existence has been squandered in opposing whatever is good and supporting whatever is wrong. Unabashed by an unceasing success:on of failures, -unshaken by the ill-success that has waited -upon the policy' of resistance to 'wise and liberal measures, they gather round theni still a not contemptible strength, and use, not wholly without influence on the public nind, argumnents a hundred timnes refuted, predictions a hundred timnes falsified. That such men should be candidates for office, not without hope of success; that the country should be willing io intrust to such hands its. greatness. and its poower, in spite of all the' warnings of past experience and all the Teasonable conjectures that may be drawn with regard to future nmicarriages, is a degree of. folly .and . credulity which makes one almost de-, spair of constitutional Governments. A. bill cannot be carried to en'able the Court of Queenes bench io change *the place of trial from a county tD the Central Criminal Court without giving rise to apprehensions for the liberty of the subjeot, and to fears that- 'a nman may be take, behind his back and tried without the safe, guards provided by the British constitution. -Some bugbear is for ever crossing our path, and we are terrified out of an honest and public-spirited plaii far more easily than we are argued into one. The good and the evil are held in :like estimation, and, whether their lives are spent in the service 'or disservice of their country, are equally welcome to hold its offices and share its honours. Such things make a sorry remuneration .for, the past and an indifferent prospect for the future.
The papers relating to the fall of Kars are now before the public. We will take no credit, because they confirm all that has been asserted long since in these columns, for the facts were by no means secret, and might have been known by any one desirous of discovering and speaking the truth. It is enough to say that no statements of ours have given any aaequate notion of the scandal which is now revealed to the world. The silence of those who would have been, most properly, eager to defend the British Ambassador, had defence been possible, must have prepared every one for the gravity of the facts. Yet since the papers have appeared surprise at the proceedings disclosed has been the general feeling. It may be stated once more that the present Sir W. WILIArS waS after the defeats of the Tuikish army in 1854 appointed by Lord CrxNDoN Commissioner for the British Government to the Commander-in-Chief in Asia. According to general testimony, the Foreign-office made a wise selection. General WiLAmS had been engaged in the settlement of the Turco-Persian frontier; he was acquainted with the country to which lie was sent, and that he knew how to deal with its people the history of the subsequent eventful siege has proved. In what circumstances and from what causes dissension sprang up between him and Lord STRATFOrD DE REDCLIFry we care not to inquire; that General WiLmr&is was disliked by the Ambassador there is reason to know, and this dislike, expressed on more than one occasion, we may be sure was not long in reaching Turkish ears. General WiLusawLS made his way to the seat of war. He went unannounced, unaccredited, to a eamp where he was looked upon as an enemy and a spy. After the. formal honour of a reception was over, he had soon a proof of the light in wvlich he was regarded by the chiefs of the army which he came to save. Every Pasha plundered, and was ready to insult and threaten the only man who could put an end to his misdoings. What the state of the army was may be learnt from a few facts :-From 10,000 to 12,000 mehn had perished or deserted in a few months. In the middle of October the army was only 14,000 strong, but rations were drawn for 27,000. Towards the endof the month the Mushir drew rations for 33,000, without any real increase of force.. Pay was 20 months in arrear. The men were without shoes, there was scarcely any ammunition, and the arms of all kinds were nearly unfit for use. What: was the course of General -WA&3rs ? He advised, remonstrated, and threatened the intervention. of hiis Ambassador. By every post he wrote to him ; by every post he made suggestions and asked assistance. But no answer came. It is easy to see that the Turks observed the' manner in which the Commissioner's representations were treated. They had seen that he had come x among them unhonoured by the representative of his country, and that now, as months rolled away, no notice was takien of his entreaties. and suggestions. It did not require their habitual keenness in such matters to discern that the Commissioner was unacceptable to the Ambassador, and might be neglected with impunity. Perhaps there was not wanting tidings to the same effect from acquaintances at Stamboul. If only the position of a single man had been at stake, the Ambassador's conduct, however indecorous and unkind, would have been less censurable ; but the consequences in the present case were unhappily felt long after, when the ragged soldiers perished of hunger by the thousand in Ears, and three days' ammunition were for a month all that the defenders had with which to resist an attack from an ereemy happily unconscious of their weakness. At last the patience of General W=I ms was worn out. The Turks, it appears, had even refused to call on the officers of his Staff, thus evincing their contempt for him and his office. One Pasha had told him plainly that his interference would not be allowed. What must have been his feelings when from that distant region, from the mnidst of that den of iniquity and suffering, he wrote the following lines to the Ambassador ? -" With the exception of one letter," he says, "I have not been favoured with a line from your "Excellency, even with an aclnowledgment of the "reception of my public or private communica"tions. By one who has served your Lordship "for so many years this avowal can only be re"corded with feelings of deep disappointment and "mQrtHfication-feelings which I have studiously "endeavoured to conceal even from my aides-de"camp and secretaries, because each successive "post was anxiously looked for, in the hope of " receiving answers from your Lordship." Fiftyfour despatohes, each accompanied by a private letter, had up to this date, December 8,been in vain written. As in duty bound, General WnLmis transmitted a copy of this letter to the Foreignoffice. And here we must do justice to the honesty and activity of Lord CREN-DoN. He had from the beginning urged Lord STRATFORD to support General' Wrr.LA,rs and his cause to the utmost, and many were the despatches transmitted on this subject at a time when the expedition to the Crimea might seem enough to occupy a Minister at home. He now addresses the Ambassador in a tone which wve can only suppose that such a man would have borne because he felt it to be deserved. "It "would seem tnat your Excellency has not "taken any notice of Brigadier-General " WITus." "IHu MAjEsrr's Government " desire to receive your Excellency's ob" servations on the despatch of General Wu,CC rT , which I need hardly say has been read "by them with great regret, after the anxiety they "have felt and the remonstrances which they have "ti vain addressed, through your Excellency, to othe PoTE." Lord CL.&xDox then demands whether General WnrAyrs had been officially recognized by the PBoTr, and requests a copy of the document. It was, of course, not forthcoming, as it had no existence. In answer, the Ambassador is obliged to confess that he had never obtained it, conceiving that it was not wanted, though probably few out of the General's 54 despatches failed to mention the sights suffered by the writer from the wilful neglect of the Ambassador. Lord CLAR&ox edWudes, " Yoiur ExcelIency will un"derstand that H. 3TAxEsTy's Govermment re- " quire to be furnished with a full and detailed '-'report of everything that has passed between "the Embassy and the PoRTE, in compliance ." with the instructions that iso friequently, but "in vain, have been addressed to your Ex"cellency. " This is certainly a despatch which has had few parallels in British official litera-. ture; . but its tone was perhaps strenghtened by another missive from General ILLu3iAs to tht, £Foreign-office, announcing that he had now wvritten 62 despatches, and never had one.word in reply. Now for the Arabssador's defence. It is contained in,a despatch to Lord CLAzNmoz dated the * 28th of December. This document is composed.with :nnuch carb, and the writer evidently employs all the resources of his literary style. General WnrAms had been writing to him for three months, and never had an answer; but, because the General complains, Lord SmAiTonD considerslimself " en" titled to remark on. the hasty manner" in which General WIL-hi&w had "xrushed to the conclusion "that I gave him no support." The Ambassador is " not at all inclinecl to depreciate the somewhat "voluminous correspondence which contains the "result of his researches- and remonstrances." Of course, the gist of the. defence is that, although - the Ambassador had taken no notice of General Wnijws) . he had done everything that had been requested. Tito 'this question we cannot enter at present, but we believe the plea to be totally without foundation ; the fact is perfectly plain. that General Wumi"s!s wants were not supplied, and if even under the pressure of Lord C sAnDoies despatches a few suggestions were made to the PouTE, yet there is, as every one acquaint6ed with the East knows, a wide difference between a formal and an eamnest representation. If everything was not effected, it was, says Lord STRuAoRD, the fault of the Turkish Ministers. He regrets the little progress made, " but," continues his Excellency, in his happiest diction, " the well known proverb which contrasts the faci" lity of bringing a horse to water with the inm"poslibility of forcing him to. lrink is no less "true at Constantinople than in London or Pais. "lUnforfunately, too, the horses whose reluctance "I have to overcome are not without eircum" stances to excuse, though not entirely to "justify, the slowness of their pace.".. Then follows a comparison between the Turkey of to-day and the England of past times in rzespect to corrupticn. "Rave we never "heard of BAcoN or uLBououaonr? Are not "the denunciations of BuuEx ringing in our "ears ?" Lord STRATFORD is sorry for Turkish indolence. " But can I wonder? No !" It may be some gratification to our countrymen to find their language wieldeda with such power by our military and diplomatic authorities in the East, but in a case like this a little more attention to details would have been satisfactory. The concluding sentence of the despatch will give a notion of the trustworthiness of his Excellency's general defence. Re alleges two reasons for not writing,-first, that he had intended to give one long answer to the 124 despatches and letters; secondly, that, though he thought sometimes of writing, the unpunctuality of the Trebizonde packet prevented him. This packet leaves the Bosphorns every week, and, though sometimes she may be delayed 24 hours, every one else could, and did Write. Lord STRATFORD must indeed presume on the ignorance of us at home when he makes so boldly faJlacious an excuse. If anything were necessary to convince the world that what is alleged agabist him is true, it would be that hejhas recourse to such a misstatement. We knew be-. fore that he was irritable and.vindictive; we are now compelled to say that he can show himself on a great occasion very insufficiently studious of accuracy.
Lord GRXY last night raised a discussion in the House of Peers upon the Militia question. It is a little late in the day to inquire whether the Militia be the best form of adding to the strength of our national defences in opposition to the system of increasing the standing army. Whether the decision of Parliament be right or wrong,. that decision exists; it has been acted upon, and we are engaged in war. Surely, it is t o_ ia-lter our front when -we are actually in the presence of the enemy. If in days to come, whenL peace has been- restored to the world, and serious modifications in our military arrangements can more safely be made, Lord GnEr can induce Parliament to adopt his views, that may be all well enough, but now we. must continue, as we h*ave begun. Independently of this, which is a consideration of general policy, there are not wanting reasons drawn from recent experience which may indiue us to persevere in a systeuL which has hitherto been found eminiently successful. As was mentioned last night by Lord PAruRB in his answer to Lord GRLY, "the Militia has of its own " voluntary efforts given to this country very " nearly 27,000 troops." More than this, the Militia has sent twelve of its regiments to the Mediterranean gar=isons, and has thereby freed twelve regiments of the line for active servic e at the seat of war. There can be but .little doubt that in a short time, under steady drill and regulix garrison duty, these Militia regiments will be all but equal, for military purposes, to reOgular troops. Their services are willingly given. They are not conscripts or impressed men, but actually volunteers, who would, no doubt, be perfectly willing to take their tun before the fire of the enemy if the safety of the empire required the sacrifice. No such demand will be made upon them, but there they are, in case of need, the material of good soldiers, ready for any emergency. Of the enormous draughts of volunteers fcom the Militia into the Line we need scarcely speak; they have constitated the fund upon. which we have mainly relied for the maintenance of the army in the Crimea. Although during the starving time, when all things went to destruction at the seat of war, it was said that from defect of age and want of stamina the yomng soldier who had recently arrived from England suffered most, still we must - not -forget tait t1u- or-soilder- ?erWlsie too, under exertions which were above the strength of human nature and under hardships to which no man should have been exposed. The old soldier has, no doubt, the advantage of greater endurance ia a campaign and of greater steadiness of manceuvre before the enemy. We must not, however, forget the dichtum of two very competent judges of such questions--the late Duke of WEBLINGTON and Miarshal Ni3Y-both of whom used to declare that for mere purposes of fi,ghting the young soldier was gifsed with the superior audacity. Experience may bring with it greater coolness, but it brings also greater circumspection. Another great argument in favQur of the Mlitia system, which has been confinned by experience, is that by means of it a martial spirit is inspired into the youth of England. Inthis country the wages of labour are generally highl, and the inducements to stick to the plough and the loom so great that any excitement which can be applied to the latent military ardour of the people is a great gain. This end we attain by help of the Militia. The young artisans and labourers of England can now tako their turn at the rifle or f_relock without necessarily compromising many years oftheir future lives. It is likely enougb, indeed, that they may of their own accord pass on from one step to another, but if they do so they do it willingly, ana with full knowledge of the service to be required of them. The Iarger proportion of the force embodied will natur~aDy return to their usual occupations. The Militiaman has not been io long kept away from his former trade or calling that he has forgotten his duties or his craft. The very opposite of this is the case with the regular soldier. When he has learnt to be a, soldier he has forgotteni .tobeanythingelse. The tendencywithlimisto-re- - aiu trne to the business of arms, which he has deliberately eho3 a- the AelAIbU oup9ationoftthe best years of his life.- It zhould be our policy, as it is our interest, to maint,,n in tlle soldier this opinion, so as to reap the bene?f .of the sidll and- endurance which he has acquired in the public service. There *will, no doubt, come a period when time )ill have taken something from the vigorr of his step; ?am the Jtrength of his arm, from the quiemness of hid eye, and then it should be our care to smooth Ior him the passage from militiry to -civi life. The season will have gone by when he can either acquire or practise any of the regular crafts by which daily bread is earned in this land of competition. There can, however, be no doubt that the Militia system has this doub.le advantage,-that on the one hand it is connected with civil, on the other with nailitary life. The bilk of the Militiamen. are re-absorbed into the labouring population of the country without any serious injury to themselves or to commerce, in consequence of their temporary absence under the colours. On the other hand, recent experience has shown that there is no recruiting-sergeant like your Militia Colonel. It is he who has filled with young soldiers the ranks of the regular armny luring the conflict in which we are at present engaged. The drill in the Militia is the same as in the Line. If the younger levies are not as thbroughly trained at first to their work as the old soldiers, neither would they have been so had they been exclusively raised for the regular army. Thus, then, we will leavethe questionfor thepresent. What the result of our adoption of the Mlilitia system has been we k now, and it. is satisfactdry enough. It is, of course, possible that the policy which Earl CG-B advocates might also have had its advantages,, but they must have been considerable indeed had they helped us in our hour of need more than the institution of the Militia has done. It is obvious to any person who travels through the country towns of England, or who will be at the pains of visiting Aldershott, that the 3ilitia system has actually given us, independently of the Crimean volunteers and the Mediterranean- garrisons, a very numerous body of young men who can be readily turned into good soldiers, if they are not good soldiers already. Meanwhile, they constitute all the mrilitary defence for which we have any real occasion at home, and, should peace. be restored, they caun return to their usual occupations without injury from their term of service. Surely this is a somewhat strong case in favour of the Militia.

- UNYEER.ITY IZTELLMGENCE. n,vrlT?Rn 7 r> In a-Convoiistin haiA ,- .vi; cioc]k, the Professor ane craven Eratute was put to the vote. Theattendance of members was large, amounting, when the house was llest, to abovelS0. There were veryfew non-residents present. The statute was carried with regard to most of its provisions by large majorities, vasying from 35 to 70. Two clauses only were rejected. The first of these concerned the Regius Professorship of Cvil Law, the endowment of which it was proposed to increase to GO.. per annum on condition of the Professor residing and performinrgdutiessimilarto-those of the other Professors. This change was opposed by the 3Master of 'University in a short speech. He argued that it would prevent men fit for the position from accepting it, and suggested that any increase in the endowment ought to come from the Crown. The clause was negatived on a division by 96 votes to 30. The other adverse vote was on the )roposal to confine the right of voting for the Margaret Professor to resident members of Congrega-ion, which was rejected by 100 votes to 29. On one point there was an extremely close division, but the proviso of the statute was carried. This was on the requisition that the Professor of Anatomy shall be required to he a member of Convocation, or, in ether words, to have signed the Thirty-nine Articles, which was opposed by Dr. Daubeney, the Professor of Botany,, in a humorous and effective speech, anid only carried by two voices, there being in favour of it 41, and ag- it 39 votes. The same proposition in the case of the Arabic Professor was carried by 49 votes to 26. The Craven Statute passed by 57 to 13. The clause establishing a test for all Professors in the shane of a declaration of church membership, which excited he chief interest, was carriedby 94 votes to26. IIn a Congregtion held immediately afterwards, the statute placing the musical studiesof the University on anew basis was submitted to the house in four votes. All were passed except the last, which provided that a sum might be granted from the Univerity chest towards the expenses of performing exercises of more than commuon mert. This -was rejected by 13 votes-there being in favonr of it 23, and against it 36. The first and second clauses were also opposed, but were carried-the former by G1 votes to 24, and the latter by 45 votes to 15. On the thlird clause there was no division. Two statutes of a merely formal character, which have been slightly amended by the Council, were promulgated afresh. and the Congregation was dissolved by the ViceChancellor. Yesterday, at 2 o'cloclc, Mr. Monk, the organist of St. Peter's, Radley, performed a musical exercise for the degree of Doctor of Music in the Sheldonian Theatre. There was a most numerous attendance, and the principal parts of the performance were warmly atppluded.
A Cabinet Council was held yesterday afternoon at the Foreign-office, Downing-street. The Ministers present were-Viscount Palmerston, the Mariquis of Tjaiisdovie, Sir George L§rey,>- M.. -Soorei Lnbouchere, tihe Chancellor of the Eschequer, Sir Charles Wood, the Ri,ght Hon. R.

SECOND EDITJOYi- UTZ TIA7S O.FFIC13, rklayMo'7ng. ; EXPRESS FROM PARIS. - The folo1wing is the letter of our Paris core,spondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.M.- The Congress met this day at 2 o'clock, and res mained in deliberation some hours. The blundering of the Belgian press 'ill, I siI1V pose, act as a warning when the Conferenoes sIre: agsin in question. The powers of invention HV11: probably be moxe sparingly exercised for some days- to come, and simplicity itself will be alive to ins-1:. position. Since the canard of Saturday about thr' defmitive signing- of the preliminaries of peace, no *bird of the species-hardly the smallest duckling- has been on the wing, and the public seem for thepresent so disposed to. incredulity that truth itself- would hardly be believed until it stood the test, of two or three days' undisputed existence. The fact is, the secret of the Conferences is extremely well kept, better than has ever been known in a - -case - where 12 or 14 people participate; anad :they who profess to give exact details of the sittings - do so entirely on conjecture founded on a few wonl. let drop in general conversation. The absence of any allusion in the French speech from the Thronie to so important an act as that alluded to might be, considered as a proof that nothing more than wht:t I mentioned the day immediately after the firat meeting of the Congress had taken place. All that; can now be - safely said of the Conference held last Tuesday is that its proceedings were said: to be of a more satisfactory naturo than tl;e, previous ones, and that England and France con- w tinue united more closely, if possible, than befoxe. From that fact- it may be fairly inferred that the Russian Plenipotentiaries begin to see all hope of 7 disuniting them vanish, and are gradually abandon.- , ing the ground they may have taken up, and are disposed to make concessions on vital points which1 they hitherto may have contested. But that thosa points relate to Nicholaieff, Rars, Bomarsund, the neutralization of the Black Sea, the Transcaucasianfortresses, or the Principalities, we cannotsay. Thie,. 12 Burleighs who are deciding in secret council oa-: the peace of Europe do not speak of what they do ;-. and, in this complete silence, it is hazardous to in-, terpret their occasional shakes of the head in any', very precise manner. Some people argue that the more Russia is in- - clined to concede the less is she sincerely desirous of - a peace that will be durable. This may be the caset, but it can only be speculative. It is true that there is little in her history which can be alleged in favour of fidelity to her engagements. Of all the Sove-. reigns who have reigned in Rusia, Alexander I. -. cited as the modelof chivalrous goodfaithas of mode., ration. His boasted moderation did not, hows-ver, prevent him from conquering Finland, Bessarabia,, Prussian Poland, and vast districts in Asia. I doubt;. whether his good faith was much superior to hir.' moderation. Immediately after the treaty of - Presburg, which followed th.e battle of Austerlits, he, - lost no time in seeldng out a new allv, in order to recommence hostilities, and he profited skldfully oE - the discontent of Prussia. He came in person tol Berlin, roused the resentment of the King, and ther just hatred of the Queen; and on the tomb of theGreat Frederick the tWo Sovereigns swore by a wole.n oath to the new alliance against France. The war again commenced, and the Prussians were vanquished near jena. The chivalrous Ozar made no great efforts to save his ally; and after the twio battles of Eylau and Friedland, Alexander conclucled peace at Tilsit. Can it be said that he was actuated by sincerity and good faith when he yielcded to the seductions of the genius of Napoleon t It is, - at-all events, certain that he forgot the oaths srorn at Potsdam, and that he felt no scruple in abandon- - ;"n isiaally or his dupe. Every treaty -ot alliance is offensive and defensive and it involireth1 ocaguaw-i or . t-u. ritory of allies; and yet the magnanimous, chival. toMs, and loyal Alexander abandoned by that treaty one half of the Prussian territory, without sharin in the smallest degree - the sacrifice imposed on his friend. Re did more; he stipulated, for his own. advantage, the cession of a part of the Prussian. territory, the district of Bialistok, with7a population of 400,000 souls, and thus shared in despoiling tha Sovereign an alliance with whom, he had sanctified by an oath. If, then, Alexander be the very, impersonation Of fidelity to engagements, and the model of moderation, what notion can-ve form of the other Sovereigns of Russia 7 Or what cam be thought of the stupidity of Prussia, who seeks the alliance of a Power who, if- an opportunity offered, would be among the first to despoil her ? The old - King did not the less give his daughter to the brother of Alexander, 'and the reigning King does not the less sacrifice the honour of his crown and the security of his states to an allince 'with this per- fidious family. With such examples before them - our statesmen mill not allow themselves +o be deceived by the flatteries of her diplomatists -no morae than the nation they represent has been intimidated by her power. When Russia cannot bully she cheats, and the opinion passed by Napoleon on the duplicity of his formner friend stands goodcfor his successors. mIr.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENBE. FRANCE. (FRO.m OU OWN1 CORRESPONDEDT.) (A portion of the following appeared in our second edition of yesterday:-1 PARIS, WEDNESDAY, rA.ICH 5, 6 P.M. The following is the eaTposg des inotifs of the budget of 1857, presented to the Legislative Body yesterday:- " Gentlemen,-The Emperor has desired that the budget for the year 1857 should be presented to you at the beginming of yo-ir session. Wre in consequence sabmit to your examination the estimate of receipts and expenses for that year. As you know, gentlemen, the year 1855, which has a jlust terminated, shows a large increase in the'indirect taxes and revenues. Thus, in spite of three insufficient harvests, amd in the very midst of the sacrifices of a distant war, France has not interrapted for an instant the fraitfal activity of her labours, nor the increase of her internal prosperity. Calm at home, glorious abroad, henceforth assured of her alliances, after being so long isolated in Europe, and confiding in the wisdom of the Sovereign, she even now gathers the fruit of a policy at once firm and loyal, generous and prndent. As a great nation which, after tho terrible trials and prolonged conflicts of a revolution, has at last found her place, she has seen the sympathies of the world return to her, and, enjoying nnder the national dynasty of lNapoleon f11. the real advantages of the new order she has conquered, she has at the same time resumed without an effort the rank which belongs to her among the nations of Europe. However, it is to strong governments and prudent financiers that it belongs not to estimate too highly the hopes of the future. You will remark, gentlemen, that the estimate of the receipts for the new year has been made with prudent reserve in the law which we now submit for your apprbaation. "BUDGET OF RZECIPTS. "The fortunate results of the year 1855, to which are joined the hopes of peace which it is now permitted to entertain, would perhaps seem to authorize a high estimate of the receipts. But the Government has not thought so. Contrary to the course followed in later times, and though events have thus jus'ified the hopes of onr budgets, it has considered that it would beproperto confine itself withinthe limit of the receipts realized in 1855 and of the estimates admitted by you for 185G. The irndirect taxes and revenue4 on which is concentrated almost exclusively the question of the estimates, figured in the budget of receipts for the year 1855 at 891,756,O5Of. The budget of 1854, voted by you last year, estimated them at 929,699,OOOf. The receipts of. 1855 reached, for the old duties, only 922,474,000f. The new taxes voted in your Iast session, but as a temporary measure only, have produced for part of the year 1855 33,000,O0Of., and will give for the whole year 1856 83,000,O0Of. It is on this certain basis that the estimates which are proposed to you for 1857 repose. It has, how. ever, appeared right to increase bya favourable estimate the yield of the duty on potable liquors, remaining however below the estimates admitted by the budget of 1856. In fact, we may hope that the accidental causes which have lowered the amount of that tax will not be reproduced in 1857. A similar observation has caused an increase to be set down in the receipts from the duty on the manufacture of native sagar. Finally, the normal increase in the proceeds of the tobacco duties has been taken into account, but without exceeding for 1857 the estimates of the budget of 1856. Thus, the total produce of the indirect taxes and revenaes for the whole of the old and new duties will be set down in the budget of 1857 at 1,031,010,000f. " BUDGET OF EXPENSES. "The budget of the year 1857' presents an increase of expenses of 96,770,63Gf. The llinistry of Finance, the Minis. try of Public Works, and the Ministry of the Interior share, unequally, almost the whole of this increase. The credits accorded to the Ministry of Finance for the year 1856 are on the whole 771,798,OOOf. The credits demandea forl1S57 amountto848,228,064f. There resultsfor 185Tanincrease of expenses of 77,861,749f., partly cempensated, however, bya reduction of 3,432,585f., and thus the increase is in reaity 76,429,164f. In this augmentation the public debt alone figures for 52,762,21'1f. The restitutions, negative values, and premiums on tlhe exportation of merchan. dise are set down for a sum of about 18,000,O0Of.; it is the exact amount of that expense, w;ich, however, is not a real expense; but it has been thought right, from the experience of the last few years, to put it down at once at its real amount, which bas never been done before. Then come the survdisciwe of the cultivation and the increase in the mnanufacture of tobacco for more than 4,000,OOOf., and finally ; small augmentation in the expense of collecting the taxes and revenues. The Ministry of Public Works receives a grant greater by 14,491,559f. 'than that of 1856; and 14,478,001f. of the increase arise from the engagements contracted by the State with the railway companies. Th6cre dits of the Ministry of the Interior increase by 3,979,140F., viz., 2,507,600f. for the departmental, and 1,471,540f. for the general service. The first of these expenses is the neoessatY consequence of the special laws which have authorized extraordinary taxes. The second reslts principally from the augmentation in the ordinary expenses, and the cost of conveyingprisoners condemned by the courts of law, andlikewise of the extension of the telegraphic servie. In fine, gentlemen, the comparison of the receipts and expenses presents a surplus of receipts of 15,417,348f. That amount may appear small when compared with the total of supplementary credits which each year has seen produced, andagainst whichthefacultyof transfering fromoneMinisterial department to another has not been hithorto, parhaps, a-sufficient remedy. But the Government of the Emperor hopes more and more to restrict the supplementary credits, and to confine, them to rare cases, that is to say, to wants realy urgent and which could not have beenforeseen. We may also hope that the real amount of the expenditure of the year having been at once truly stated, as is the case in the present instance, will enable us to make a still greater reductionin the supplemea-. tarycredits. Finally, gentlemen, the strictness of the estimate, as regards the receipts of the year 1857, warrants ourbelief thattheresourcesofthe yearwill,inpoitoffact,exceed the estimates, and lead to that final balance of income and expenditure which is'the desired object of your efforts and of ours; a result, nevertheless, difficult of attainment, especially when our annual oxpenses comprise considerable sums devotedtogreatpublicworks, fruitfulinvestments-in fact, insuring future wealth, but weighing without compensation on the present time. "E. BOINVILLIER, President of tho Section of Finance. "CAMILLE GODELLE, Councillor of State. "A. VUITRY, Councillor of State."

The motion which the Left Side of the Efouse of Deputies has within the last few days introduced, for calling upon the Government to take the present opportunity of procuring from Russiaa thorough reform of the present prohibitive and exclusive system observed towards Prussia, wil doubtless be based upon the very strong ground that the present state of things is in direct violation of the various treaties that have been made since 1815 for the modification or development of the general principles laid down for the international traflic of Poland and its neighbouring, countries at the Congress of Vienna. A reference to the course of history previous to the Congress of Vienua would show how Russia, in the three partitions of Poland that took place in tho latter -half of last century, contrived to get for her share 9,000 square leagues of teriitory with a population of 5,800,000, while Austria got 2,000 square leagues of land with 3,700,000 population, and Prussia got 2,700 square leagues and a population of 2,500,000. Further, it would show that from the beginning of this century up to the close of the Vienna Congress in 1S15 it had contrived to obtain, at the expense of Prassia and Austria, all that territory that now com-Doses the present kingdom of Poland; this would, however, be beside my present object of showing the terns on which on that occasion Russia agreed that the coinunercial intercourse of the present kingdom of Poland with its late proprietors should be regulated. Itwasthenoble sentiments ofthe Emperor4lexander and the magnanimous plans he put forward for the preservation of the remains of a Polish nationality that led the other States represented at the Congress to acquiesce in the enormous acquisition of territory that Russia made at the expense oI Austria and Prussia, the former of whom had till then possessed the south-east portion of the present kdngdom of Poland nearly up to the gates of Warsaw, under the name of West Galicia, while the rest of the kingdom, including the capital, Warsaw, and its Ute-de-pod, Praga, belonged to Prussia. This final partition of Poland, in which Russia under these line-sounding pretences, that have never been fulfilled, obtained more than the lion's share, was in direct opposition to the. treaties of Kalisch and Reichenbach, which she had concluded with Prussia and Austria in 1813; and it was equally opposed to the express agreement of thesesthree Powers that Russia induced the Congress to sanction theEmperor's assum- ingthe title of King of Poland, which the three Powers had contracted among themselves, in 179T, neither of them should ever assume. It wras, however, in conformity with the noble views and intentions expressed by the Emperor Alexander forthe preservation of the Polish nationality, under the protection of Russia, that the present Idngdom of Poland was, according to the treaty of May 3,1815, to have its own system of Customs, &c., apart from Russia; it was to remain a fiscal individuality; Russia woulld even add to it the old Polish territory she had acquired before the end of the previous century; the navigation of the rivers and canals was to be free, with the exception of a trifling toll for the maintenance of the way (this amount could only be altered by common consent of all three parties); transit trade was to be free, with the exception of the merest trifle as duty; the import and export duties were not to exceed 10 per cent. of the value of the goods at the place of their origin. (This was fixed in the treaty with Prussia; the Austrian -treaty only promised a revision of tariffs.) At Russia's urgent request these terms were extended, not only to the Prussian and Austrian provinces absolutely conterminous with the new kin,rdom of Poland, but to all the Prussian and Austrian territory that had formerly belonged to the ancient kingdom of Poland. Of all these various stipulations, made at the request and instance of Russia (one is almost tempted to believe for the purpose of disarning the opposition of the rest of Europe), not one single one has ever been observed by her. A miixed comnimission in Warsaw did, it is true, in 1816 elaborate a tariff for the kingdom of Poland, the ancient Polish provinces of Russia,and the Polish provinces of Prussia, in conformity with the treaty of 1813; but the opposition it met with in St. Petersburg prevented its ever being put into force. It was not till the close of 1818 that a commercial treaty was concluded between the kingdom of Poland (without the ancient Polish provinces of Russia) and the kingdom of Prussia; the taiff here ai-ranged was moderate and promised to conduce to the mutual prosperity of the commercial coastland of East and West Prussia and the agricultural inland of Poland. One stipulation of this treaty was that the tariff should only be altered by mutual consent of Russia aud Prussia; on March 12, 1822, however,-just two years and a quarter after it had come intoforce,-Russia issued of her sole authority a new tariff for the two countries, drawn upon the strict prohibitive, exclusive systeni of the Russian tariff. March 11, 1825, a fresh treaty of commerce was concluded between Russia (for Poland) and Prussia, in which, after reciting simply that "the treaty of December, 1818, had lapsed," a fresh tariff, on the basis of the Russian prohibitory system, was concluded for nine years. These zit117 year Itave since thenu olapsed, aild by tho en~A ef the treaty the original conditionS of the troatxf lifay, 1815, should have come into force at its determrination; imstead of which, Poland has been foamally incorporated into Russia as regardsa Customs.; it is no longer a fiscal individuaLity, But hasbecome psrt and parcel of the Ru3sian fiscal empire, and ig: subjected to the " barring out" systerm of the rest of Russia. Eeavy Customs dues, amounting to prohibitior, excessive transit dues by land and by water, vexatious police and passport regulations, have a-I but aunhiIlated the traffic between districts that formerly were bat one country; the Prussian Baltir littoral (East and West Prussia) is deprived of th3 import trade it ought to transact for inland Poland; the manufacturers of Silesia, whose most natural vent for their produce was the neighbouring PoTund, have been ruined and the whole province impoverished. The various trades thatformerlyfound theircustomersinPoland have either ceasedto exisE or have sought out other and less remunerative channels. The province of Silesia has become to Prussia what Ireland was for so long to England-. a constant open sore, where extensive landownera and a starving peasantry, Roman Catholicism, ignorance, idleness, and penury fester togethei'without hope or prospect of improvement; shut iIt by Russian Poland and Atustria, it has no hope oL~ trade except by underselling other nations in foreignL markiets. Whether this is likely to beremunerativo English manufacturers can best judge. But while the prohibitory system of Russia has destroyed every honest trade in East and West Prussia and Silesia, it has given rise to another thai; occupies, it is true, a vast number of hands, and! leads to considerable, but dishonest gains. Smuggling is carried on there systematically, and about to the same extent as in Spain; numerous bodies of armed men escort extensive caravans, and are ready to do battle on any occasion of being surprised bythe, Preventive Guard stationed on either side of the, frontier. In the attempts made on the part of Russia to suppress this contraband trade by force it; frequently happens that the Prussian frontier is; violated, that Prussian property is injured, and that Prussian subjects are carried off in custody over thet frontier, to be tried by Russian laws. It requires no words to show to what frequent and acrimonious reclamation this gives rise on the part of this Government; nor need I add that in these, as on almost every other occasion, they are fruitless. In addition to the military and police authorities, in both counmries, -kept eternally on the qui niri by this smuggling trade is a vast train of civil employes, whose chief occupation is the surveillance of the frontier intercourse, on the part of the Russians to prevent disaffected or suspected Poles from returning home, and to prevent those still resident there from quitting the country as long as they ara amenable to Russian military service, on the part of Prussia to prevent the influx of Polish Jews and Polish riff-raffof all sorts, andto apprehend all and every Russian subject who cannot show his papers perfectly cn r4le. There exists between Russia and Ptussia a cartel treaty by which each country undertakes to deliver up to the other any runaways and deserters from military service (this cartd ex-c pires this year); it is needless to remark--that the Prussian authorities have to apprehend and hand over about 100 Russian for one Prussian deEnquent that the Russians have to pass back, though I by no mneans desire to assert that military service is exactly an object of desire to the bulk of Prussians. In addition to prohibitory Customs, to a vexatious passport police, to the lawlessness of a smuggling population, and the continued harass from the extradition of miltary runagates in virtue of the CartC, all which evils are chronic and settled, there comes from time to time, as has been the case now ever since the beginning of last December, a " barring out" on the part of Prussia of all frontier intercourse with Poland or Russia, as the case may be, in the hope of preventing the introduction of murrain among the cattle, or glanders and strangles among the horses. For this purpose military, and even civil patrols of the inhabitants, are posted onx every road and footpath, whose instractions are to prevent all intercourse with Polanad, " specially to ex. clude allcattle, skins, or other products of cattle, and all persons whose avocations bring them into contact with cattle; and, above all, all Polish and Russian Jews not perfectly en regle with their papers." The only exception to this prohibition is the postwagen, or official stage-coach, and its passengers. In the middle of Last month this system of patrollng on the murrain preventive service produced a victim in the person of a young Polish girl, who, probably through ignorance, left the prescribed path when going to meet her lover, and was shot on the spot by the soldier on duty. Close by the theatre of this domestic tragedy it has been arranged of late, as a special alleviation of the distress produced by this sanitary measure for the exclusion of murrain, &c., that waggons bringing corn from Poland may draw up along the banks of the river wvhich forms the frontier, and the sacks of corn are then brought and deposited in the centre of the bridge over the stream. When the Poles have withdrawn to the appointeddistance the-Prussians approach the sacks, empty. their contents into fresh sacks of their own, and in. turn wvithdraw. Almost ridiculous as these precautions appear, they are said by persons informed on the subject not to be ulnecessarily strict, considering the ease with which these cattle diseases are conveyed even by human beings or inanimate objects. It is only with wheat that all this trouble is taken; that is the only kdnd of grain the exportation of which is permitted from Poland. Since the commencement of February the export of all fresh, salted, and smoked meat from Poland has been prohibited, as weUl as from Russia. Before I conclude this pleasant picture of the amenities of a frontier intercourse with Russia I wil add a sketeh of another kind. At the market at Thorn this last January, where last year Polish buyershad been so plentiful that the se31ers had been set uap for half the year, there was not a single creature came over the frontier. The only visitors from across the frontier come over to beg, borrow, or steal. Persons living in the open country are often attacked in their houses or on the highways. One band of these marauders is 15 strong, so that the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages are compelled to keep watch and ward by turns.
THE BOYAL EDMONfTON BIFLES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-All who take an interest in thehonest administra. tion and consequent efficiency of the tIlitia must have read with satisfaction the discussion raised by the member for West Surrey, in the louse of Commons last night. respecting the Edmonton Rifles. 2dr. Byng's statement, that the officers, including himself. had felt considerable disappointment at their long and inglorious state of inactivity, would have appeared less stranga if their influence with Government had not been notoriously quite strong enough to procure the embodiment of tha regiment at any momuent. Can any man in his senses believe that Lord Salisbury's attention has not been often drawn to the anomaly, tha e.stence of which Mr. F. Peel was obliged to admit? Can anyone doubt that one word from Lord Enfield would hava. procured for the regiment the small modicum of training comprised in 28 days ? In the noble families of the Cecils and the Byngs it is well known that " differences of (political). opinion hava never altered friendship." -Lord Palmerstones lecture to lhr. Layard and his eulogy of Militia officers generally were only calculated to distract attention from the question at issne. Everyone seems to admit that tbe officers of the MElitia do their duty well. No one objects to their being mainly selected from the best and most influential familios in the respective counties. It is only when their interest is used to the detriment instead of to the advansage of the public service that appointments which wvould otberwise have commanded approbation assume a totally different complexion, and ara stigmatized as jobs. It remains to be seen whether a successful appeal, or any appeal, will now be made to Lord Salisbury to issue orders for the embodiment of this regiment, -which, if embodied, might mnake up for lost time, and perhaps relieve some other regiment which bad been doing duty for the last two years. I am. Sir. y-our verv obedient servant. SUBURBANUS. March 1. .

SHE DESTRUCTION OF COVENT-G.ARDEN THBATEE. During the whole of yesterday immense numbers of people were attracted to the scene of the confkgration which on the preceding morning doomed the theatre of Covent-garden to speedy and comPlete destruction; and. when it is stated that Her MIajesty, her Royal Consort, and the Princess Royal Were among the visitors to the ruins in the course of the day, as well as several members of the nobility and aristocracy, including, among others, the Duchess of Wellington, the Duke of Bedford, the 31arquis of Lansdowne, Lady Feel, Lord Ward, LJord oMIlve, Lord Mareus Hill, Lord Elcho, and Mr. Hardinge, M.P., some idea may be formed of the deep and general interest which this ealamitous event has awakened among all classes of the inhabit-ats of the metropolis. Her Mxjesty and the Princess Royal arrived about 4 o'clock, attended by Lady Churchill, the Lady in Widting, Mfajor-General Buckley and Captain the Hon. Dudley de Ros, as Equerries. The Royal party approached the theatre by way of Hart-street, andl alig,hted inPrince's-place, in whichHer Majes7ty's priva.te entrance was situate. There they were received by 3r. Gye, the lessee of the building, who hadc arrived irom Paris in the course of the morning, and conducted to a position which commanded an advantageous vies of the ruins. To reach this point Eer MIajesty and the Princess Royal had to pass through a portion of a lobby connecting the Roval Courtyard with the Piazza entrance to the pit, aiad strewn over witn a mass of charred rumins, through which they had to pick their steps with some care. They were conducted through alow-doorway in one of the interior walls to a spot near what had been the position of Her Majesty's private bo,s, from -which they obtained an excellent view of the rnisq, and were able to form an adequate conception of the vast area originally covered by the building, and the melancholy scene of desolation and destruction which it now presents. After asking Mrk. Gye a few questions, and addressing a graceful e.xpession of her sympathy to him, Her 3Iajesty, the Princess Royal, and the Royal suite left the theatre and returned to Buckinghaml Palace. Shortly after 5 o'clock his Royal Highness Prince Albert, attended by Colonel Phipps and Captain the Hon. Dudley de Ros, drove up in aprivate cariage to the Royal entrance in Prince's-place, and on alighting were received by Mr. Gye, and conducted to the spot from which the Queen and the Princess Royal had just inspected the rtnins. His Royal Highness spent about 20 minutes contemplating the spectacle of devastation, and then retired. Throughout the whole of yesterday barriers were thrown across both ends of Bow-street and Hartstreet, 'which form the only means of access to the theatre, sO as to divert the whole of the passenger and carriage traffic, the latter of which might endanger the external walls left standing-some of which are far from 6afe. Shores vwere erected in the course of the day to support the side of the edifice abutting upon Hart-street, from which clanger was apprehended, and policemen were stationed to prevent persons privileged to pass along that thoroughfare from loitering in a place which commanded, though not without risk, the most advantageous view of the ruins. tUp till a late hour on Wednesday night apprehensions were entertained that at least two persons had perished in the conflagration. One of the two was a boy in the service of the gasmen connected with the theatre, who had not been seen since early on Tuiesday evening, the night of the bal nzasrue, and it -was feared that he had fallen asleep from fatigue in some quiet corner of the building, and so perished in the flames. The other -was a Miss Hamilton, known to have been present at the entertainments in the theatre, who had not been heard of since the outbreak of the fire, and for 'whom the most anxious inquiries were made by her relatives during the whole of Wednesday. It is row beyond a doubt that both those persons have returned to their friends, so that, at present, this calamitous accident stands divested, by some intervention little less than marvellous, of all considerations arising from the loss of life. Some inquiries, however, have been made at the police station in Row-streetby the relatives of persons who have been mnng since the fire, and who were supposed to be present at the entertainment on Tuesday night. Ihr. Gye had been absent from this country for nearly a month, and previous to Christmas last had Iet the theatre toMri 4nderson for his sleight-of-hand entertainments and English pantomime; and subzequently, at Mr. Andersons request, gave permission to him for the performance of English opera, on condition that it was to be done by artistes of high repute. While at Madrid, he received a letter and a telegraphic message from Mr. Anderson asldng permission to use the theatre for a bctl masqug, to which he sent a refusal by telegraph, and wrote to him by post to the same effect. On Mr. Gye's arnival in Paris on Friday last he was surprised to find the bal masque advertized to take place, and he again telegraphed his refusal; but on receivinga pressingappeal from3fr. Anderson he eventually gave a reluctant consent to its being held in the theatre. Notwithstanding the accident which has befaUen the theatre and the serious loss he has sustained, alr. Gye expresses his strong determinationto cany on the Opera in one or other of the metropolitan theatres during the present season, and with that -view to maintain intact his company of artistes. The origin of the fire sill remains a subject of mystery.

An over supply of stock then caused a considerable pressUre for money, and a deeline of a quarter per cent. took place, from which there was no recovery. The first quotation of Consols for. money was 91i- to a, and they left off at 91# to i for money and 915Z for the I 10th of April. There was an absence of news, but the private advices from Paris expressed confidence that the progress towards a satisfactory termination of the Conferences has been fully as rapid as was anticipated. Consol Scrip closed 1I to J premium ; Bank Stock, 213i to 215; euced, 911 to 92; New Three per Cents., 92k to A; Long Annuities, 3 9-16; Annuities, 1855, 16 15-16 ; India Stock, 223 to 225; India-bonds, 6s. to 2. discount; Enchequer-bonds, 98 to i; and xchequer-bills(March), 2s. discount to par, (June) . s. discount to ls. premium. The transfer-books of all the stocks whose dividends are payable in April closed to-day, with the exception of the New Three per Cents., which close to-morrow. Foreign securities were steady, and continue, on the average, to be well supported. Turkish Si-x per Cents. were negotiated at 94l for money and e6 and 96 for the account. In the Guaranteed Four per Cents. the transactions were at 100k for money, and 10k for the account. The general business comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 101 ; the Small, 102i; the Four-and-a-HWalf per Cents., 92A; Buenos Ayres, 56i; Cuba Seven per Cents. (Matanza and Sabanilla), 100; Chilian Six per Cents., 104 and 102; the Three per Cents., 68; Danish Five per Cents., 100k; Granada New Active, 22 and 22A; the Deferred, 7X; Mexican, for the account, 20% and k; Russian Five per Cents. 101j ; Sardinian Five per Cents., 901, 90, and 90k; Spanish New Deferred, 238 and J; the Certificates, 5 percent.; and Venezuela, 29 imd 28. Out of the 362,0001. of gold lbrought bythe James Baines, 120,0001. has already been taken to the Bank of Englalhd, and it is possible a further sum may yet find its way there. The Frenchl rate of exchange continues favourable for this country, and hence the purchase of the amounts of gold taken within the last few days for the Bank of France must have involved a heavy loss. The pressure for money, however, in Paris, consequent upon the speculative mania, is such that any sacrifices are borne for the moment to prevent a check being given to public confidence. The final prices -of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 72f. 40c. for money, and 73f. 10c. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of more than a quarter per cent. A petition about to be presented to the House of Commons by holders of Westminster Improvement -Bonds has just been printed, and lies for signature at the office of 3Mr. Ogle, the late chairman of the committee of inqutiry, 4, Great Winchester-street. This docunment purports to embody a succinct narrative of the proceedings of the commission, and, after sliowing the manner in which the public were betrayed by the extraordinary powers grnted to these persons by Parliament, and also the neglect of duty on the part of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, it prays that a committee of inquiry may be appointed, with the view of such relief being afforded Ias may seem expedient. Copies of the petition, it is stated, are to be obtained by the bondholders on application; and, apart from the personal interest it may possess for them, it is worthy of being read as thedescription of a case of abused confidence which stands prominently Olt even among the disastrous examples of the past two years. The Royal Swvedish Railway Company have given notice, wunder the advice of the Comnmittee of Investigation, that all shares and obligations of the company are required to be left on or before Wednesday next for examination with reference to the genuineness of the signatures. The Conimittee of the Stock-Exchange had a sitting to-day respecting the securities in question; but, understandingO that this notice was about to appear, and that another meeting of the shareholders will probably be caUed before the end of the month, they deferred for the present the adoption of any resolutions. The foUlowing communication from Mexico, received by the Parana, confirms the previous advices regarding the immediate probability of a successful counter-revolution aud a continuance of anarchy, -which will end only in the utter extinction of the nation as an independent Power. An immediate attack on the capital by the insurgents under Haro y Tamariz was expected, and, as the army as well as the clergy are against the Government, by whom their privileges have been suddenly swept away without caution or preparation of any kind, scarcely even a show of resistance appeared probable. Meanwhile, although all legal claims are dishonoured, money continued to be squandered by the 3Iinisters, apparentlywithan increased recklessness in proportion to the instability of theirposition; and the new tariff, whvich was ready -for promulga tion, was Suspecd to be delyed in order that individuals might profit by a previous knowledge of it. The remarks at the commencement of the letter regarding the proceedings of General Gadsden, the United States Minister, deserve particular notice, after the recent attempts of the Government at Washington to iasten a quarrel upon England for an unintentional infringement of their neutrality laws - "The state of the countty is becoming really desperate, and it is evident now that, unless soiae wholly unlooked-for circumstance should arise, these wealthy regions must soon fall a prey to the ambitioa of their neighbours. The Mexicans are totally unable to cope with external intrigues, more especially in the constant state of disturbance in which they lhve fromn their interrninable dissensions, which are natualy fostered and encouraged by the Amenicans. The active part taken by the American Minister in the Last revolution was so notorious that it attracted universal notice, and on his part General Gadsden seemed so little anxious to dissemble his connexion vith the revolutionary party that he gave - aidro thine o the corps diplrovsioqu amnple opportnitiea to judge for themselves. aThe present Government, however, is not likely to last long, and the fresh revolutioy streck up by liaro is ravidly advaning tonwards a eavouraly1b ttrninition.

Haro, who is now leading the I'ronunciado. Trhe sub. division of the Mexicanterritory into several p.etty republics will probably be the next step taken., whicht will pave the way for .aradua1 annexcation. "In tie meantime the old system of plunder continuesi in full vigour, and the soi-disast. Liberals who are now at the head of affairs seem to vie with the dictatoripa governiment of General Santa A nna in their eagerness to emnpty the public coffers into their own pockets. 'he National Guard has furnished.thelm with a fresh pretext for spending largo sums of money in a very doubtful manner, while thl most onerous and scandalous contracts are made and carried out in spite of the pretended penury which is constantly pleadea by all Mexican Governments as an excuse for not paying their debts. In fact, the only hope for the bondholders, as well as other British creditors, Is that Her Majesty's Go- vernment may be induced to take more energoti measares for the protection of their rights and property. AUl manner of payments have been stopped, at the same time that great extravagance is shon in ine uniforms for the National Guard, &c.; but, as Mexican 31inisters generally remain a very short time in office, they care very little aboat raising difflculties which they expect, to bequeath to their successors, and they seem very anxious to male hay while the sun shimes. "The new tariff is about to be published at last; bht, though it has been -in print for some time, it wi probably remain secrettill the packet courier is despatched, m order that-those only who enjoy especial favour may take undue advantage of the change by gaining time. "Exchange on London, 44d. to 45d. per dollar." Annexed is a memorandum from the Committee of Mfexican Bondholders . "The committee have advices from Mr. Whitehead dated Mexico, the 2d ult., but the packet brings no remittances for the dividend fund. The British Consul in Vera Cumz writes that as regards the $45,O00 which could not be shipped by the preceding packet, and were then lodged with him for safe custody, he had met with unexpected. difficulties in obtaining the permit required to send them by he present packet, and had referred to Her Majesty's Minister in lexico on the subject. The agents in Tampico report that they were unable to make-any remittance because the expected supply -of hard dollars had not yet reached that port, in consequence of the conducta having been delayed in San Luis Potoas.. Affairs generaly in Mexico continued im a very unsatisfactory state, and the diffieulties which the Government had to contend with were immense. The President had, by decree of 21stof January last, abolished the tobacco monopoly, which lIad of late produced $600,00 annually, and ordered the sale byspublic auction ofthe stock on han His Excellency the Minister of Finauce sends the committee (without comment) a copy of the new tariff of the 31st of Januarylast, which was to take effect from the day of i publication, but which at the date of Mr. Whitehead's letter (2d ut.l lsd not aparently been published yet in Meiico. Article 11 of this law contains the following paragraph:-' In addition to these rates of duty on import, 25 per cent. more is to be paid into the national Treasury in bonds of the public Consolidated Debt.' It is not explained whether these bonds are to be of the Foreign as well as of the Domestic Debt, but the committee presumes such to be the intentiou; nor, if that be so, what proportion of each is to be paid, and whether at par, or at what other rates. No Mexican newspapers have been received by this mail." Meetings of the Iberian and Peninsular Mining companes were held to-day, at which the reports and accounts detailing progress were adopted. The directors in both cases propose to proceed vigorI ously with operations, and in the foxmer a further small call has been made. The following are from mining companies CMARIQf1Q'rA. The company have received advices, of which the folloVIiDg is an abstract :-Santa An& Mines for the Month of eeciaber.-Cost $7,102; returns, ;13,671. harmato Mines for the Month of november.-Cost, $14,462; returns, $17,800.

"Th. directors have advices from their sraelting establishientsin Chili by the Parana. From Herradura melting Works, under date the 15th of January, MIr. Barnes reports that the stock-taking was nearly complete. Smelting would be speedily resumed, and he had already begun makiDg contracts for ores for the new year, and had secured a sufficient supply of all descriptions of ores, although he was endeavourmug to reduce the large stocks on hand. He had reorganized the staff from the beginning of the year, and discharged several men of bad character and habits. From Caldera Smelting Works advices are to the 1Tth of January. All going on well. Mr. ltodbard reports that he was reducing the working, in order to increAse the establishment at Herradura. From Tongoy advices are to the 15th of January. The furnace was not relighted; ores were coming in freely. The steamer Anne was on the 15th at Herradura; her machinery is in good order." According to the circular of Messrs. Thomas Southey and Son, the wool sales just terminating have comprised 45,538 bales, of which the proportions were-11,655 Sydney, 8,462 Port Phillip, 2,096 Tasmania, 1,900 South Australin, 1,277 New Zealand, 37 Swan River, 17,633 Cape of Good Hope, and 2,478 East Indian. The lowness of stocks in the manufacturing districts, as well as on the continent, led to an active competition, and an advance has been obtained of 2. to 3d. per lb. on the average of last sales on nearly all descriptions in fair condition. Cape wools formed a large proportion, but were not in excess of the demand. It is suggested that, should a sufficient quantity of wool arrive toards the close of next month, it would seem desirable to declare very early sales, as the wants of all parties will be great, and the period would be convenient for foreign buyers.

The Levent trade is duUl, the advices receo*ed by the Greek houses lhere irom Constantlnople and Alexandria being to thoe fibet that taocks a.re accumulating under a mnuch modified do-, n1and, and tIat prices are giving way, while the exchange is aL9o against shippers fom this market. TUB Rum s s CoMrA1 Y.-Yecterday was publishedc a ser ies of papers relating to tho fornmation of tho " Russia Coamn any" in EliglIand. It appears that letters patont wero granted to this comnpany by Ph ilip and Mary, in the firat and second year.s of their reign; Anl act of Blizabetli incorporated it aa a perpetual body, under tho above title; anid an aetof 5.Villhsn Iii. (A.D. ifi'9)9 was pssed to extend tlo trade to Russia, and enacted that every subject of the realm seeking adiission into the company should pay ol., and no more. ''l'he duea received in London on the ilportation. of goods from Russian porharo little morethan nominal, and are not levied on trilling articles, nor are pewsOns calIed upon to become free of the company unless engaged in the Ithis. sian trade. By far the greater amount of dues is paid by members of the Court of Assistants. 'Thle Russian Comnpany Ilave an agent at St. Petersburg, and one at Elsinore, fromn whom they receivo information regarding the trade of tho two countries. Her Majesty's Consul at St. Petersburg is the coininercial agent of the compally, and derives full half his oflieial salary from this appointment. The company contribute to the maintenance of chapels in the twvo capitals of Russia, at Cronstadt, Archangel, and Solaanbal, and a school is established iri St. Petersburg under the auspices of the company, at which a thorough education is afforded under the supervision of the Rev. Dr. Law, the company's claplain. The peculiarity of the Russia Company is that It represents in England a large colony of British subjects established in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Cronstadt, and Archangel, those in the Russian capital alone amounting to 3,000, and the number constantly increasing. The Russian Company and the British factory at St. Petersburg have been always closely connected, and have been repeatedly acknowledged by the Imperial Government. Totlieprofitable carryingon ofthe Russian trade it has always been deemed essential that English houses should e6ist in Russia, and the difficelty of the language and of acquiring a knowledge of the people demand a long residence there. To sum up the advantages of the present systema, if it pro. vide a church establishment in Russia, in favour aid sapport of which British residents of all religious persuasions agree to waive their petty doctrinal differences-if, under its operation, the poor of the'increasing communitiesof British subjects are supported and the education of the young provided for,-if it afford the means of union and communication in all eases where the interests of trade may be affected by political events, then (as the paper contends) it 'would be pecuiarly undesirable at the present juncture to break up this association, which it would beimpossible to revive under another reform. The above particurs are extracted from a copy of the mnemorial presented bythe Rsia Company to the B13ard of Trade in Au* ,o18S3. Copies of the original tent and the acts of Par men bearing on the subject of tne company are appmnded to tho ie memrfl.
RAIXWWAY AND AlINING gSUAE& : _. Thursday Evening. The railway market was firm at the commenceraent of business, but sales subsequently ensued which caused in some cases a decline of from 5s. to lOs. per share. The operations were principally speculative. Australian land and banldng shares exhibited heaviness. There was also a furtiher de- line in the shares of two or three of the joint-stock banking companies. Canacla Land were negotiated at 137 and 342, and left off at that quotation.

JifDifvRSLEv-2 Thei sain qoestions raised by this isform onuwere who were the parties entitled to elect the inmates of certain almnshouses in the parish of St. Mary, 2lewington, founded. by a gentleman named John Walter in the year 1650- and also -whethel iVidnot be dlesirabe that a new scheme should beframed for the administration of the charity. The caSe now came before the Court upon the chief clerlk's certificate as to the parties in whom the present right of voting waS vested, and also to decide the question of costs. The Chief Clerk by his certjli. cate had found that the guardians and churchwardens were Inot the parties entitled to elect according to the foundation deed,theoassimptionupon which theylhad done so beinr erroneous and the question now vwas whether they sholahave their costs. The Draperse Company were trustees of the charity, and when the present question of costs was disposed of the mnatter would goback to his Honours chambers for the purpose of having a scheme settled for the future mnanagemnent of the charity. Mir. GLASsE and Mr. WEiaoRD, for the informlauts, Isought to deprive the governors and guardians of their costs, on the ground that the Chief Clerk had decided that they were not entitled to vote, 3Mr. .N'DRSOnno and fr. CoLLINS, for the governors and guardias, insisted that they were necessary parties, and had for SO years exercised the right of voting. r. Eoffman alppeared for the churchwardens; and Mr. Terrell, Mr. C. Hall, Mr. J. H. Palmer, dr. Money, an. Mr. Hemuing for the other parties; Mr. Wickens appeared for the Attorney-Generl The VICE-CHAN;CELLOR thought that the guardians ana churchwardens lhaving for so long exercised the power, although erroneously, but without evil intention, must have their costs. The cause would now go on in the usual way to, settle a scheme. (Beforc Vice-ChanceMor Sir J. STuxmTr.) FORMAN V. HUDSON. This was a bill a ainst the member for Sunderland, praying that he might be ordered forthwith to execute a mortgage of certain p%operty to toe plAintiff for Securing the snm of 2,i3fJ4J. It appeared that in order to secure the repayment Of fb§ above soul to the plaintif, the defendant, in )ecenber, , agareed by a memorandmn in writing to execute a mogage to the plaiintiff of his Whitby. estate, his house and furniture at Albert-gaets and 12L; shares in the: flunderland D)ock Compan, which were subect to a prior mortage for l45,01. The sum of 39. vas made up oi two items, and prior to, the institution of the suit the defendant expresed his readiness to execute the mortgage, on being satisfied as to both itenms. The plaintiff satisfied the defendant as to one before the bill was filed, but did not give the defendant a satisfactory explanation as to the other until after that period, the explanation having been given in one of the affidavits in the cause. The only queston was as to who should pay the costs of the suit. The mortgage deed had been engrossed and executed by the plaintiff. lr. Wigram and Mr. Cairns appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Malins and M1r. Terrell for the defendant. The VICE-CHAq}CELLOR made a decree directing the defendant to execute the mortgage deed and to pay the costs of the suit, except those relating to the affidavit giving the required explanation. LEE V. OIDING. This was a bill praying a declaration that the plaintiff was entitled to a porion of a certain trust fund, and that the trustees of the fund might be directed to transfer the same into the plaintifd's mame. By the settlement made on the marriage of the plaintiff's father and mother, in 1807, certain funds were vested in trustees, in trust after the death of the surIvor of them for such one or more of the children as they or the survivor of them should appoint; and, in default of appointment, in trust for the sons attaining the age of 21 and the daughters attaining that age, or marrying, equally. There were twvo hchildren of the marriage-vizn, the plaintiff and a daughter. Upen the marriage of the daughter, wvho died in 1842, an ap, pointment wvas made in her favour of 5,000Ol. Three per tCent. R~edeemed Aununities, part of the trust fund, to take~ effect after the decease of the survivor of her father aind mother. The mother also died inl1842. In July, 1843, thv plaintiff vwas adjudged a banLrupt, and on the 10th of Bebruary, 1844, he obtained his certificate. On the 12th of the same month of February his father appointed the residue of the trnstfund,being 8,05llL ThreeperCent.ReducedAanujties and 9,060?: BanL-Stock, in favour of his son, to take effedi after his (the fatber's) decease. The father died in 3W 1855. The plaintiff's assignees in bank-ruptcy claimed so much of the trust fund as the plaintiff would have been entitled to in the event of no appointment having been xnadX in his favour byhis father. lMr. Wigramand MIr. Cairns were for the plaintifM.h Bacon and MEr. I.ewin for the assignees, and Mr. Fiield fot the trustees of the settlemnent. The VICE-CIIAyCELLOR said that dinring the beankruptcy and before the plaintiff obtained his certificate all the interest that the assignees had in the trust fund was a defeasihle interest. After The date of thne certificate, and by trhe ex;ercise of the power of appointment, the interest af the ..ssignees had been validly defeated, and he was not ahm liberty to withhold from the plaintiff the f und which Iliad been 'validly appointedv in h3is favou-r. There would therefore be a decree for the plaintiff. (Befom'c TVice-Chcancellor Sir W. P. WOOn.) RUSSELL V. 1i'CULLOCH.

The bankrapt, a grocer, of B3isbopsgate-street Withcut, applied for his certUficate a few days since, when judgment. was reserved. His HoNOUR now said the bankrapt was charged with. the highest offencesin the eye of the baulrupt law-namely, concealment of property and falsifying of his accounts. Under the 251st and 252d sections, which applied to such offences, the bankrapt vas liRahe in the tirst c-e ta an, indictment for felony, and in the other for misdemenour; andthe 2755th section said that if suspected or charged with such offences, the Court miglit direct the assignees to institte a prosecution, and order that t*e costs should. be paid out ofjthe estate, and, in the event of there being no estate, out of the account standing in the name of the Chief Registrar in the Bank of England.

SPdTVIG ASSIZES. -,*o-RTHER.N CIRCUIT. "FRE 13URN,02FMD MURDER. DURHAM, MUARCH ty. %ihie opening of the court this morning the prisoners, >*iard Bayne, 44, and John Cain, 40, who stand comMrifted fortrialonthe charge of murdering Mfr. Robert -tSrling, at Winlaton, in this county, on the Ist of NovemIber, 1855, were placed at the bar. Ur. Overend, the Hon. A. IAddell, and Mr. Blackwell nppeared for the prosecution; Mr. Digby Seymour and Mr. Davison on behalf of the prisoners. *fr. OVE;REi, addressing hisLordship, said,-In the case of- Richard Rayne and John Cain, I have to ask your Lordship to postpone the trial. There are certain articles it is necissary should be discovered, and up to this time they1 have not been discovered. They relate to a certain branch of the evidence; and only recently the poEce have received information relating to certain other artlicles which it is important should be investigated. Baron MAiTm.-Let me look at the affidavit. -3dr. ONEREND.-We think the affidavit ought not to be read aloud, and my learned friend who appears for the defence is of the same opinion. *His LoRDSHP looked at the affidavit, and then asked 3Mr. Seymour what he had to say against the applicaltion. ' Mr. SEsv 0oui observed that there had not been sufficient notice of the application; and, besides, it was some time since the information had been received by the police, so that they had had ample time to makethe investigation. 'Baron M&, RTIi.-There is no objection in point of time. Mfr. Overend was prepared to make the applcation yesterday. You do not wish the affidavit to be read, and that is quite proper, as it would be 'wrong to make public the information stated in it, which clearly affords a foundation for further inquiry. - Mr. SE oUR complained of the hardship that would be inflicted upon his clients, who were poor men, by the postponement of the trial. - Baron M T5.-Well, that cannot be helped. It may be n hardship. I make out from the depositions that a man has been murdered. I do not excpress any opinion against the prisoners; but this is a matter which, for the interest of the public, ought to be most thoroughly investigated, and the investigation can only be properly conducted 'by allowing time to make inquiry into all the circumstances. - After hearing Mr. DAVISON on the same point, His LOxDsIP ordered the trial to be postponed. A gplication was then made by Mr. OVEREXD for the costs of the prosecution up to this time, which His LOaDSaIP said he would allow if he had the power. The prisoners -were then remanded, and the Court proceeded with the trial of minor cases, in which it was engaged the remainder of the day. it is understood that the additional information received by- the nolice in the murder case relates to the lancets which are sai. to have belonged to the deceased, and which were talken from his person at the time of the murder. The bill against Iiayne and Cain was not sent before the grand jury.
Wl7RTRRN (TIR(TIMT Wl CIIESTEI MARCH 6. - (Before i r. Serjeant CAMMTELL.) Miehael Cuffe was indicted for attempting to drown his wife, Rebecca Cuffe, on the 20th of February, at Portsea. 3Mr. Coleiidge conducted the case for the prosecution. The "risonerwas a private in the 29d Foot, and wasmarned toeis wife in Dublin in 1854. He left Ireland in the course of last year, and joined his regiment at Portsmouth; his wife came to Portsmouth last month. On the l9th of February the prisoner and his wife, with a woman named Caseidy-, with whom he was on intimate terms, went to the Blue Bell Inn, St. Mary's-street, where they remained driking until the house was closed, at 12 o'clock. They then aU rwent to the King's-mill, near the publichouse. After valking about a short time, Cassidy left them, and the prisoner, after telling his wife that she was too dirty to go. to the barracks and that she must get some clean clothes, said, "Let me see if I am as stronz as: I used to be." He then lifted her on to the radl of the bridge upon which they were standing, and told her to remain on it while he looked at her. He then took her by the feet and threw her over into tue water. She called out for help, but the prisoner ran away. bhe caught Iold of something, and was soon afterwards taken out by .three men. It appeared that the prisoner had been quarrelling with his wife in the course of the evening at the Blue Bell about the woman Cassidy, and they continued quarrelling after they left the publichouse. The prisoner bad taken Cassidyto the barracks before the arrival of his wvife from )uilin, and passed her off as his w!ife. The prisoner was -apprehended on this charge onthe same evening, but he said he knew nothing of it. He was takento the police station, where his wife w,as. The woman Cassidy was put into the box by the prosecution, but not asked any questions. The prisoner examined .her, and she swore that the prisonervwas in bed with her at .the time this transaction was said to have taken place. She swore positively that ahe had never been at the Blue Bell publichouse in her life. Witnesses were then called who swore that Cassidy was at the Blue Bell that night with the prisoner and his wife. The learned SERJMILNT having summed up. The jury returned a verdict of Guilty, and he was sen*-t fA lfi Years' transportation. Thomas Jones was imdicted f6rthev-Wua muraer tE Charles Willam Hope, on board the Stirling Castle convict hulk at Portsmouth. Mr. Coleridge prosecuted; and Mllr. Saunders, at the request of thpiwJu-- a * s-- 1a6n(RGE, in stating the case to the jury, said,-In this case it had not pleased God, as in the last, that the attempt upon life should be unsuccessful. He did not know that inhis experiencehehadeverhappenedto deal withacase more painful and more calculated to arouse the deepest feelings of our nature; but it happily, ashe considered, was not the duty of counsel fortheprosecution to attempt to heighten the effects of the facts with which lie had to deal; his duty was most simple-to state the facts as clearly and bliefly as he could, and leave the jlury to draw such inferences as they conscientiously thought just. The prisoner at the bar was a convict on board the Stirling Castle, which was an inlvalid ship in Portsmouth harbour. The'unfortunate gentleman who was hilled, Mr. Hope, was the surgeon in charge of the health of the convicts on beard that ship. It appeared that the prisaer had been, for some disease he had upon him, under medical treatment by Lr. Hope, that he had got better of the disease with which he had been attaclked, and Mr. Hope had removed him from the lower deck to a place in the ship called the " class," the differenice being that in the lower deck the convicts had beds and were exempted from worl;, while in the " class' they slept in hammocks, and were compelled to do certain portions of work. The prisoner resented this alteration, and more than once requested Mr. Hope to place him on the lower deck, but Mr. Hfope declined to do so. On the 8th of Febtuary the prisoner c.me to the surgery where Mr. Hope was engaged, and asked Mr. Hop to examine hinm with a view to his being replacedonthe lowerdeck. br. Hope examined him, and then told him that he saw no reason for placing him below. 'The prisoner said Mr. Hope was biassed by Mr. Williams. Mr. Hope told him he was quite mistaken, and it did not appear that he anticipated any violence, as he quietly left an sugery. Therisor followved him. Hope went -3ntoagallery w3iich ran round the chael of the ship, and in that gaerythe prisoner seized -. Hope with the left hand, and vwith the right hand struck Ein one single blow on the neck, having something in his; hand. That blow; was the death blowv to Mr. Hope;* it cut through his neckeloth, through a shawl wrapper, and into the jugular vein. Mr. Hope went some littlc distance into a room of the ship. He sat down upon a chair, but fell from it, and in five minutes from the time of receiving the blow he ceased to live. There had been no provocation -no quarrel; the blow was struck in perfectly cold blood. So far as he (the learned counsel) could see, except the great mystery of motive, there was no mystery in the case ; and so far from the prisoner having shown any regret or remorse or sorrow for wvhat he had done, he said the only thing he regrettedwas that instead of having had M. Hope only he had not had the whole of the medical staff of the ship, and he told Mr. Wiliams; the chief warder, that he wished he could get at him, he should have something, and that he might take his word for it there was some one in the ship waiting for him; and he told another gentleman who came there that it would not have happened but for the favouritism shown to the prisonore on thl lower deck-. He also said that he did not regret what he had done, and that if ho had 20 lives he was ready to give them TIPS He again and again avowedthat he had done it, and he gloried in what he had done; he had determinedif Mr. Hope did not comply with his request to remove himto the lower deck to put an end to his life. He said he had obtained one of ihe common knives of the ship, and before he used it he hia taken care deliberately to sharpen it, but the prisoner had been placed in a cell in which there was a convenience which communicated with the water, and the knife, therefore, had not been found: He (the learned counsel) believed he need sayno more. He wished it were possible to relieve them from hearing and himself from inquiring into the melancholy details it would be his duty to lay before them. It would make all feel shame and humiliation to think what human nature was capable of, but theywould also feel gratitude and thankfulness when they reflected that crimes such as these led to an investigation, when, if a prisoner were innocant, the jury would at once acquit him, but, if they believed him to be guilty, they would firmly vindicate the majesty of those divine and human laws which he had so wantonly outraged. Several witnesses werc called, who completely proved the case as stated by the learned counsel. M1r. SiuXNDERs addressed the jury for the prisoner, urging upon them that at the moment of tho act the prsoner was acting under a delusion that he had been ill. treated by some persons, and that his mind was in such a state that he was impelled irresistibly to commit this act, and therefore was not resp;onsible for his conduct. Hethen alludedto the cases of bPNaughten, Oxford, and Westron, and submitted that under the circumstances the prisoner was not at the time a moral agent. The learned SxEnEAT then sunmmed up. It was of the utmost importance that when the crime of murder was cormmitted the person committing it shonld be brought to justice. There was nothing in point of law to reduce the offence below the crime of murder, but the questionwas whether for that murder the prisoner was responsible. No medical man had been called to explain to them the state, of the prisoner's mind, and the only argument of the counsel to show that the prisoner was not responsible waso from the act itself, and from the expressions of the prisener. The counsel for the prisoner had caued upon them to assme that the prisoner"ws labouring under a delusio5n, - hut, even if they thought he was acting under a delusion,.: he was responsible for t aa iff he was ciapable of distiniuishing between right andi wrong. If they were'o opinion that there was no delusion, then that defence faiMd, bat if Ihey toughthe was ac.ting under some delusion, but stillthatJme was capable of d nsti gbtieen right and wroag,t woul be thir dut to f bi4 im guiilty. GulThey. *lmosS imrnediately returned a verdict_ of Theleasned Juix;, then putting on the black cap, passed the sentence of death upon the prioner.
OXFORD CIRCUIT. OXFORD. MIAitw 6. The commission for the county of Oxford was opened yestsrday in the usnal form. This morning Mr. Justice Cresswell and Mr. Baron Bramwell attended Divine service at St. Mary's, and at 12 o'clock took their seats in court; Mr. Justice Cresswellpresidinginthe Criminal Court, and Mr. Baron 33ramwvell in t'he Civil Court. The cause list contains an entry of six causes, three of whicharemarkedforspecial juries, and one is an undefended action on a bill of exchange. The calendar is very light, and contains a list of only 23 prisoners. One is charged with stealing a post letter and its contents, another with horsestealing, a third. with shooting, and a fourth-a clergyman named the Rev. Richard 3eux Benson-is charged with feloniously solemnizing matrimony between Richard Pinnel7 Carey and Sarah Carey without publication of banns, licence, or superintendent registrar's certificpte. The parties in this case, it is understood, had been previously married under the Dissenters Marriage Act, and had been remarried by the Rev. Mr. Benson, who has. thus exposed himself to a charge of felony. A ccrtiorari has been -ranted to remove the indictment, which has been round, so that the trial will not take place at the present assizes, but either in the Court of Queen's Bench or on the civil side of the court at the next assizes. CIL COURT.-(Before Mr. Baron D Bs.,%iIwLL.) Mfr. Baron BRn rWvELL this day tried two cases, wlhich were entirely devoid of interest; and in the latter part of the day, some of the leading counsel being engaged in the Criminal Court, his Lordship tried several prisoners. CRn1nLSAL CoURT.-(Beforc Mr. Justice CRESSWELL.) Benjamin Prior, aged 21, post-office clerk, was charged with stealing a post letter, containing a sovereign, two halfsovereigns, a shilling postage stamp, and a card, the property of the 3?ostmaster-General, at Woodatock, on the 20th of Mr.eVhateley, Q.C., and Mr. Bros appeared for the prosecution; Mr. tieriennt Pi'ott defeended the prisoner. In this case it appeared that, in consequence of complaints made to the Post-office authorities, Mr. Moule, assistant inspector-general, was on the 19th of September last sent downvto uxford to make inquiries. The inspector there made np a letter to be forwarded to Woodstock, and placed in an envelope a sovereign, two half-sovereigns, a Is. postage stamp, and a card of a Mrs. Jordan, of Birmingham. The letter was directed to "MErs. Carter, Banbury-road, Middleton Cheney, near Banbury." Havin" given infornation to the postmaster at Banbury that such a letter would be forwarded, the inspecor, at 7 'clock in the evening of the 19th, gave the letter to Mr. Brunner, the head clerk of the post-office at Oxford, who posted it and stamped it, and, according to the usual course, forwarded it with other letters to WYoodstock in a bag, to be there re-sorted for Banbury. On the morning of the 20th information arrived at O-xford that the letter in question had not arrived in Banbury.. The inspector and chief clerk, in consequence, immnediately went over to Woodstock, and, having procured the assistance of a constable, they, at about 9 o'clock, went to the post-office, where the urisoner resided. he beina a clerk in thi P.fflee n -- his father. The prisoner was in bed at the time, but after a short delay the doorwas opened. The inspector told the prisoner who he was, and ascertained from him that he had been on duty alone that night from half-past 11 o'clock till 4 o'clock in the morning. The prisoner was asked for his money, and said it was in a drawer but, on being asked for the key, he at first said it was in tie neext room, then that it was downstairs, and, lastly, that he did not know where it was, but that he would break open the drawer. The drawer was accordingly broken open, and some gold was found in a purse, but not any of the missing coin. The parties then went downstairs, but in a short time returned to the bedroom to make a further search. On removing the bedclothes some gold and other articles were seen through the cords of the tick lying on the floor. The Prisoner immediately claimed the articles so found, whiclh consisted of a sovereign, two half-sovereigns, some silver, a knife, and hvo keys, as his property. The gold was identified as the same which had been put into the missing letter, and one of the keys fitted the drawer which had been broken open. - The envelope itself was not found, nor the card or stamp which had been enclosed in it. It appeared that several points in the evidence which the inspector gave this day were not set down in his deposition, but the witness said he had mentioned them, and he attributed their omission to a leaning shown by the Woodstock magistrates in favour of the prisoner. He also denied a suggestion made to him that he had advised the prisoner's friends to get the bail fixed at a low amount, and to send the prisoner away to America. Mr. Serjeant PrOorT, for the prisoner, contended that the identity of the money had not been sufficiently proved, and called several witnesses, who gave the prisoner a good character. Mr. Justice CRESwELL having summed up the evidence, The jury, without the least hesitation, found the prisoner Guilty. Sentence deferred.
=IDLAND CIRCUIT. LEICESTER. f ci3Icu 5. (CIVm SDE.-(Before the CrEr BARON and a Special Jury.) aEinE VETwnn V. PRICrE ANI) OTInIs. This was an action brought to recover compensation for injury done to the plaintiff's land by the working of a colliery, and also for the exercise of a privilege caUed " wayleave," which consists in the liberty of bringing up through a&pit on the plaintiffs land coal lying under adjacent land, L'r -'.;fferent title. MIr. Serjeant Htreg nd-;arr. Rittleston were counsel for plaintiff; Mr. Mellor, Q.C., and Mr. Field for the defendants.- ' The plaintiff is the rector of Cole Orton andvicar of Whitwick-, m this county, to which vicarage he was instituted abbut 35 years ago; and the land respecting which the present action vas brought was part of the glebe of the vicarage of Whitwick, which had been allotted in lieu of the small tithes under an enclosure act, passed in the year 1803. By that act it was provided that Lord 3loirna and Colonel Boultbee, who were the owners of the coals and other minerals under the enclosed lands, should continue to hold and enjoy the same as before the enclosure; and power was given to them to enter upon any of the allotments, to dig and search for coal and other minerals, to sink shafts, erect engines, make roads, and deposit the coal, stones, spoil and rubbish upon the land, they making' a full and ample compensation from time to time to the owner or owners, occupier or occupiers of the lands for any damage done thereto by the working of the said mines. About the year 1830, three persons, named Price, Cowlishaw, and Bostock, took a lease from Colonel Boultbee of the mines under the land in queston, and under other land allotted under the same enclosure act; and in 1837 they took of the plaintiff at a rent of 41. a-year a small piece of laud adjoining a pit which they had just opened. U to that time the glebe was good agricultural land, partly grass, and partly arable; but, by the agreement then made the lessees of the mnes, who then began to work what was caUed the Pe'sgreen Colliery, undertook to cultivate the land in a husbandlike manner, except such part as should be usedi for the purposes of the colliery, and as to the part so used the damage was to be accounted foratthe expiration of the tenancy. From that time to the present the colliery company had continued theirmiig op,erations, taking from timae to time more and more of the vicar's Land, until they had got above two acres, which. had been rendered useless for all ordinary agricultural pu r- poses by the sinking of pits, the deposit of spoil banks the erection of engines, and the rnakingof roads thereon. In February, 1851, a formal claim for compensationwas made on the part of the plaintiff; and the solicitors of the company answered that they were making compensation to the tenants for the temporary damage, and that none of apermanent kind had been done. At Lady-day, 1852, the agreemont of 1837 was determined by the plaintiff by a notice to ouit, and at that time it appeared that there had been a change in the persons who were carrying on the colliery. In 1845 one of the original lessees had died, and his interest had passed to his children; and at subsequent dates the same thing had happened with respect to the other original lessees, so that the 10 defendants in the present action, who were children and representatives of the three original lessees, had not themselves commenced the working of the colliery, but had only continued the working which the original lessees had commenced. For the injury done to the glebe land by these operations the plaintiff claimed a sum of 3171., which was the amounn atb which his surveyors had estimated it. They were of opinion that the land had been rendered wholly useless for any other purpose, and that it woald cost. more to restore the Land to its original state than the vaine of the fee simple. The defendants contended that they were only liable for what had been done since 1845, and that since that sear only one acre and one perch had been taken, the value of which their witnesses estimated at between 501. and 601. The other claim of the plaintiff in respect of a way leave was quite distinct from the first. Intheyear 1853 the plaintiff discovered that the defendants had, for two or threevears, been getting coal fromland in the adJoining parish of Worthington, and bringing up that coal by a pit on the glebe land ; and as this was not authorized by the act of Parliament, he claimed a compensation for the use of that privilege; and several witnesses of experience as mineral agents estimated the value of that privilege in this case, at from 401. to 501. per acre; and the quantity of coal obtained from Worthington was proved to have been about 2A acres. The rent paid at different collieries for this privilege was said to vary from a peppercorn to 1001. an acre. In answer to this claim the defendants contended that the plaintiff had sustained no damage, because an arrangement had been made by them with an adjoining colliery, wher~eby a larger quantity of the Pegg's-green coal bad boeen sent up a shaftin the bund of another owvner; and their witnesses stated that at all even.ts the privilege was not w orth more than 51 per acre. The Cnrnr BARON, in summing up, told the jury that the question of amount was entirely for them; balt as to the principle of assessment, there was no doubt that the plaintiff as incumbent of th'e vicarage was entitled to be compensated to the same e.xtent as any ordinary owner in fee, and he thought that, under the circumstances, the jury might properly take into aceount all the damage which had -been done since 1837.

P-OLICE. GuiLDTmAT.-Henry lambert, a clerk in the employ of Mr. GreenfLeld, a stocljdbber, of Throgmorton-street, was harged with defrauding his master to a large amount. The prisoner is a young man of about 18 years of age, andvery dissipated appearance, and attended this court on Saturday last to prosecute a woman of notorious character for robbing hzim of his purse, contining about 41. On that occasion the wYoman was committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court, and the prisoner, who then swore his name was Henry Dobson, was bound over to prosecute. After evidence had been given in support of the charge, Alderman CsALLis said there appeared to be onlv two cases out a number of very serious frauds, and ho shoulittherefore remand the prisoner for a week, in order that the case might be completed for trial, for it was evident that the prisoner had been carrying on this pract;ce to a considerable extent. Bow-STREET.-A man of about 50 years of age, named 'WiDliam Thomson, was brought up on remand, charged with uttering two forged notes. Hle wasgiven in custody on Wednesday of last week, by Mr. Hunt, manager of Messrs. 3Moses and Son's branch establishment, in Hart-street, Bloomsbury, for tendering, in payment foi some clothes he had purchased, a document purporting to be a Bank of England 51.-note, which on examination was found to be a forgery. When brought to this court he stated that he was a brickinaker in a good business at Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, and offered references to his neighLours, and to persons by whom he had been employed for years before conunencing business. He said he had received the note from a little boy, his nepheiv, who had picked it up in the street at Bedford. He was remanded for further inquiry, and it was then ascertained that his account of his occupation and antecedents was strictly correct, and that he bore an excellent character. But, on the other hand, a shopman in the establishment of Mr. Frew, tailor, High Holborn, attended to prove that, two days before his apprehension, the prisoner had passed at that establishment what was supposed to bo a Bank of England note for 51., and was only found to be a forgery the following day. The prisoner's friends had secured the attendance of his little nephew, who stated that on Sunday week he found a 51.-note- in Potter-street, Bedford, and took it home to bis uncle. On his saying that he found one such " piece of pa er,' the prisoner interrupted him by exclaiming "bot of them " but the boy, who appeared not to understand him, went on in the singular to the end of the story. The prisoner was committed on both charges. A great pcortion of the time of the Court was again takeni up wvith charges against reputed thieves and suspected persons-mostly ooys-for picking pockets in the crowds assembled in the streets imimediately adjoining the ruins of Covent-garden Theatre; and William Wiliamson and William Robertson, two young men, were fined each 11. for being drunk and disorderly on the previous evening, in Bow-street, nearly opnosite what was the grand entP. n,' A gentleman from the office of Mr. Reeves, the Government Surveyor, applied, on the part of the Commissioners of Police, for an order to take down certain portions of the wals of Covent-garden Theatre, which were in a dangerous condition. It was proposed to lower the northern wall abutting on Hart-street, and the southern waU (which appeared to threaten the police-court), and entirely to remove them, if irecessary. The required order was at once granted. WORSIIIP-STREET.-Mary Anne Hoins, Jane Thomp. son, and Maary Anne ld'Donald, three showily-dressed young women, were charged before Mr. HA-saiuL with the followIng robbery:- ayter, oneof the officers attached to the Bishopsgate terminus of the Eastern Counties Railway, stated that on the arrival of the train from Colchester between 12 and 1 o'clock that day, his attention was particularly attracted to the conduct of the prisoners, who were loitering about the platform as though waiting for friends, but every now and then pressed in such an evidently intentional manner against some of the lady passengers as to leave very little doubt as to their object. This course they pursued for some timc, when Hopkins quietly walked up to a lady who was engaged in sorting out her luggage at the barrier, took something out of the pocket in the side of her dress, passed it on to Thompson, who stood next to her, and Thompson as rapidly transferred it to a well-dressed man who was stauding alone behind both, and manifestly screening their operations. The four then moved away, and the witness hastened np to the lady and asked her if she had lost anything, as he suspected she had been robbed. The lady felt in her pocket, and at once said her purse had been stolen, on which he cealled to another constable and secured the three women, but their male confederate had contrived to get out unobserved. The women were taken to the stationhouse and searched, when, in addition to a quantity of loose money being found upon each, twvo photographic portraits were discovered upon one of them, and one of these portraits bore so strikring a resemblance to the man he had seen with them as to leave no doubt as to its being his likeness; he had scarcely obtained possession of it, however, than the woman snatched it out of fis hand, and dashed it to the ground with such force as to shatter it into fragments. Alderman, the gaoler, accounted for the frequent possession of these photographic portraits by pickpockets and other thieves by stating that a great number of the swell mob and their confederatas ha.d now systematized their plans of operations that they were in the constant habit of providing themselves with these portraits of their accom. plices to prevent mistake, so that when a robbery had been effected they might nnfailingly transfer the stolen property *to-the confederate "working' with them, however disguised he or she might be. Miss Eliza Dempsey, a lady residing at Brentwood, and the prosecutrixLin the case, deposed to being a first-class assenger by the train in question, but declared the robbery had been so cleverly effected that she had not the slightest idea her purse had been stolen until she was accosted by the officer and asked to examine her pockets. Carter, in answer to a question of the magistrate as to 'whether any of the prisoners were recognized, said that he had known the prisoner Thompson for the last two years - she was the constant associate of well-dressed thieves. and he had little doubt, if an opportunity were offered hin, that he should be able to substantiate other charges also against her. Neither prisoner offered any defenc, and they were all therefore remanded till that day week. SOUTHWArRK.-A powerful-looking young fellow named Tllomas Connor was charged with the following robbery of watches and chains 21r. Nicholas Straub said he was a watchmaker and jeweller, at No. 77, Blackmaan-street, Southwark, and carried on business with his brother. Between 9 and 10 o'clock on the previous nighLt he was sitting in his parlour at the rear of the shop, when he was alarmed by hearing a loud crash of broken glass in the shop. He immediately rushed in there, and sawv the prisoner's hands inside thc i-wndow which was broken, grasping at all the gold chains and gold watches within his reach. -He had at least 20 gold watches, worth 150Z. and 20 gold chains worth 1001., which he pulled out from. the window. Witness instantly ran out of the shop, and caught hold of the prisoner as-he was runnirng away with the property.- He dropped some of the watches and chains on the paveaient, and others he threw into the road. A tradesman came up to his assistance, and they secured the prisoner until a constable camne up, when he gave him into custody. Ail the property was picked up and restored to him, except four gold watches, worth 401, which had not been found. The damage done to the watches pickdd-up was considerable. The prisoner said that- he belonged to Hull, and, being out of work since Christmas, he came up to London -to seek something to do. He wvas disappointed, an rendered7desperate from starvatiou. Hedidbreak the window and steal the property, and he would do so again if he was starvng Mr. A'BECIU,r told him, from the daring manner* in which he had committed the robbery, he iuspected that this was not his first offence. He should therefore commit him for trial at the next assizes - and ho hoped the police would in the meantime make particular inoniries abhiit. im ..
FAT F .--A few weeks ago a gentleman,' since known as' Captain Maxwell, came to reside in Mlvern, and took up his residence at the Abbey Hotel, where he remained for a few days, and then removed to Ash-grove. Nothing further was known of him than that he was a man of eccentric and somewhat intemn. perate habits, frequenting various publichouses in the town, and lavishly treatig any persons whom he happened to meet. On Saturday night last, about' 10 o'clock, he left the Fermor Arms Inn, quite sober, having partaken of only two glasses of brandy, and, it was supposed, went towards lhome; but on Sunday morning, about a quarter past 7, hisdead body was discovered at the foot of the Ivy Rock, by a little girl named Mary Ann Morgan, who was crossing the North HIL Death had evidently been caused by his falling from the summit of the rock, a height of about 60 feet. There is no pathway leading to the summit of the Ivy Rock. and the spot where the deceased's bodcy was found is in a direction quite contrary to that leading to his residence. Upon searching his clothes only two pawn tickets were found upon himp'-one dated the 3d of January, for a gold guard,: pledged in London, and the other dated the Ist of March, for a gold watch, pledged for 51. The whole of his money is missing, as also two massrve rings he was known to wear. Portions of his coat were found adhering to the rock, clearly tracing his descent. On a g7ot mne emination of the body it was found that nine ribs of the right side were completely smashed, and the flesh stripped from the upper part of the rightar.--TorcesteCroride.

'The following ouitline of the proceedings of the coroner's inquest held on the body of this ill-fated gentleman is supplied by the correspondent of the veiziig EMail "Yesterday (Monday, the 3d of March) Mr. Ecdmond }L Lyncb,coroner, held an inquest on the body of deceased. The jury found a verdict of '' Wilful murder against'some person or persons unknown.' The main facts in the evidence were, that deceased came to the country from Dublin on Friday, the 29th of February ; drove with two of his tenants to a seneseha's office near Loughrea, to replevin some cattle of his which were seized and impounded under a decree; that he got hack to the parishi pound about 11 o'clock p.m., took out of the pound one cow, which he and one of his tenants drove towards wherehe lived, aplace called Ballinamona; that he met the herd near his residence, who took charge of the cow, and accompanied his master to within ten yards of his master's house, when they separted, and his master bade him good ni&ht. Deceased went home, caUed up his steward and housekeeper; the latter he told to leave this house imstanter, adding tlhat it was her family sued him and impounded his cattle, andthat he would turn her and them off the land; it was then half-past 12 o'clock on Saturday morning, 1st of March. The housekeeper caught her -clothes up and went out. Deceased went out also, and told his steward to boil the kettle in his absence, and that he would go for some milk for tea; deceased and the woman left the house together, he scolding her until they came to the house of one ichael Quigley, a tenant to MIr. Callaghan. This house was little over 200 yardls from deceased's. Here Mr. Callaghan stopped to get milk for his tea; the woman 'turned and stooped under the hedge until ir. Callaghan lNed called for the milk and bold the woman of the house to lrin-it tohim. Mr. Callag7an then left to return home, when t7us woman, whom he had just discharged, emerged from the hedge and went into the house. Mr. Calaghan did not go more than 15 or 20 yards from Quigley's house on his way back, when he was struck in the forehead, apparently mnocked flat back, his forehead beaten completely in, the frontal bone separated fxom the skull, the ejes driven out, and the whole skull sihattcred to pieces. The woman of the house had just been up and was opening the door as the housekeeper was enteerug. They spoke a few words, the latter tellingthe former she was discharged, &c. Now, it would seem that when they were thus speaking was the time Mr. Callaghan was being murdered, within 15 or 20 yards of where they stood,-yet both women swvear they heard no noise or sound whatever. The steward, thinking his master a long time away, took a lantern aud went in search of hinL The night was darkc, and he discovered him en the pathway by observing his dog lapping up what, on looking at, he found to be his master's blood.

A numerous and highly respectable meeting of the Associated GeneralMedical Practitioners and Licentiate Apothecaries took place last evening at their hall, in Mary-street.

A petition founded on this resolution is to be drawn up, and placed for presentation in the hands of MAr. Whiteside, its prayer to be supported by the University and city members. It is believed that the learned bodies here-namely, the Colleges 6f Physicians and Surgeons-are also strenuously opposed to the measure. SLIGO BOROUGH BELECTON. Letters from Sligo announce the formalwithdrawal of all the candidates from the hustings save Mr. WVynne and MIr. Somers, in whom are respectively personified the Derbyite and. Palinerston Adminisihation. Great efforts, it is reported, were made to induce Mr. Somers to give way to some other Liberal more to the taste of the constituency, but the exnmember was inexorable, and the contest (says the Erieenan) " will be one between Palmerston's nominee and. the nominee of the Carlton Club." The odds are altogether in favour of Mr. Wynne. The Roman Catholic cleigy keep aloof, and many of the laity of the same persuasion wvill probably vote for the kind Orange landlord. in preference to their old representative. 1 TIPPERARY* B AXI. The docket was lodge(l in this case on Tuesday, and the proceedings under thae Winding-up Acts are to take place in the offioe of Master 2Iurphy. The effects of the crash will be soon made apparent, and every day the belief grows stronger that the whole weight of the responsibilities will devolve uipon some half-dozen or more wealthy individuals who had the misfortune to be shareholders in the doomed concern. But a few days since Mr. James Sadleir was an object of general sympathy, as people charitably supposed that he was the victim of, rather than accessory to, his brother's frauds. The revelations in the Rolls' Court on Tuesday have, however, completely tuned the tide of popular feeling; and for years to come Sadleirs' Baak -will beoaly -remembered as one of the plague spots in the Irish social system.

EARTERM (MTTq~nvc..( The adjourned, meeting of this company was held pro forind at the London Tavern yesterday, and immedliately afterwards adjourned to Saturday, the 8th inst., at 12 'clock, to receive the report of the screutineers on the result of the poll for the electionl of threedirectora Itis believed that the result will be in favour of Mr. Waddington, Mr. Packe, and Mr. Goodson. EAST ANGIaAN. The report of the directors of this company states that the expenditure on capital account during the half-year amounted to 2,5121., including 2,1601. for bonds discharged and cancelled. The traffic showed a gradual increase for the last half-year ending the 31st of December; it amountedto 23,6791.; for the corresponding period of 1S54 to 22,5B01.; and for the same reriod of 1853 to 24,964Z., showing an increase of 2,71BI. on the ha3f-year endingthe 31st ofDecember, 1853, and of 1,129. on that of 1854. The working expenses chargeable this half-year amounted to 461.12s. 6d. per . cent. The result was that they were able to pay interest for the haf-year on the B stock after the f rate of 6 per cent., and on the C stock after the rate of 21. 1&. 4d. per cent. per annum. The directors regret to observe that their exertions to obtain from the Eastern Counties Company, the rights which were gnaranteed to the East nglian under the agreement -with that company have been made the ground for misapprehension, and that the demand made for equal moileage rates has been represented as an act of hostility towards adjoining lin3es. They trust, however, that -when thc purposes. for -which those inisrenresentationfs were made have been answered, the just and legal rights of the company will be considered, and carried into effect in a epiritof fairness consistent with the agreement. The capital account to the 31st of December showed that 1,640,9961. had been received, and 1,637,9481. e-xpended, leaving a balance of 3,0481. The revenue account for the half-year showed that 24,2971. had been received, and 1,04. expended, leaving a balance of GLASGOW AND SOU1THi-WESTERN. 'The half-yearly meeting of this company was held in Glasgow on Wednesday; Mr. Andrew Orr (the Lord Provost of Glasgow), the chairman, in;the chair. - The report, an abstract of which appeared in 27cc Tines of Tuesday, was`held`as'read. ' ' The C ThMIT,-in moving the approval of the report, said, he hoped the shareholders felt, as the directors did, very much satisfied with-the afairs and present appearance 'ofthe company... Since the Last'half-year the business had gone on in a. seady and p?rogressive manner, and from the weekly receipts they -would observe that the general business, both in Piassen era and goods, continued regularly to increase. This hadled to considerable expcnse in tho purchase of waggons and other plant, therehygiving additional facilities for the carrying of minerals On the other hand, the relative expenses, as compared with the increase in goods and passengers, was much dimiinished. The directors were desirous to follow out the principle that the revenue snould keep the line and plant in the most efficient manner, and from the present state of affairs their funds would- meet every exigency of the company. Doring the last half-year the interest of money had inreased upon them, but it was not more than might be expected from the state of the money-yaarket. They were all exceedingly pleased that the warfare between two neighbouring companies-the Caledonian and the Edinburgh and Glasgowhad been put an end to. For the last 18 months this contest had disturbed the railway business in that part of the country, particularly in passengers, and it had had no doubt a prejudicial effect upon railway property throughout Scot. land. The folly of two great companies playmg the game of " beggar my neighbour " had been shown there in it perfect absurdity. The neit question ras the ratc of the dividend they should pay, which had beer the subject of serious discussion vith the directors. The3 came to the conclusion that 4 per cent. was a just and wis( sum to recommend. The balance of 6,8211. which was lef over seemed a large one;' but, looking to the additiona' interest payable on the sum borrowed for the Dalmelling ton line, the cost of extended workshops, and other matters induced the directors to lay that sum aside. The companj had been regularly increasing in prosperity, and if the, could show that the present rate of dividend was not onlv positive certainty, but that it would gradually increase, thi would render the whole property more valuable than higher rate of dividend would do with a chance of flucta tion. The Dalmellington and Maybole railways would bi opened in a few 'weeks, and they would soon, there fore, bring a large traffic upon the main line. Thi minerals in that district were more abundant than has ever been anticipated, and much of them would b4 cariTed alongthe whole length of the line, and therebi increase the traffic. There was also a good prospect of itn Girvan and Castle Douglas branches passing this session o Parliament, and when completed they -would largel] increase the traffic of the company. A SHAREHOLDER stated that, from the accounts, it wa quite evidentthatthe company hadfundsto pay 4Jper cent.. which he recommended accordingly. After some discussion, it was resolved that the compan3 should declare adividend of- per cent. upon the guarantee andpreference stock, and of4per cent. upontheconsoli dated stock, to be paid oLathe 24th inst. After the election of diectors, the meeting separated. NORTH BRITISH. The report of the directors of this company states that the receipts for the half-year endingthe 31st of January last amounted to 136,5101, and for the conresponding period last year to 127,9127., showing an increase of 8,o581. The free revenue for the half-year, after payment of interest, is 25,1021. This wil liquidate the sum of 4,6301., forestalled on account of the deficiency to meet preference dividend at the 31st of July last, and, after paying the preference dividendi now due (19,.595.) in fall, will leave a balance of Q671. With re,gardto the extra outlay on working stock-, the directors state that, with the exception of one engine and tender sent out for repair at the end of 1854, the whole cosS of the renovation of rolling stock is wound up in the balance-sheet now presented. They state that the contrast between the past and the present state of the railway is the best justification of the remedies adopted. Eighteen months ago, of 71 engines, 3.3 were wholly disabled, and 16 only infair working condition; now, out of 72 engines, 53 are in good working order, and 10 onlyundergoing heavy repairs. At the former period punctuality of trains was the exception, nowit is the rule; then the goods engines were incapale of keeping time or drawing the traffic, now the goods trains are nearly as reml:r .X5 tl ce~n,,p, thnn ,lMA nn f4-- niow accidents are -of rare occurrenee, enalyv,iil the year ending 31st January, 1'55, the revenue was 2430,31., and for the year ending 31st January last it was 25S,Q001. The whole expense of rebtoring efficiency to the railway has been borne by revenue, including the loss of 1,7751. by depreciation of three old engines sold. Capi-al has only been charged with the cost of additional stock or value inparted to old stock, rebuilt and improved, and of new works required for the traffic, the safety of the public, or economy in working. The directors recommend the shareholders to suppoit them in their application to Parliament for raising furthier capital to pay off the liabilities of the company and to provide accommodation for the increasing traffic. They state that if capital were in a condition to repay the advance made to it from revenue, a dividend at the rate of 1 per cent. per annum nmight be paid to the ordinary shareholders noiw on the register. A provisional agreement has been entered into for working the SeLkirk and Galashiels Eailway 61 miles in length upon terms mutually advautageous to both companies. The capital account showved that 4,470,9981. had been' received, and 4,509,8851. expended, leaving a balance against the company of 38,8S61. The revenue account sbowved that 136,5101. had been received during the half-year, and 86,0621. expended in worldng exenses, and 2o,M461. interest on loans, leaving a balance of CORK A2ND YOUGHAIL The half-yearly meeting of this company -was held at Cork on Friday; MIr. I. Butt, 3LP., in the chair. The report stated that, with the exception of the portion immediately adjoining the city of Cork, the entire line w ould be completed at an expense of abouit 5,0001. per mile. Considering that the line will pass through a rich agricultural district, and comlmand the traffic betwveen Queenstown and Cork, it is fully expected that it will yield an ample return for the capital invested. Under existig circumstances the directors have thoughtit more prudent to defer the construction of the branch to Queenstewn, andto devote all their energies to the completion of the first portion of the main line, terminating at Mlidleton, -which they expect will be opened for traffic before the next half-yearly meeting. The directors have recently made a call of 30s. per share, which they hope will be speedily paid. The accounts showed hhat 26,837. bad been received to the 1st of Januaryeast, and 24,570l. expended, leaving a balance of 2,0671. The report of Mr. Brnel, the engineer, stated that of TA miles upon which the contractor is at work five miles .ie ready for ballasting. The work already executedhas shown that the lie can be completed within the cost contemuplated, and there would seem to be no reason for any change of views as to the advantages to be derived from an early opening of such portions as can he successfully completed. After some discussion as to the expediency of removing the boaxd from London to Cork, the report wasunanimously adopted, and the retiring directors were re-elected. The meeting was then made special, and the directors were authorized to accept the surrender of certain shares, and to issue new shares in lien thereof. A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceed'ings. eei RAILWAY BILLS INT p]APJA,tEl'N.

I 7rEETI2G OF MIDD.LESEX MAGZSTSPATES. A general meeting of the Middlesea magistrates was held! yesterday atClerkenwell Mr. Poveaall in the chair. The report of the Committee for Accounts and GeneraT Purposes was presented. The only feature it contained wort1L mentioning was in relation to the disallowance bv the comn mittee of an unusually large number of the fees charged by coroners for inqnests which the committee considered. to have been unnecessarily holden, and the total cha-ge for inquests since the 1st of January, to the date of the report; after the deductionsiluded to, amounted in the aggregate to 1,0471. 14s. After a discussion as to the rebuilding of Crooked Billetbiidge the report was adorted. fhe reports from the visiting justices of the prisons were. Drought up. It appeared that on the 29th of J anuary there were 1,362 prisoners in Coldbath-fields House of Correction, but since there had been a great increase, the number at the date of the report being 1,450. In the WestminsterPrison there were 897, and with the sanction of the Secretary of State the Committee had adopted -what had been in. operation for sometime at Coldbath-fields, and knomwn asthe "star system," by wlich prisoners-i-eceived on discharge 2s. Gd. for each "star," or good conduct mark they had.. received durmg imprisomment. In the Eouse of Detention, at tne date of the -report, there were 264 prisoners of all classes. The sanitary condition of each esta'blishment was. good. The consideration of the printed reports from the asylums; was deferred until a future day, when the proposed enlargements for the accommodation of an increased number of patients will be aLo considered. The contemplated outlay for such enlargements will be 130,0801'. Mr. X 3Y presented a memorial from the MaryleboneVestry respecting the proposed alterations of the asylums; v,hich wvas ordered to lie on the table.

After the conclusion of the ordinary businass of the Court the magistrates resolved themselves into a meeting, "<To consider the propriety of forming a society, to becalled the Middlesex Society, to promote the reformation and employment of discharged criminals." Lord Robert Grosvenor, M.P., was called to the chair, and in a brief speech he stated thle urgent need of a society such as that nowv proposed to he formed, te operations of which would prove an important element in criminal reformation. MIr. Pownail followed, and supported the views of the noble chainnan, and a series of resolutions vwere subsequently passed. It was resolved that such a society should be formed, to consist of patrons, a president, and a manaing committee; that such committee be empowered to anpoint a treasurer and secretary; and that the operations of the society should be generaly applicable to the reformatiom and employment of prisoners upon their discharge from the three prisons of the county of Middlesex. Other resolutionsembodied further details, and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Allen, the county treasurer, hon. secretary to the society, aunounced subscriptions to the amount of 210 gulneas, and annual donations of 21 guineas. Lord Robert Grosvenor was appointed president, and Ir. Henry Morris Eenmshed tpeaarp,.-
LNCENDRAiy FiRE EA-R RoTDERHA-.-About 4'clock onWednesday morning a fe broke out at the. Cankldow flour-mills, near Iotherhani, belonging to Messrs. Mioorhouse and Hague. Although an alarm was instantly raised, and several fire-engines from Rotherham were quickly brought to the spot, the flames obtained such a hold of the building that before 5 o'clock the whole of the lamge roof fell in with a tremendous crash, and the fire raged nith uncontrollable fury until the whole place, vith the excep. tion of the walls, was consumed, the timbers being for the miostpartdryandold. A very large quantityof grainin. sack;s nda good deal of flour were destroyed, butthegreater part of the latter article in the ills at the time vwas saved. Four pairs of stones also are comparatively uninjured. TLe building and the stock; were insured, hut a long time oust> elapse before the mill can be restored to workiungcondition. There is but too much reason to fear that the fire was the work of an inlcendiary. No li"ht had been used ra the place for many hours before the fire broLe out, and the prs. mises wvere exaininedrand found safe about an hourb'efore; the part of the building, too, where the fl.-nesawer. flrsb discovered was that mn whichl they wvere most likely to prove destructive. Thlis is the second flour-mill in this sliatrict which has been burnt dowvn after sun set wi thin -thc lastfew- weeks., The first w.as that of Ms HIenry ellolingg, ~cafled Oxapring-rnill, near Barasley, where a fire broke ouil very suddenly, and 'within a short time after the premised had been eamined. On.that occasion the progress of t1I~ flames w-as very rapid, and property to the amount of 6,0004' was destroyed. This fire ws at first.attributed to aoedent4 but subsequent investigation left hittlo roomi to doubt that it wias thewvork of an incenwdiary.
