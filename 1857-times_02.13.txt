1Have always considered it a privilege to have beenl
A,able, in any degree, to assisit in a work so eminently calculated to promnote the well-being ot the poorer classes in our overgrown mnetropOlis and to improve their condition, material, maoral, and social, reneving extremo dlestitution, affording aid and comfort In the seasn of sickasas, and taking away the excuse, for rmeodicanry. One especial feature of the Society's week is the great assstanace which it has rendrdtthparcohial clergy in the imsportait duty of vtingthei
por Pishlsoters from house to house, and by the formation? ofheira Lging Committees to draw closer the bands of Chisitian sympathy and love. Another strikingly beneficial result of the system carried. into eflect by the Association Is the increased nkumber of Provident Societies and Penny Savings-banks, and thke extraordinary amount of money deposited by the working classes of the Metropolis. I must ever feel a deep interest in the success and progress of the Association. -From a lete ot Bishop BlomSaeld, dated Fulham Palace, 13th of Decemnber. 31856.
The separation of the rich and the poor by their separat residences In the east and west of London Is not to be denied. Wben we wander through the splendid streets and spacious squares of the western districts we are inclined 10 exclaim, , Where are the poor?'" We see on eery side the mansions of the wealthy,; we see the hirhly embellished and decorated shops which minister to their luxury ; but we sUcaely see any representatives of the labouring classes of the Metropolis ; and yet, I apprebenc, st Is an unquestionable truth, and the necessary onsi,lt of the law by which wociety is constructed, that every house which is butilt by a nobleman, a banker, or a mnerchant in Belgrave or Eaton squares, or the sadjacent streete, generates a certain amaount of population, which is cast upon the eastern districts, removed out of sight and out of mind, but continually growing and miultiplyinig immortal souls living, dying, and yessing into ithe grave-hundreds and thousands of whom we kinow nothing, hear nothing, whom we never see, and for whom we generally do nothing, This Is undoubtedly a serous and appalling stats of tbines. It is hardly possible to hops that it will receive maore than mitigation ; hut at the same time great mItigation it may receive. As the honoured name of Bishop Blomadeld has been mentioned. I may, perhaps be permitted to remind the meeting that tohim we owe the Metropolitan Visiting and Relief Assocration, which was the dinrt recognition, in a perm~anent form, of the duty of the west towards the east of L-ondon), for it was founded on the express anticipation that through Its medium a pOrtion of the enormous wealth ex mnded on the enjoyments of the west-entd of

The Army Estimates.
THBE ABJIY ESTIMATES.
The ArmyEstimates for the year 1857-58 have followed closely on those for the navy. The sum total required to be voted for the service of the ensuing fnancial year (1857-58) amounts to 11,225,5331., of which 8,993,6581. goes for the effective, and 2,231,8751. for the non-effective. The difference, or reduction of the estimates, as comrared with last year (1856-57), amounts to no less than 9,023,5511., of which 9,015,2021. is under the II effective" branch of the service. The original estimate for 1856-57 amounted to the enormous sum of 34,998,5041., although this was reduced to 20,249,0841. on a revision (peace having been declared early in the year); and accordingly the full extent of the reduction, if we compare the estimates for the ensuing year with the original ones of last, will be 23,772,9711., or the difference between 34,998,5041. and 11, 225,5331.
The actual reduction, we have said, amounts to 9,023,5511., or the difference between 11,225,5331. and 20,249,0841. The items of reduction include a decreaseof 2,045,9731. under the head of pay and allowances to the land forces; a decrease of 1,000,0101. under the head of the embodied militia (for which there is no charge whatever this year); a decrease of 80,8771. under the head of the volunteer corps; a decrease of 250,0101. under the Army Works Corps (for which no charge is made this year) ; a decrease of 6,2131. under the head of the departments of the Secretary of War and the General Commandina-in-Chief; a decrease of 73,7721. under the head of manufacturiDg establishments, storekeepers, barrackmasters, &c.; a decrease of 117,1421. under the head of artificers and labourers' wages; a decrease of 2,625,5401. under the head of clothing and necessaries, provisions, forage, fuel and light, barrack furniture and bedding; a decrease of 1,903,8191. under the head of warlike stores for land and sea service ; a decrease of 899,6861. under the head of fortifications, civil buildings, and barracks; and a decrease of 12,1601. under the head of the educational and scientific branches.
There is an increase of 61,8131. included in three heads under the non-effective heads, viz., 9051. for rewards, 49,6121. for the pay of reduced and retired officers, and 11,2961. for out-pensions. The total collateral decrease is 70,1621., viz., 4,0061. for pay of general officers, 30,0421. for vidows' pensions, &-c., 35,6951. for pensions, &c., to wounded officers, 1551. for in-pensions, and 2641. for superannuation allowances.
The actual grants for this year's service include 4,400,9821. for land forces (pay and allowances), and 553,0551. for misceUaneous charges under this head ; 7,1231. for volunteer corps; 185,6041. for the departments of the Secretary of State for War and the General Commeanding in Chief; 376,2381. for manufacturing establishinents, storekeepers, barrackmasters, &c. ; 332,8681. for artificers and labourers' wages; 418,5701. for clothingandnecessaries; 955,9001. for provisions, forage, fuel, light, furniture, and bedding; 596,1911. for warlike stores for sea and land service; 245,9301. for fortifications; 693,4531. for civil buildings and barracks; and 227,7441. for the educational and scientifc branches. The non-effective items include 26,3051. as rewards for service; 62,9941. for pay of general officers; 568,7061. for pay of reduced and retired officers; 190,3781. for widows' pensionsand compassionate allowances; 47,8631. for pensions to wounded officers; 31,9411. for in-pensions, and 1,179,6881. for out-pensions; and 124,0001. for superannuation allowances.
The number of men required for the service of the year 1857-58 is 126,796, against 246,716 last year-equivalent to a decrease of 119,920. The original estimate of last year was the same as the revised as regards the number of men.
It was shown yesterday that the Navy Estimates for this year effect a saving of 8,188,9871. The saving on the Army Estimates amounts to 9,023,5511.; and the two savings together amount to the sum of 17,212,5331., or, as;was yesterday remarked in a leading article, I,000,0001. more than the produce of the Income-tax last year.

MILITARY AND NAVAL INTELLIGBaOCE.
Yesterday morning the Duke of Cambridge inspected the men now in garrison at Colchester. He was accompanied by Major-General Sir G. A. Wetherall, R.C.B., AdjutantGeneral, and Colonel Tyrwhitt, one of the aides-de-camp to his Royal Highness. They were met by LieutenantGeneral Gascoigne, commander of the district, andcabrilliant staff, Upon his arrival atthe camphis Royal Highness found the 12 depots. comprising three battalions, under the command of Colonel Street, as senior officer, drawn up in heavy marching order. There were in the aggregate about 2,500 nen, who received the Commnander-in-Chief with a Royal salute, the bands playingtheNational Anthem. The men then went through tho exercises of a general parade, the limiied size of the parade-ground preventing any complicated evolutions, and, the troops having been dismissed to iheir quarters, his Royal Highness afterwards proceeded to the inspection of the camp. The schools, both for infants and boys and girls, were the first objects of his Royal Highness's attention-one class of boys being questionedinarithmeticby the Commander-in-Chief, who expressed his pleasure at the efficiency which they displayed in this particular branch of their studies. The schoolroom for instruction in musketry, the married and single men's huts, the sergeants' messroom and kitchen, the new military prison, and cookhouses and washhouse, were inspected, and, his Royal Highness having conversed with Lieutenant-Colonel Armstrong, Colonel Street, and Colonel Whitmore, the officers in command of the several battalions, left the camp to inspect the farm, situated about two miles from the camp, recently purchased by Government for the purpose of musketry practice. His Royal Eighness returned to London by the 2 p.m. train.
Lieutenant-General Sir Charles W. Pasley, R.C.B., R.E., paid a visit to Chatham garrison on Wednesday for the purpose of inspecting the pontoons which were brought home from Kertch by the troops of the Turkish Engineer Corps, and deposited with the otber stores on the Gunwharf, under the direction of Captain G. AllaIl. The pontoons, which are of the same description as those invented by Major-General Blanshard, and now used in the corps of Royal Engineers, are 64 in number, and occupy a considerable space. On being landed they were placed on the pontoon-waggons, where they have since remained, but as soon as accommodation can be provided for them at Brompton Barracks they will be removed to that establishement, to be used by the men of the Royal Engineers in their pontooning experiments. General Pasley made a careful inspection of the whole of the pontoons, which appear to be in good condition and fit for use. During his visit to Chatham Sir Charles Pasley also inspected a newly-invented iron gabion, which has received the approval of General Sir John Burgoyne, InspectorGeneral of Fortifications, and other engineer officers.
The reduction in the army is still being carried on at Chatham, and yesterday morning 68 non-commissioned officers and men received their discharge.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The officers whose characters are principally impugned by Colonel Tnlloch's able reply to the report of i he seven sages of Chelsea discreetly remain silent; but I see that one or two of the subordinates have made their appearance in print during the last few days, feebly attempting to shake the Colonel's facts.
Major Conolly, writing to you from Aldershott on the 3d inst., denies that his evidence " has been placed in an awkward predicament" by the disclosure of Lord Lucan's order reproving the Lieutenant-Colonels of the Light Brigade for their utter indifference to the lives of their horses. He declares that he especially guarded himself by stating that he could only answer for the Heavy Brigade, to which that order did not apply.
Reference to the report of the commission will show the facts to be these :-Major Conolly was asked (5th question) whether he could explain certain returns connected with the cavalry division. He answered that he could only explain them as far as the Heavy Brigade was concerned. Some time afterwards he was ask-ed by Lord Lucan (19th question),-" Is it your opinion that there might have been on the part of myself, or of officers commanding brigades or regiments, more promptitade and ingenuity in sheltering the horses than was displayed under the circumstances in which we were placed?'
To this Major Conolly answered that he did not believe that anything more could have been done "by the officers commanding brigades or regiments" than was done. He made no reservation as to his knowledge on this point extending only to the Heavy Cavalry, nor could he well have done so, for in his position, as Lord Lucan's Brigade Major, he must have copied and circulated the very order of that nobleman, dated Jantary 20, 1855, censuring in the bitterest terms the Light Cavalry Brigade for their culpable neglect of their horses.
Colonel Wetherall, in your impression of the 11th, de. (lares "that he is perfectly willing to abide by his evidence given before the Board of General Officers, taken as a whole, but that he cannot be expected to acknowledge partial extracts by a prejudiced person relating to diflerent subjects, though placed in juxtaposition to give an appearance of contradiction."
This means in plain English that Colonel Wetherall does not desire that his evidence should be sifted-that he claims on his own part an exemption from an ordeal to which Sir John M'Neill and Colonel Tulloch were somewhat exorbitantly subjected by himself and his friends.
He reproaches Colonel Tulloch with the alterations made in his evidence, and with the circumstance of his not having signed it; but he carefully refrains from adding that the fault-if fault there be-entirely rests with his friend and colleague, Colonel Gordon, who very prudently holds his peace.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
2H.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THB EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I shaU esteem it a favour if you wiU afford me a small space in your valuable columns for a few remarks, as much condensed as possible, on the observations of Colonel Tulloch in his lately published book, page S.
The Colonel assumes that my evidence before the Chelsea Board and that of others are shaken,Lord Lucan's case overturned, and his own imputations on the whole of the British cavalry warranted by Lord Lucan's order reprehending the Light Brigade on the 20th of January, 1855. I had the honour to command the Heavy Brigade at the period alluded to. My evidence referred chiefly as to the doings of the Heavy Brigade, but I have no wish to ignore the
.ight.
With reference to the Heavy Brigade, which might more properly be said to represent the cavalry than the Light Brigade could in its reduced state, my evidence is strengthened by Lord Lucan's order of the 20th of January, which -marks the progress made by us.
I affirm that, consistently with our other duties, the Heavy Brigade lost no time, spared no labour, and resorted to every means within our reach. Officers as weU as men worked with shovel, pickaxe, and hammer, not exoepting the General of the Brigade. The horses were made to drag up plankls attached to the saddles, and were put, contrary to all rule, in mule-carts, when they could be procured, and harness improvised, if not of leather, certainly not of " red tape."
The horses of the Light Brigade came down from the plateau completely exhausted from starvation, and could only go for forage and take the picket duties. They attempted for a few days to carry provisions to the front and bring down sick, but were obliged to relinquish those duties to the Heavy Brigade. The men of the Light Brigade brought up planks for huts, hospitals, and stables; but they could not be erected, as I was informed by Brigadier-General Shewell, who commanded the Brigade, for want of scantlings and uprights, before the 20th of January.
It will be seen by Major Hall's returns that for the artillery, cavalry, and troops near Balaklava nearly 9,000 scantlings were required, and no more than 5,400 were landed before the 3d of February, of which the Artilery got the greater part, having carts to convey them. Probably Lord Lucan was not aware of this fact when he gave the order. His anxiety was unceasing, but, unfortunately, it is easier to order than to execute. I mean no disrespect or censure on his Lordship.
Colonel Tuloch points to Aldershott and Algeria as examples of what may be done. At Aldershott, with skiUed worlunen from the Sappers, infantry fatigues, and naval riggers from Portsmouth, it took our engineers from the 20th of August to the 15th of November to erect seven canvass-covered stables for 608 horses, and one roof has been since blown away.
With an African temperature, the protection he describes in Algeria might be sufficient against a summer storm, but that it would not be against a Crimean winter climate our galant allies as weU as ourselves have discovered.
I could enlarge much upon this subject if I did not fear to trespass on your coluTmns.
I have the honour to be your obedient servant.

DUBLIN, TnupsDAY MOaING. THE ELECTIONS.
The nornination for Bandon took place on Wedcnesday (yesterday), and, as opposition is of rather rare occurrence in that highly orthodox family borough, the proceedings were distinguished on the present occasion by a fair amount of the ordinary excitement of an Irish contested election. The candidates are the Hon. Captain Bernard and Mr. Shaw-the former as the supporter of the Derby policy, the latter making his first bow in the Liberal interest. Both gentlemen being duly proposed and seconded, a show of hands was called for, which was declared to be in favour of M,Ir. Shaw. The polling is fixed for Friday. -
The polling at Downpatrick commenced on Wednesday morning at 8 o'clock, and shortly after that hour the agent of Mr. Johnston raised a technical objection to the registry of voters. The assessor stated that the objection could only be decided by a committee of the House of Commons, to which tribunal the agent said he would appeal. Mr. Johnston did not ao to a poll, resting his claim to the return on the show of hands. For lr. Ker there were 137 votes recorded, Mr. Johnston was subsequently drawn in triumph through several of the principal streets in an open carriage, and so ended the play.
It is believed that the Tensnt League, unabashed by the total loss of the minimum share of confidence which it once enjoyed, means to interfere in the coming election for the county of Londonderry, a seat for which is vacant by the regretted retirement of Captain Bateson, one of the most popular of Lord Derby's Irish suppDorters. Mr. S. Greer, a barrister, and formerly a member of the League, is spoken of as a candidate. He has lately purchased property in the county and, is popular with his new tenants.
AN ASSASSIN AT FAULT.
A letter from the King's County, published in Saunders's of this morning, nirrates the following circumstance:-
"' A few nights ago a gentleman who had* arrived by the late train at Tullamore, when proceeding in a car to his residence near Frankford, was alarmed by a ruffian armed with a gun, who leaped out of the ditch on the roadside, about a mile and a half from Tnllamore, surveyed the car, and, having attentively looked in the face of the occupant, told him to drive on, as ' he was not the gentleman he was looking for.' The gentleman shortly after met some policemen, to whom he reported the occ.urrence."

The Brewing Monopoly.
THE BREWING MONOPOLY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Mr. Hardy obtained leave on Tuesdav last to bring in a bill to amend the laws regulating the sale of beer-which are, indeed, sadly in want of amendment.
A committee which sat in 1853 and 1854, under the presidency of the Right Hon. Charles Villiers, inquired thoroughly into the existing laws on this subject, and came unanimouslyto the conclusion that the best method of dealing with it was to throw the trade open under certain necessary police restrictions; and I have no doubt but that the recommendations of that committee would have been acted upon long since had it not been for the breaking out of the war, which put a stop to all measures of social improvement.
Mr. Eardy has now revived the question, but his views appear to be those of a few interested monopolists, who wish to close the beerhouses, and to throw the -whole trade into the hands of the publichouse proprietary. I have little fear of his succeeding in his object; but so great is the influence of the brewing interest throughout England that I do not think any Government will be disposed to legislate upon the recommendations of the committee of 1853-4 with a general election imminent. However, nothing but good can come from a further ventilation of the subject; the more it is inquired into the more the interested views of the parties who are prompting Mr. Hardy will come to light.
The beerhouse act of 1830 has, I admit, proved a total failure, because the beerhouse keepers, allowed to sell beer alone, under very crippling restrictions, have been called upon to compete with the licensed victuallers-allowed to sell wine and spirits as well as beer, and to keep their houses open at times when the beerhouse keepers are compelled to close theirs. The consequence has been that the beerhouse trade has generally been a losing game, only played by desperate and stnrggling men, of insufficient capital and doubtful character.
But if Mr. Hardy will propose that a publican's license shall be freely given to every beerhousekeeper, and that this class of tradesmen shall be allowed to compete on even terms with the publiCans, capital will be instantly attracted into their impoverished trade, and the beerhouse keeper will be at least as respectable a person as the publican.
Curiously enough, the argument which the brewers, who are at the bottom of the present agitation against the act of 1830, urge against throwing the trade open is that such a change would enormously increase the consumption of beer !
Imagine bakers objecting from conscientious motives to an increased consumption of bread, or butchers of meat! They also inveigh very much against the moral qualifications of the beerhouse keepers. They say that they are not so respectable a class of men as the publicans.
It is undoubtedly true that they are not so rich, for the obvious reasons I have already given; but I do not think that a trade which is the normal refuge of retired prize-fighters is in a position to cast stones against any other trade for its defective respectability.
There is a good deal more to be said on the matter, with which I will not now trouble you. I promise, however, that Mr. Hardy and his biU shall enjoy the fuU attention of
Your old friend and correspondent.

Election Intelligence.
ELECTIO2y IYTELLIGENCB. HERBEFORD.
The nomination took place at the old Town-hall yesterday, the Mayor, Mr. William George, presiding. There was a large attendance of electors and non-electors.
Mr. C. T. BODNHA'M, of Rotherwas, proposed, and Mr. Alderman ANTHoNy seconded, the nomination of Mr. George Clive, the Liberal candidate.
Mr. F. EL THomAs and Mr. EDWARD WEMY,9S oerformed the like office for Mr. Kevill Davies, the candidate brought forward by the To;ry t.
Mr. CLuvz first addre t e electors at considerable length. He stated that ho sought the suffrages of the electors as a genuine Liberal, and an independent supporter of the Palmerston Government, because, in his opinion, that Government comprised the legitimate successors of the men who carried the Reform Bill, and, in fact, all liberl measures from the time when the Tories were first dispossessed of office down to the present period. It 'Was true that the credit of passing liberal measures was claimed on all sides, and that eminent Conservative statesman, Sir J. Pakington-for whom he prophesied the post of Secretary of State in the event of his party obtaining power-had been recommending " perseverance" as the only way to secure an extension of education, showing that the Reform Bill, Catholic Emancipation, and the repeal of the corn laws had. been carried by perseverance; in fact, claiming for Conservative statesmen the parentage of all those great measures. He was Also prepared to support LordPalmerston's Government, because theyhad brought the Russian war to a satisfactory termination. ("Oh, oh," from the Tories.) No doubt many thought that a better peace might have been made and would not have been unwilling for Russia to have had another year of the war; but, for his own part, he thought the Govermuent had made the best peacethey could. Austria was unwilling to go on longer, France had had quite enough, and England was left in the position that she must have continued thecontest alone. And no one, he felt, would wish England to meddle with Euro liti and fight the battle of freedom there by hersel. (Applause.) He dissented from the supposition that the power of Russia had not been weakened, and, having given some facts in reference to her great loss of men, he mame next to the question of the income-tax. His belief was that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had no intention to continue the impost of what was called the s war ninepence," unless it was necessary to do so for the purpose of paying debts already contracted, lf this were not clearly shown to be the fact, he was prepared to vote for the abolition of that part of the tax in April next. He professed himself anxious for a reform of the law, particularly referring to the laws arfecting the transfer of lan d and the system of ecclesikstical tenures as requiring amelioration. Oa the question of dealingwith our criminal population, ho was opposed to the ticket-of-leave system, and said it was quite clear that our homes must be kept sacred from men who, after a year or two's imprisonment, are enabled to get a remission of their sentences by making a number of civil speeches to the chaplain. But then, what are we do with these men, some of whom were no doubt sincere in their professions of repentance, and would, if they could surmount the obstacles that beset them, return to the paths of honesty? "Transport them" might be the response; hut our colonies will not have them, and he came to the conclusion that our convicts must be employed, during the term of their sentence, in suck works as the construction of harbours and docks-works which might not be otherwise undertaken. On the question of education he contended that the tendency of the age being to extend the franchise, it wonld be more prudent to prepare the people for the exercise of that power by educational means than by extending the franchise without the accompaninesit of education. He was therefore in favour of thegeneral extension of education, and thought no one could object to see a good school in every parish. The hon. candidate next touched upon the ballot question, and after expressing himself very strongly on the necessity for the adoption of some measure to secure the voter in the rightful exercise of his trust, he said he was prepared to vote for the ballot, or any other measure which would secure the desired object, if it were at all reasonable and likely to command public approbation. Coming to the subject of churoh-rates
ir. Clive said he was willing to support Sir IV Clay's bill should it be brought into Parliament, and on the subject of opening places of public amusement on a Sunday, he pointed out the evils resulting from the absence of proper places of resort for the poor on the Sabbath, and expressed himself in favour of their having access to parks, but for nio money to be taken. FinaUyy M. Clive referred to the Maynooth grant, and, after sketching its origin and history, announced his determination to support it as an arrangement which must be maintained, contending that it is far better to have An educated than an uneducated priestbood, and far better that that priesthood should be educated in Ireland than abroad. (Applause.)
lfr. KEVILL DAviEs then addressed the meeting. He came before them unfettered to any particular line of policy, but independently as a country gentleman residing among them, one having a stake in the county and not a stranger but whose interests were mixed up with them in avsry possible way. Having alluded in terms of regret to the retirement of Mr. Evans (the Conservatiye candidate who had canvassed the town, but had withdrawn from tho contert by medical advice), and to the retirement of Sir R. Price, and the precipitancy vith which the subsequent proceedings had been taken, he repudiated an assertion that he was a Derbyite and a supporter of the tax upon bread, and said he had no desire to see a duty upon corn. He was not a Protectionist, for that subject was dead. Speaking of the income-tax, he said he was decidedly an advocate for the imnediate repealof the war 9d., andfor abolishingthe remaining 7d. in 1860. (Cheers.) Re found fault with the inanner in which trades and professions are taxed equaUy with property and positive incomes, and if elected he would advocate that a great portion, if not the whole, should be taken off the trading and professional communities, and the same equally imposed upon all certain incomes. As to the ballot, he was himself in favour of its being tried, but on a matter of such vital importance to the counatry, connected so intimately with the best interests of the country and with the returning of members to Parliament, he would not, before such a meeting as the present, Rledge himself to say what measure he would support. With respect to the MIaynooth grant, he thought it was a subject upon which the voters of every constituency had a riht to expect their representative to act accordinig to the feeling of the majority of his constituency. If that were the only ground he should be prepared to vote against the grant, because the question of the internal tenets of religious faith of the whole constitution were involved. Connected aith that was another subject which might come before Parliament, and one of equal importance-the Government ispection of nunneries. (Hear, hear.) He should vote moet decidedly for All nunneries in England and Great Britain being inspected by Governmert. (Cheers.) The subject of education affected tbo religious liberty of the country, and was one of the greatest possible importance. In it Dissenters as weU as Church people were equally concerned, and he would advocate any measure for a
eneral plan of education throughout England, for the Dnefit of Churchmen and Dissenters alike, without any relation to rel1giou opinions. (Cbeers.)
A Voice.-W at about the church-rates ?
Considerable uproar ensued, and a hundred voices took up the cry "What about the church-rates 2" "Don'tshirk the question !" " Speak out !" &c.
Mr. DAVIES.-I am perfectly ready to givo you an answer upon the subjectof church-rates. (Hear. hear.) I will not say I am for the abolition of church-rates altogether; but, if returned, I would support a meamire for doing away with that part of church-rates which is placed upon Dissenters who ao not belong to the Church of England altogether, providing some other substitute were made for keeping the waaUs of the Church of England together, so that they may not fall to the ground.
The MY OR inquired whether Anybody else had a candidate to propose.
As there was no reply he proceeded to take a show of hands, submitting the names of the candidates in the order they were proposed.
The MAYOR declared the show of hands to be in favour of Mr. Clive. The Conservatives dissented, and denounced the decision as unfair, and a scene of disturbance followed, which lasted for some time. As the Mayor did not accede to the request that another show might be taken, or a division made, a poll was demanded for blr. Davies, and the proceedings terminated.
LEICESTERSHIRE (NORTH).
Mr. Frowen has resigned the contest for iNorth Leicestershire. The constituency comprises in all about3O,600; of these, 1,756 signed the requisition to Lord' John Manners. The canvass returns show a majority of at least 10 to 1 in favour of Lord Jobn. In one district, where it was supposed that Mr. Frewen had strong interest, the returns were 319 for Lord John, 14 for Frewen, 30 neuter, and 5 dead. Li the Melton district, which comprises more than half of the whole voters, the electors were almost to a man in favour of Lord John. Mr. Frewen had secured as his agents the chief electioneering agents of the Tory and Radical parties, and the cry of "No Popery !" was raised in every viUage. During the past week he has posted and circulated upwards of 20,000 handbils, and exlisted in his favour aU who would recaU the grant to Maynooth, whether Dissenters or Churchmen; but it was utterly impossible to make head against the Rutland interest, and his agents gave up the contest. It is believed that in thei whole county they had not secured 200 votes.

Anti-Income-Tax Meeting In Marylebone.
.LNTI-INCOifE-TAX MEETING 1N MARYLE. BOSE.
Ist evening a public meeting of the inhabitanta and resident electors of Middlesex was held in the theatre of the Literary Institution, Edward-street, Portman-square, "to take Into consideration the measures to be adopted in consequence of the continued silence of the Government on the repeal of the war income-tax of 9d. in the pound4"
Mr. Jacob Bell was at 8 o'clock called to the chair,' and the spacious theatre of the institution was denselg crowded.
On t e platform were Sir James Duke, XP., Mr. James Bell, MP., Messrs. Nicholay, D'iffauger, C. Lewis, Polaud, lavener Clement Genge, )Iajor Lyon, Hodges, Dr Gray, &C. e the Chairman was ODening the business of the meeting Sir Benjamin Hall, P d m e his appearance upon the platform, and was received with three rounds of cheering.
The COsIRs1A said the Government had been so silent npon what their intentions were with reference to this most obnoxious income-tax, that there had been an agitation on the subiect from one end of the kingdom to the other. (Hear, hea.) Not one word upon the subject had appeared in the Queen's Speech. (Hear. ) He was quite certain that bad the Chancellor of the Exchequer only given Her Majesty a little hint nothing would more have delighted Her lajesty than to have been the medium of announcing to her people the removal of this impost. (Applause ) It had, however, crept out thst there was such a large reduction in the army and navy estimates that there was a probabiity that the war ninepence would come off; at the rame time the people must continue alive to their omn interests.

Legal Cruelty.
LEGAL CRUELTY.
TO THE EDITOIt OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In copying a paragraph with the above heading from one of our county newspapers youhave givenvery wide publicity to an unfounded imputation on tho justices here of having passed "a horribly absurd sentence" in committing a boy to prison for non-payment of a fine ihaposed upon him for throwing stones in the street. I am quite ready to acknowledge the advantages we derive from fair reports being published of proceedings in our courts of Justice, but magistrates have an onerous and a very thankless office to perform, often incurring the hostility of thoso whom they are constrained to punish, and it is not advisablo that they should be further held up to odium by the public press upon cx partc statements, especiaUly when the writer admits that he does "not know the facts of the case." Divested of those ornaments with which it has been decked in order to obtain commiseration for the offender-" the little tunic and belt, the cyclopin arch and massive ruggedness of the prison, the cold shudder of the provincial editor"-will you permit me to state very briefly what are the real circumstarces ? The pastime of pelting stones is somewhat too prevalent here among our rising generation. One person has in this way been senously maimed, losing, I believe, the sight of an eye, and women on horseback are often thus exposed to very serious danger. In the present case the inhabitants of a particular locality complained that they were subject to continual disturbance by having stones thrown against their doors, and the police were directed to apprehend any one found so oflending. The boy who was subsequently taken into custody admitted his offence, and was fined 18d., the costs making the whole penalty 5s., which his mother, who was present, and who complained loudly of our u)justice, refused to pay. Being cautioned that tho consequence of such refusal must be her son's isuprisonment, she answered distinctly that she did not care, and that ho might go to gaol. A week, however, was given her for further consideration, when, the fine not being forthcoming, and no person appearing on behalf of the boy, he was necessarnly couimitted under the provisions of Jervis's act. The fathor, a mechanic, earning good wages, who complains in his letter that he "could not raise the money," did not attend the bench on either occasion, and actually had betweeu 1L and 2C lodged for another purpose in the hands of the clerk, witls which he was urged to pay the fine, but he positively refused. Now, we permit no one to take the law into their own hands. A gentleman having been fined here on complaint of a parent for excessivelr chastising his child, who had thrown a stone at his carriage, it is clear that if lads of 9 or even 15 years old, who usuaUy possess no property of their own, are to be exempt from imprisonment, they may commit with impunity aU the offences for which pecuniary penalties are directed to be imposed, and this town, which is a resort for numerous visitors and invalids, would be almost deserted. It may be true, however, that the existing law is defective and it might be better if authority were given to inflict summary whipping in such cases, or thalt the warrant of distress should issue against the parents, through whore negligence it usually occurs that their children faUl into snisehief,

Thursday Evening.
The publication of the Navyand Army Estimates, showing a reduction of 17,00t3,0001. in the requirements for the approaching financial year, coupled with the confirmation of the announcement that the Persian questionI has been arranged, have caused the funds to-day to experience a further improvement of a half per cent. Consols for money, which left off last evening at 93g to i, were first quoted 93O to i, whence they steadily advanced to 94. From this rise there was scarcely any reaction, and the last official priceswere 93; for money, and 94i to ; for the 5th of March. After regular hours transactions took place at a fresh advance of an eighth, but this additional niovemeut was not upheld. Several large purchases were effected during the day, and it is conjectured that some of the persons -who have lately been lending money on stock have appeared as permanent investors. The expectation of any new measures of restriction on the part of the Bank of England having for the time entirely subsided, the breaking up of the weekly Court without any change being notified exercised no influence on the market. One favourable circumstance at present in operation is, that the 2,000,0001. of Exchequer-bonds, series C., become redeemable on the 8th of May next. Bank Stock closed at 216 to 218; Reduced, 94 to J ; New Three per Cents., 94w; India Stock, 218 to 220; India Bonds, 2s. discount to Is. premium; Exchequer-bonds, 98 to J; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. prenium.
In the Stock-Exchange there was a full supply of money, and loans on Government securities were freely offered at 0 per cent. In the discount-market and at the Bank of England there were likewise signs of increasing ease.
The loan of iG,OO,0001., negotiated in May, 1855, was arranged to be extinguished by a sinking fund of l,OOO,0OO1. per annum, to commence in twelve months fronm the ratification of a treaty of peace. As the Government have intimated that they do not intend in the case of the income-tax to take advantage of the fact of this ratification having been delayed until a few days after the commencement of the last financial year, the question has arisen whether they will not adopt an analogous view with regard to this case. The reasonable assumption would be that the same rule should apply to both; but there are objections which may possibly operate against altering, under any circumstances, the strict letter of a money contract.
In foreign stocks the transactions were limited, but there was a further considerable recovery ia Turlish. The Six per Cents., which closed yesterday at 94I, were marked 94p, g, and I for money, and 95, 941, 9-1, and J for the account. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the operations were at 1011 and 101 for money, and 0 and for the account. The other business comprised Brazilian Five per Cents., New, for the account, 103 and 1023-; Mexican, 22 and 21z for money, and 22 for the account; Spanish, 40i and J; Ditto Deferred, 24 and 24k; Ditto Certificates, 61; Dutch Twoand-a-Half per Cents., 65,, and ditto Four per Cents., 984.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 25c. for money, and 68f. SSc. for the end of the month, showing an improvement of between an eighth and a quarter per cent. At Amsterdam and Vienna the markets also exhibit steadiness.
All the continental exchanges continue to present a favourable appearance.
The letters from Paris mention that a commission has been appointed to consider the currency question, who will doubtless report on the advantage or otherwise of adopting an exclusively gold standard. The question of the tax on public companies is still in uncertainty as regards the form in which it is to be imposed. According to some accounts, there is to be a charge of 3 per cent. on the dividends, and of i per cent. on transfers. Nothing more has transpired regarding the projected visit of M. Mires to London to negotiate for the arrangement of the Spanish confiscated coupons. It is to be feared the holders may yet meet with frequent disappointments, unless they come to some public resolution to insist upon higher terms in proportion to the delay that may occur in settling with them.
The commercial advices from New York to-day contain little of interest, the long-continued frost having interfered with most departments of business. The stock-market, however, was fairly supported, and some descriptions, especially lllinois Central and Panama, had again advanced. The latest quotations were Erie, 62i; Reading, 811 to 82; New York Central, 94 to i; Panama, 97 to ; Illinois Central, 128i; and Illnois Central Boni, 98X. The improvement in Panama was chiefly attributable to the total stoppage of the Nicaragua route by the seizure of Walker's steamers. There was a good demand for imported goods, and the prospects of the spring trade were still favourable. At Boston there had been two failures-C. B. Fessenden, for about 100,0001., and Wetherell, Brothers, for 50,0001. The Merchants' Bank of New York have announced an intended increase of their capital from 300,0001. to 600f,O00. A return just published of the railways in operation in the United States showed the total at the end of 1856 to be 24,47,6 miles, against 21,069 in the previous year, the addition in the 12 months having been 3,407 miles.
The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 1082 per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is against England; but, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between the two countries.
The annexed letter from Mr. Freshfield states the course he has pursued in relation to the dock warrant Question. It would now appear to be the duty of the committee to publish the communication they have received, together with any remarks upon it they may deem necessary -

N&TTINGH , THUBZSD,Y.
A slight improvement continues in tho lace trade. The season has not, however, yet set in, and manufacturers are demurring as to what description of goods they should pro. duce. For a considerable time past there has been an excellent inquiry for plain nets, which have realized high prices. The demand is increasing for the home market, and there are also orders for export; silks and yarns continue extremely high.
The hosiery trade is brisk, fresh orders having been received. Manufacturers kept their stocks low, and the present active demand has caused this branch of the staple trade of the town to be exceediTSly busy.
LEICESTER, TX[uRsDAY.
The hosiery trade is improving to a slight extent, and there is now almost as much doing as is generally the ca'e at this period of the year. There is a fair amount of business transacting in cotton goods; for other articles there is not much inq oo d yarns continue high.

NEGROES O'N VIEW.-The roonr might be said to be occupied by three distinct groups. ConspicuouslY raised above the rest, upon a rude p9atfonn flanked on both sids by two steps, stood the dealer with his uplifted right hand, taking the bids, while with the left hand he pointed to a young negress, of some 15 or 16 years of age, standing at his side. Holding her petticoat on the ground, immediately beneath, stood a black help, or assistant, who looked round at the bidders as the sum kept swelling from 600, 700, to 800 dollars. Next came, in frowsy array, the purchasers, decked in hats in every state of decomposition; some in swallow-tail coats, and rusty unlackered boots, grimy with dirt, and holding either clubs or wicked-lookin,g whips in their bands. The girl was knocked down to one of these. The third party, and forming a fitting background to the scene, were the negroes huddled together on rude benches, awaiting their fate. The first to be selected from them was a gaunt and sinewy hand. A sort of line was formed by the dealers, and this lot was made to p ace up and down the room at a quick trot. This ambling done, it was suggewted that one of his eyes was affected; so they gathered round the negro. One gentlerman rivetted, with the precision of long PraciUce, his thumb into the socket of the eye which 'was suposed to be the sane one, while he held up to the otherahair!

PARLIA .fJI;NTARY INTBLLIG!ENCE.
HOUSE OF LORDS, THURSDAY, FEB. 12.
The LORD CHANCELLOR took his seat on the woolsack at 5 o'clock.
Lord TAL'SOT DE MALAHMDE, recently created an English peer, took the oaths and his seat as a member of their lordshipe' house. His lordship was introduced by Lord Monteagle and Lord Massereene.
THE KINGDOM OF GREECE.
The Marquis of CLANRICARDE asked the Secretary oE State for Foreign Affairs whether a statement which had appeared in the public papers was correct relating to the intended withdrawal of our troops from the kingdom of Greece, and to some arrangement said to have been entered into with the Government of that country with respect t:, the management of their finances; and whether, if that were Eo, the noble earl would have any objection to lay on th 3 table any correspondence that had taken place on the subject 9
The Earl of CLARENDON said, he was glad to have an opportunity of answering the question put to him by his noble friend. The troops were sent out to Greece at a time when a spirit of hostility bad manifested itself in that country towards the Western Powers, and when a successful attempt was made to incite insurrection in the neighbounrig provinces of Turkey. It was accordingly agreed by Her Majesty's Government and the Government of France to send a small force to the Piriuns in order to check any further insurrection, the apprehension of which caused some alarm and the prospect of much trouble and expense. That measure was quite successful. Those troops never have moved from the Firenus, and, the war being over, they would be withdrawn. But in the course of the last autumn the Greek Government laid before the three protecting Powers a statement of the revenue and expenditure of Greece, agreeing to pay a small annual instalment of the interest on the loan guaranteed by those three Powers, and which has been exclusively paid by them ever since the loan was made. The Greek Government at the same time suggested thatthe protecting Powers might prefer, instead of receiving the smal instalment of interest. to allow it to be applied to the internal improvement and the development of the resources of the country. Her Majesty's Government, however, could not agree to thas proposal, first of all because it was clear that by a better arrangement the revenues of the country might be increased; and, again, although the capital might be applied to developing the internal resources of Greece, Her Majesty's Government could not sanction the application of money in the way proposed which belonged to the treasury of England. But, as the Greek Government challenged inquiry as to the accuracy of the financial statement transmitted by them, Her Majesty's proposed that a commission, consisting of the three Ministers of the protecting Powers, should inquire into the correctness of the statement which had beee laid before them by the Greek Governnent. The statement was laid before Her Majesty's Government as creditors, and as creditors they proposed to inquire into the accuracy of it. The proposal was made to the Russian Government, who concurred in it, and expressed their wish to take part in the commission. Some little deLay had arisen in respect to the real attributes of the commission, and its duration - butthe commission itself bad been accepted in the most franic and cordial manner by the Greek Government. He had also to say that this proposal had been made in a perfectly friendly spirit to the Greek Government, and with no intention whatever of interfering in the internal affairs of their kingdom, or that the commission should last beyond the time for which it was established. The protecting Powers were about to render essential service to Greece by the advice and assistauce which the commissioners would be able to render to her Government, and it was expected that the Greek Government might in this way have it in their power to effect certain administrative and financial reforms, which single-banded, they would not be able to achieve. He believed the commission would be established in a few days, and he hoped it would tend eventually to put an end to the contests and asperities which had so often distracted and wonnded the public feeling of that unfortunate country. (Hear, hear.) He believed the only, correspondence ojn the subject had been between the Russian and the French Governments as to the business which the commission should really undertake; and before the commission was established he thought it would be improper to lay the correspondence on the table. (Hear, hear.)
Lord BROUGHAM presented a large number of petitions against the income-tax, complaining particularly of the tax as it affected incomes under 1501. a-year, and expressed a renewed hope that the Government intended to abolish the war 9d.
Lord RAVENSWORTH presented a petition on the subject of the motion of which he had given notice, and praying for the formation of a harbour of refuge on the northeastern coast of this kingdom.
SECONDARY PUNISHhMENTS.
The Marquis of SALISBURY, in calling attention to this subject, said, he did not intend to enter at all into the-nuch disputed subject of transportation. He perceived with some degree of satisfaction that the Secretary of State had completely altered his opinion on this question. Last year when he (the Marquis of Salisbury) brought the subject before their lordships, lie was told that the existing system was entirely successful, that returns would be presented showing its complete success, and noble lords opposite treated the whole thing, in point of fact, as an ima gmary grievance. He was glad, however, to see that their opinions had changed, and that the Secretary of State had now thought it right to introduce a bill, though judging from tho tenor of the right hon. gentleman's speech he feared it would be found a rather inefficient one. From another measure introduced by the Home Secretary-that relating to reformatories-he hoped for very good results. One part of this question, namely, the state of our pisons, had excited of late considerable attention, and that state had been pronounced a very unsatisfactory one. As regarded military prisons and civil prisons, the discipline and diet in the former were much more severe than in the latter; and, in point of fact, the honest labourer was not able to live as well as offenders against the law. The noble lord then proceeded to refer to statistics, which showed that the quantity of solid food alowed to prisoners in civil prisons considerably exceeded that allowed to persons in military prisons and poorhouses, and expressed his belief that the present system in force in civil prisons did not deter persons from the commission of crime, as to a oertain extent was nmanifested by the recommittals to military prisons being considerably fewer in number than those to civi prisons. The noble lord then moved for a select committee to consider the question of secondary punishmnents.
Earl GRANVILLE regretted that he should not be able to accede to the motion which the noble marquis had submitted to the House, but he thought that thel noble marqus had hardly made out a case at this time for the committee which he had proposed. Last year committees of both Houses sat upon the general question of secondary punishments, and the course which they adopted upon that occasion appeared to him to be a very judicious one, for, instead of both examining precisely the same witnesses and going over exactly the same topics, they came to an understanding by which one committee took up one part of the subject while the other devoted itself to another part. In that manner their lordships obtained much valuable information upon the subject of transportation generally, while before the committee of the other House very little evidence, comparatively speaking, was given upon that point, and the witnesses were examined principally upon the questions of punishment, penal servitude, prison discipline, and labour on thepublic works. Under these circumstances he thought that it was not necessary for their lordships to institute a committee at this time to go over either of the grounds which were then inquired into. The noble marquis did not wish that the committee should investigate the general question of transportation ; but his principal arguments were based upon t e condition of different prisons and upon the superiority of the results obtained in military prisons over those obtained in civil prisons. The noble marquis referred for example to the lower scale of dietary and to the less frequent recommitments in the milltary prisons; but there were great differences in all the circumstances between the persons who were committed to military and those who were confined in civil prisons. In the former the imprisonment was almost always for short terms, and it was not until a prisoiier had been confined some time that the low diet began to tell upon his health. So also with regard to recommittals-there was an obvious difference between the two lasses of prisoners. In one casethe prisoners met with persons belonging to the same criminal "profession," he might almost call it, and the inevitable consequence when they associated was that they became hardened, and having no work to go to when they came out they were extremely likely to be recommitted, The soldier was different in this respect, both with regard to the contamination which he
mt with i a and his employment when he came out. Moreoer,n i.t wasprobanblethai the statistics of comparison were not altogether to be relied upon, because the recommittal of soldiers might not be so accurately retorted as was the case with civilians, owing to regiments being fre. quently moved from the mother country to the various colonies, which made it more dffficultth trace the men. (Hear.) The noble marquis had spoken with great candorr and satisfaction of the measures which the Government had taken on this subject. The plan which had been announced in the other house had thus far been received with favour; but,
mneane yet podu bad, it was certainly the most complete
measure yet produced. For any practical result there was
no comparison between a proposal of that kind and an in-
quiry wnthout any definite object. He was not prepared, after the experience of past years, to give any distiiict pledge as to the arival of bills from the other house; but it was the firm dete;mination of the Government to lose no time in attempting to pass the measure through the house of Commons, and to send it up to their lordships at a reasonable time. With regard to the employment of con iots on public works, he could assure the noble marquis that it had not been lost sight of by the Government; on the contrary, it had been most carefully considered ; but unless the feeling of the House was almost unanimous he should be inclined to request his noble friend not to press his motion for the appointment of a committee. (sear, hear.)
Earl STANHOPE observed that, as the person who moved the appointment of the committee of last year, he felt bound to make a few remarks on the present occasion. He fuUy acknowledged the praiseworthy objects which the noble marquis had in view; but, at the same time, it appeared to him that those objects would be hindered rather than promoted by the appointment of a committee. Inquiry was in its place last year, but the time for action had now arrived, and the appointment of a -ommittee'would afford a pretext to such persons as were not desirous of applying a remedy to the Breat and urgent evils of the present system for standing still, and taking no sneasuzes at aUl. Last year there was a committee of that Elouse, which went very fully into the colonial branch of the question; and he was glad to observe that Sir George Grey, in his speech the other night, stated that the Govern.
ineht had derived considerable advantage from tha information elicited by the committee. As truly stated by the noble earl opposite, the committee of the House of Commons went fully into the question of prison discipline, or the domestic braneh of the subject. Taking both committees together, and not looking at them singly, be thought they affordel an smply sudicient mass of information, and their lordships would only perplex and encumber themselves if, after the investigation of last year, they were to resolve that another inqury was necessary. For these reasons he hoped that the noble marquis would not pre3s his motion. Bbefore he concluded he felt bound to state with how much pleasure he had heard the plan of the Government. He did not of course pledge himself to details; he had not seen the bill, and spoke only from the general outline which had been presented to Parliament; but the measure appeared to him just and wise, framed on sound principles, and likely to afford satisfaction to the colonies and give protection to society at home. One great
dificulty had always been that few persons had been willing I
to look at the question as it affected both the colonies and I the mother country. Chairmen of quarter sessions and I magistrates engaged in the administration of the criminal law were apt to devote their attention exclusively to the home branch, while other persons-for example, the late Sir William Molesworth, whom he mentioned with all respect-confined their attention to the colonies. But no satisfactory measure could be proposed which did not consider both the advantage of the colonies and the protection of the mother country. He thought that the measure of the Government embraced these two objects, and that, while it consulted the wishes and feelings of the colonists, it altered the system which had been so much and so deservedly coinplained of at.home. For these reasons he approved the general principle of the bill; but at the same time he would not deem himself debarred from proposing or supporting any amendment, wshich, upon ful consideration, might appear calculated to render the measure still more effective.
The Earl of CARNABRVON could no' admit that the proposal which the Home Secretary announced the other night was a complete measure.. The speech of the righ hon. gentleman, to judge from the reports of it which had appeared in the newspapers, wanted a comprehensive treatment of the subject. It dealt with the worst class of criminals, who were to be sentenced to somse kind of perpetual imprisonment; with the second class, who were to undergo various periods of penal servitude; and with a class placed between these two; but the great bulk of our criminals-
those who received short sentences-were wholly and entirely untouched. (Hear, hear.) It seemed to him to be an ingenious alteratiox snd shifting of the periods rather than of the nature of punishment. Nor had he succeeded in ascertaining rom the speech what were the intentions of the Government with regard to theticketof-leave system. He should like to know whether it was to be continued as at present, whether the operation of the ticket of leave was to be extended to other countries, or what other changes or modifications the Government designed to introduce. Certain he was that the present system could not continue much longer. It was as bad for the community at large as for the criminal himself ; for the community, because it afforded no security against robbery and violence; and for the criminal, because the so-caUed advantages which it conferred upon him operated to his injury. Re felt no sentimental interest in criminals, but he pitied those unfortunate men, who were made outcasts from society by their own actions, but whom the present state of the law maintained in their degraded condition. By the operation of the existing system they were placed in a position in which they had no alternative between starvation and crime. The 1,600 or 1,700 who were discharged on tickets of leave were but as a drop in the bucket, compared to the 50,000 or 60,000 who were sentenced to various periods of punishment every year. With regard to what had been said by the noble marguis as to the food of prisoners, he must say he was surprised to read in the Western Australian despatches laid on the table last year, that the surgeon attributed disease among the prisoners to excessive food and consequent repletion. (Hear.) He believed that where exception was taken to short sentences it generally applied to juvenile delinquents, for, there could beno doubt that in the case of boys committed toprison, a very short sentence, accompanied with easy prison disipline, took away all the wholesome fear and shamo that should attach to imprisonment. But, in a question of this kind, the great difficulty was to steer clear of excessive lenity on the one hand and excessive severity on the other, and any measure that would meet these extremes and give proper security to the communityat largewould deserve their lordships' support. He hoped that in the settlement of this question due attention would be paid to that most important point, the association and classification of criminals. The existing system was attended with many undoubted evils, and he thought it was worthy of consideration whether or not a mode of classification according to age should not be resorted to. He rejoiced in the prospect ofapartial return to transportation. The old system of transportation, or rather emigration, by wrhich convicts were assigned to the governor of a colony, and by him reassigned as labourers to the colonists, had been attended with the happiest results. (Hear, hear.)
Lord CA&IPBELL begged to say that, with all respect for the noble marquis, he concurred in opinion with the noble earl, who had told them that the time was come for action and not for inquiry. There had been enough of inquiry into this subject; and he regarded the refusal of tho committee by the noble earl (Granville) as a proof of the sincerityof the Government in the steps whichtheyhad 6soe where proposed to take. We were now in a most alarming condition. For the first time in the history of England we had all those who were convicted of crime retained in the country, enduring their punishments, and liable to be let loose to renew their depredations. In former times Xll who were convicted were hanged. That was then the veryeffectual and summary mode of disposing of criminals. In the reign of Henry Vm. about a thousand a-year were hanged. All who were convicted of stealing to the value of 12 pence were at once strung up. This state of things continued till the reign of Elizabeth, when emigration and transportation began, and it then became the practice to send criru-als to Barbadoes or Virginia and to work in the plantations. Daring the reign of the Stuarts, and even down to the beginning of the reign of George m., this system was pur. sued. When we lost the American colonies recourse was had to Botany Bay, and from that time till within three or four years our convicts were sent to the southern hemisphere. But, either by bad luck or mismanagement, we had lost that resource which at one time was our boast and the envy of the whole continent. Transportation was at an end, and on their release convicts had no means of earning an honest penny, and had often no resource but that of returning to their former pursuits. Our condition was now most unsafe. A man going to bed at night had no security that his house would not be broken into before the morning; and there was no safety in going along the streets, as he was liable to be garotted. He was not acquainted with the details of the measure which had been introduced in another place, but unless it provided for the deportation of convicts, of whose reformation there was no reasonable hope in this conntry, he would not give it his support. In his opinion, transportation was the only punishment which afforded a reasonable chance for the reformation of criminals, and he hoped that the Government would direct their attention apecially to the means of continuing that punishment. It was supposed by some persons that the crime which now unfortunately prevailed was attributable to the system of tickets of leave, but he was satisfied that lt arose from the diminution of the punishment of transportation, and that if the issue of tickets of leave were to cease to-morrow there would be little improvement in the condition of the country. His own opinion was that when a conviction took place upon satisfactory evidence, and when the judge thought its duty to pass the most severe sentence allowed by law, although the criminal might turn up his eyes and pretend to be pious and penitent, the punishment ought to be rigidly enforced.
Earl FITZWILLIAM had never heard any speech in that House which was a greater satire upon the legislature of the country than that which had just been deivered by the noble and learned Chief Justice. That noble lord had told them that this country had never been in such a position as that in which it was now placed. ("I Hear, hear," from lord CAMPnBELL.) The noble and learned lord had told them that at the present moment no man could retire to rest at niqht without beinm apprehensive that before morning he might be subjected to some criminal outrage. He would ask whether it was possible fora more fearful state of things to exist than that which had been described by the noble and learned lord ? This country had formerly excited the envy of foreign nations on acrount of its possessing vast colonies beyond the Atlantic which enabled it to dispose of that portion of the population which had become outcasts at home. He must say, however, he did not believe that any system of secondary punshments that could be devised would eradicate crime. They were, in fact, beginning at the wroig end. They must begin, not by punishing men for committing crime, hut by establishing schools and providing such means of education for the people as would teach them to avoid crime; (HIear, hear.) Parliament might en-
deavour to do its duty by acting upon the suggestions which had been made by the Government, but unless they went much further, and endeavoured to provide for the in. struction of that unprotected portion of the community which was ignorant of the value of education, they would do little to meet the exigencies of the case.
Lord DUNGANON did not think such an inquiry as that which was proposed by the noble marquis could all
impede the progress of the measure which had been introduced in the other house. The noble marquis had mentioned some facts which deserved their lordshipse serious attention. He had stated that in some cases the dietary of the poorhouse was by no means so good as that of the gaol. He rLord Dungannon) remembered that some time since a companson was made between the dietary of the county gaol of Flintshire and that of the workhouse of Flint
which showed that the inmates of the gaol certainly had the advantage. The noble marquis had referred to the condition of prisoners when they were discharged after havig undergone confinement on the separate system. Daong
the recess he (Lord Dungannon) visited the convict station at Spike Island, in the county of Cork, aud he was informed that three or four prisoners who had been received there from a prison at Dublin, which was, he believed, conducted
upon a system similar to that adopted at Pentonville, were in such a condition that they were unfitted for any sort of
employment for a considerable length of time. The nature of the punishment they had undergone had utterly sus-
pended, and indeed almost destroyed, their powers of mind. gurely, punishment was never intended to affect the health of criminals to such an extent as to render them useless members of society. The noble earl who last spoke had said they were beginning at the wrong end, and had urged
the importance of imbuing the minds of the riing genera toa with such principles as would restrain them from the comnmisson of crime; but he (Lord Dangannon) would ask whether there ever was a period in the hiatory of this country when greater attention was paid to the education of
the community than at the present timne? (Flear, hear.) He was convinced that there were verv few persons desirous of receiving instruction who were unable to obtain it. (Hear, hear.) He bad heard with great satiLaction the statement of the Lord Chief Justice that he would opposo the bill whichwas now before the other Fonse if provision vwere notina defor the deportationof aUl incorrigible criminals. With regard to the system of tickets of leave, he also concurred in the suggestion of the noble uuar(qui,, that one of the conditions upon vhich such tickets were granted should he that the recipients should not SÃ¯Â¿Â½ within 100 miles of the places where their crimes had been committed, becauise, when convicts returned to the scene of their wicked exploits, they were almost forced, by the impossibility of o taining employment, to resume their former prsuits, andi they frequently seduced the Toung and inexperienced to follow their bad example. 'Withont any reference tothe question whether the repentance of those men was sincere or not, the public safety demanded that the experiment should be made tlsewbere than in this country. He was sorry to find that the bill introduced by the Government in the other house did not contain ay provision in reference to tickets of leave, but he hoped that before it came up to their lordships that omission would be remedied.
Lord RAVENSWORTEE (who had a motion on the paper relative to the employment of convict labour in the forma. tion of a harbour refuge on the north-east coast) said, he was disappointed to learn that the Government had not made any provision in the bill introduced by the Home Secretary for the employment of convict labour on useful public works in this country. For instance, the necessity of a harbour of refuge on the north-east coast for the protection of shipping and commerce had been very strenuously urged upon the Government, and on such a work as this convicts mightbe employedwithgreatbenefit to the country. The wrecks on this coast were very numerous, and not very long ago property to the amount of 100,0001. had been lost upon it in the short space of three days, and many lives. Lord wensleydale, in a letter he had written on secondary punishments, suggested that if a great mass of convicts were to remain in this country from time to time it was highly expedient to establish a certain number of depots throughout England, where they might be advantageously employed in various kinds of public works, and for some time removed from the evil influence of their old haunts and associates. Any establishment of that nature would, of course, he laced under proper organization, and might also be maue subservient to the ultimate interests of the convict himself by some provision under which he might husband a portion of his earnings against the time when bus sentence would expire. The only objection he had heard to such a proposal was that of the expense; but, he would ask, ought the question of expense to weigh with a great commercial country hke this when the objec's to be gained were of such vast importance ? In a time of war we thought nothing of pouring milions of treasure into that great gulf which absorbed the resources and the bone and sinew of the country to such an enormous extent; and was it reasonable that such a suggestion as he (Lord Ravensworth) was now making should be iet with a mere question of pounds, shillings, and pence? A mere mnodicum of the sums that had recently been expended for purposes of war would be sufficient to provide harbours of refuge wherever they might be required throughout the country. Agai, the large sum paid in tolls and dues by the commercial marine of tho country gave it an additional right to the protection to be derived from harbours of refuge. Was there, too, no unreasonable expenditure in the maintenance of our convicts in a state of idleness? From a report of Colonel Jebb it appeared that the annual cost of maintaining each prisoner at Miltiank was 231. Is. 10d.; at Pentonville, 241. 12s.; and at Dartmoor, 30Z. 4s. ld. At Portland, on the other hand, where the convicts wero employed on public works, and where the value of their labour was taken into account, the annual cost of maintaining each prisoner was only 2i. 17s., and at Portsmouth, where the convicts were also employed on public works, the annual cost of maintenance per man was 4Z. 16s. When their lordshiPs looked at that estimate of the cost of keeping convicts employed, as compared with those who were unemployed, and when they had regard also to the enormons loss of property in shipping, from time to time, by disasters at sea, he thought the inference went irresistibly to support the suggestions he had made to tbe House. Again, let their l ordships look at the state of the workhouses in England and Wales, where at this moment there were 51,586 children of both sexes, of whom 6,000 were fit for public service. That was a serious consideration, and another reason, as he thought, why the Government in a time of peace, with the whole resources of the country at their command, should direct their attention to providing such facilities as he had ventured to suggest for the greater protection of the shipping of the country and of the lives of men engagesl in seafaring pursuits. He might also remind their loriships tbat, while there were no less than three or four different harbours of refuge on the south coast of England, there was not a single one throughout the whole 260 miles of iron-bound coast on the north-east. (Hear.) He thought, when the question of how our convict population was to be dealt with was under consideration, it was a perfectly legitimate opportunity for him to make the suggestions he had done, and he trusted they would meet with such
ttention as they fairly deserved at the hands of the Government.
Lord STANLEY of ALDERLEY reminded the Honse that convict labour was already employed at Portland, and with, he believed, advantageous results; but it entailed a certain amount of expenditure in establishment charges, which would make it difficult to be applied in all cases where it might be desirable to have recourse to it. He acknowvledged the desirability of establishing harbonrs of refuge in which vessels in distress might take shelter, but while admitting this he could not allowv that the north-east coast could prefer any claim which was no' common to other parts of England. He would also remind his noble friend that the Government had been largely engaged in the construction of works of this description. When he mentioned Portland harbour, Dover harbour, and the harbour of Alderney, all of which were not only extremely useful and beneficial for purposes of commerce, but had been strongly urged upon the attention of Government as apro-
ate spots for ercting defences, the noble lord wouldprosablysdmitthattheseoplacesh a priority of claim. Another harbour was also in progress at Holybead, and one was also very much demanded to establish better means of intercourse between Scotland and Ireland. Moreover, of all the great seaports of England, those connected with the Tyne had excepting Liverzool, the least ground to come before iarliament and ask for a harbour of refuge. These ports had for years past levied large contributions upon all the shipping which had frequented the Tyne, a large portion of which contributions had been devoted by Newcastle to municipal purposes, in lighting the town and soon, wvhereas, if spent in improving the navigation and for the benefit of the dripping, the money would have established 20 arbours of refuge in that part of the country. ("Oh !" and a laugh.) He was very far from denying the importance of establishing harbours of refuge, but it was extremely difficult to decide between the conflicting claims put forth by different parts of the kingdom. He hardly new a single Tint of the coast, from the HIumber up to the Firth of Fort , which had not put in its claim to the construction there of such a harbour. Now, he did not means to assert that the existence of this difference of opinion as to the best position for a harbour of refuge ought to prevent the Government from devoting their attention to the subject. At the present moment, however, he was not prepared to recommend the commencement of any new work of this description, though he admitted that the whole question-not as to the establishment of harbours of refuge on the part of the coast pointed out by the noble lord, but throughout the whole coast of England-wa4well worthy the consideration of the Government.
Lord VIVIAN thought there was no question of more importance thau this, and none to which the attention of the Government ought to be more directed, or with regard to which grants of public money might more properly be voted.
The motion for the appointment of a Select Committee on Secondary Punishments was then negatived.
REPRESENTATIVE PEERS.
The Earl of LUCAN asked whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to take any steps to give effect to the recommendations of the Lords' Select Committee, appointed in the session of 1856, to inquire into the expenses incurred by Scotch and Irish peers in proving their right to vote for representative peers?
Earl GRANVILLE replied that it was the intention of Government to bring in a bill to give effect to the recommendations of the committee referred to.
STAITUTE LAW COM7IIISSION.
The Seloct Committee on the Second Report of the Statute Law Commission was named and appointed.

"ut CHARITABLE TRUSTS. Mr. MOWBRAY asked the Chancellor of the Duchv of Lancaster whether it was the intention of the Government to bring in any bill to amend the act of 1853 for the bett"r administration of charitable trusts ? And, also whether they intended to reintroduce the bilk for giving'leeislative sanction to various schemes of the Charity Comm£siOIleri which the Government abandoned last session? Mr. BAINES replied that it was not intended to alter the Charitable Trusts Act this session. With respect to the second question of the hon. and learned member, a bUl was prepared which would be introduced before Easter. THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION.' Sir S. NORTHCOTE inquired when the next report o£ the Civil Service Commissioners would be presented ? Mr. WILSON said the report was quite ready and would, he believed, be presented to-morrow. POSTAL COMMUNICATION WITH IRELAND. In reply to Mr. Groqan, . y&kfi1^?? *$?' * c.o,mmittee of the House which sat in 1853 had taken the evidence of a number of gentlemen m whoso judgment, accuracy, and discretion the House could not fail to? place reliance, but when that evidence cameto bo tested by endeavours to act practically upon it the Government found that the views expressed by those witnesses hadbeen exaggerated, and that it would be most difficult to come to any arrangement based upon them. It would be no improvement in the communication asregarded either letters or passengers, unless the former leaving London ? the morning should proceed to the province of Ireland the same evening, and those leaving London in tbe evening should be sent into the provinces the next momi*. Jlhe period of time in which the transit was to be made «aj very limited, but, according to the views of the witnesses before the committee, there was no difficulty in accomplishing it. The Government had been disappointed in their expectabons of being able to carry out the views of the witnesses before the committee, but considerable modification had been introduced into their plans, and they were in hopes that the desired object would be speedily accom. plished. Asfar as the Post-office authorities were concerned. they had shown tho utmost anxiety to have their arraneewf xStllÌ?UÌÌ Th° rtUT'y "£ «tea^Paoket compare had displayed the greatest readiness to assist, and the Government were prepared to pay liberally for the services required. He hoped under these circumstances, that in k few days he should be able to announce that some modified plan which would secure all the objects he had stated had Deen adopted. BANKRUPT BANKING COMPANIES. ? Jkj ?YTL?R,asked the Attorney-General whether ho intended to introduce ??? measure to facUitate the winding up o£ bankrupt banking companies, to render speedy assistance to creditors, and to prevent the serious expense and loss to creditors and shareholders which existed under the present condition of the law ; also, whether it would be the object of any measure he might inboduce upon the subject to prevent the conflicting jurisdictions of the Courts of Çhanceiy and Bankruptcy so as to render the law cheap, simple, and adapted for its purpose ? t The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said that, in order to answer the questions, it was necessary to remind tho House that by an act passed in the last session of Parliament all incorporated companies, present and future, with the exception of banking and insurance companies, had been subjected to rules for tho purpose of winding up ru the event of their insolvency or bankruptoyT which, he believed, would be found quite effectual foi that object, and which rules, if capable of being acted upon in the case of the Royal British Bank, would have prevented the gross scandal to English jurisprudence exhibited by the proceedings in reference to that matter. Uther banking companies weie subjected to the Winding-up Acts which did not contain the useful provisions to be found ? the act of last session-provisions which would have prevented tho conflict of jurisdictions and enabled payment of the debts of the bank to be made without the grievous oppression of eveiy shareholder being exposed to actions at the suit of eveiy creditor. The House would recollect that in the last session a biU containing excellent provisions was brought in for the purpose of facilitating arrangements between shareholders and creditors of jointstock companies in case of bankruptcy. This House, however, after it had come down from the House, of Lords, refused to pass that ??. It was his intention to consider whether the provisions in the act of last session, together with the provisions of that ?? might not be brought into one ??, forthe purpose of bein» made avaUable to bankrupt banking and insurance companies ; and, if the Lord ChanceUor, under whose consideration the subject was, had no better plan, and that plan should receive the sanction of the Government, to bring in a bill for the purpose in the course of the present session. (Hear, hear.) HOSTILITIES WITH CHINA. Mr. COBDEN gave nobce that on this day fortnight he would move the two foUowing resolutions :-" 1. That this House has heard with concern of the conflicts which have occurred between the British and Chinese authorities on the Canton river, and, without expressing any opinion how far the Government of China afforded cause of complaint by non-fulfilment of the treaty of 1842, considers that the papers laid on the table f aü to establish satisfactory grounds for tho violent proceedings resorted to with respect to the case of the Arrow. 2. That ? select committee be appointed to inquire into the state of our commercial relations with China." CAPITAL PUNISHMENTS. Mr. W. EWART gave notice that, on the 26th inst., he would move for leave to inboduce a bül to assimilate thellaw affecting capital punishments in Scotland with the law in England. THE ARMY. Colonol LINDSAY gave notice that, on the 26th inst., he would move that a humble address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that she will be graciously pleased to take Into consideration the injury inflicted on those lieutenantcolonels of the army who attained that rank before the 20th of June, 1854, and who have bean superseded by the retrospective action ofthe warrant of the 6th of October, 1854. THE NELSON COLUMN. Mr. WARREN asked the First Commissioner of Works whether any and what steps remained to be taken by Her Majesty, s Government to complete the monument to Lord Nelson in Trafalgar-square; and, if so, when the complebon might be expeoted ? Sir B. HALL said, the erection of the Nelson column was not originally undertaken by the Government. About the year 1840 some naval officers opened a public subscripbon for the purpose, and in May, 1844, a sum of 20,00(M. having been collected, SirG. Cockburn addressed a letter to the Treasury, in which he stated that a further sum of L¡,000í. would be required to complete the monument. Upon a revision of the estimate it was stated thatthe «doitional sum would be 14,S05i., and between 184o and 1850 a sum of 14,800í. was voted by Parliament for the completion of the works. But the estimates were found to be entirely incorrect; and, although 15,464í. had been expended since the monument had been handed over to the Board of Works, he had reason to believe that 4.00UÎ. or õ.OOOJ. more would be required to complete it according to the design of the original promoters. If Parliament would vote the money the works should be carried out with the utmost expedition, but it was not thought desirable this year to ask for a further advance in reference to this matter. (Hear.) CONVICT SETTLEMENTS. Mr. LIDDELL asked for information in reference to the penal settlement situated upon the Massarooni River in üntísh Guiana,-first, when it was established; secondly, whether for Imperial or colonial purposes; thirdly, whether it was still in use ; if not, what causes had led to its abandonment ? . Mr. LABOUCHERE said the settlement was established ? I04.I for purely colonial purposes, and, so far from being abandoned, was m active and useful operation. It was under considerabon whether it should not be made avaUable for the reception of convicts from other parts of the West SIR R. PEEL'S LECTURE. Mr. STAFFORD-I rise to ask tho hon. 'baronet tho member for Tarnworth whether the report of a «peeoh of his (mado onthe 7th of January, atSaltby, near Birmingham), which appeared in The Times newspaper, be correct, especially those passages which refer to the Grand Duke Constantine of Russia, M. de Moray, and the Prince de Ligne? Sir R. PEEL.-My hon. friend has asked me a quesbon and I hope the House will aUow me to say a few words in' explanation. (Hear, hear.) It is said that it has been arranged»-andthewordisaheavyone-to put a quesbon to me whether a speech reported to have been delivered by me at Saltby, and reported in The Times of the 7th ?'i l°°St! ,?0"·l d0 not think> Perhaps, that thisi, quite the tribunal ? wbch I ought to bo called to account for expressions used in another place, and totally un00n. neoted with the business of this House. (Hear, hear) Afc the same time, I am quite ready to accept the challenge of the hon. gentleman, and I am quite prepared to give him every facility in obtaining tho most accurate information on this most importantsubjeot. (A laugh.) Thehon, gentleman asks me whether I delivered the speech at Saltby which an pearedmmR^IbegtosaythatldiddeUverthatspeech as the guest of the hon. member for Adderley (laughterVfor North Staffordshire. He invited me to attend that meeting on the occasion of a joUification (laughter), and I addressed that meeting. I admit that I am not in thehabit of reading reports of speeches of mine after they are delivered. I generaUy rest satisfied with the favourable impression that I produce at the time. (LaughteM It ig therefore, rather difficult forme at this distance ?? time to pledge myself to the exact accuracy of every word that an pearsinthatreport. (Hear.) I beUeve I spoke for nearly two hours and ?-half without notes, so that it is rather clifiioult for me to say whether thatreport is precisely correct (Hear íí¿ B,uUh^sI am Prepared to say, that such is the' ability, tho acknowledged ability, and impartiality with wbch the leading journal reports the proceedings of public meetings that I am quite prepared to accept the entire responsibility of every single sentence, except a particulaphrase, which I do not think I used, but which if I had used I should have been equaUy prepared to accept the entire responsibility of. But I am sure that the
Eouse, as a great deal has been said about this speech, wiU »ve me 10 minutes for a few remarks on it. (Hear.) I ShaU be very glad indeed to offer some explanabon, as my phrates have been tortured a good deal from their true meaning, and a meaning has been given to them that I never intended to convey. I did address the meeting at Saltby, and, as a great deal of comment has been made on my words, it will perhaps be right, as I occupy a public situation, to put them in their true and proper light. <Hear.) I am very sorry, and I do regret that any inconvenience should have arisen from any expressions that may have fallen from me, and which have been misinterpreted on that occasion. It is very far from my wish, and I think I may say from my nature-and I am known to many members of this House-to cause unnecessary pain to any one· (General cheering.) But these sentences have been very greatly twisted ; and, first, with reference to the Count de Momy, the Grand Duke Constantine, and the Prince de Ligne. (Hear. ) As regards the Count de Moray, I absolutely repudiate having said anything about him which might not have been said by any gentleman with reference to his friends or acquaintances. (Muoh laughter.) I said that he was U plus arand spéculateur de VEurope. (Cheers and laughter.) Now, I did not intend to imply anything detrimental to his honourable character (continued laughter) ; and immediately on my arrival in town, when I heard that these expressions had been noticed, I wrote to Count de Moray to say that certainly envy and malice had done their best to twist these expressions of mine into something odious to him, bnt that I repudiated saying a single word against his character or the position he oooupied. Now, I could not say more. ICheers.) As regards the Grand Duke Constantine, that is another matter. I certainly said that the Grand Duke Constantine did not quite impress me with the feeling o£ a "frank and open-hearted saUor." (A laugh.) I sæd that ; but the words were not mine ; they were used by the gaUant admiral sitting there (pointing to Sir Charles Napier, amid much laughter). I never said one word against the Grand Duke Constantine, or any othor member of the Royal family of lhat country. On the contrary, when I said that he did not give me the impression of being " a frank and openhearted sailor," I meant that he gave me the impression of being a man of great powers of mind. (Roars of laughter.) ?What I intended to convey was, that he was not merely a simple saUor (continued laughter), but a man of greater grasp of mind. (Great laughter, in which Sir ? Napier heartUy joined.) As regards the Prince de Ligne, I accept the responsibUity of every phrase that I used. I certainly did say-and I should be sorry to cause any unnecessary pain to any one-but I was talking in a familiar way, and I did use the expression that he was " as stiff and starched as the frill of Queen Elizabeth." (A laugh.) I cannotaccept the responsibility of every word in the report. I see my hon friend opposite (Mr. Adderley) who was present, and Lord Lyttelton was also present, and I appeal to him to say whether a single word fell from my lips that might not have found an echo and expression from the most straightlaced gentleman in this house (laughter). All loan say is that ;f, in the opinion of the hon. gentlemen who may have considered this question,-if in the attempt, the innocent attempt, I made to paint a few light and airy sketches of character (laughter), to, as Pepe said, "hold the mirror up to nature" (continued laughter), to " catch the manners living ?? they rise" (much laughter)-if I have erred in the good opinion of those whose good opinion I honour and valueand whose judgment has weight, I beg to say, on this public occasion, as an earnest of the sincerity of my feelings, that, though I do not feel that I did err, still, if I did err in their opinion, I now offer the most ample expression of regret (cheers), and that is the most fitting amende lionoraUe that I can offer. (Cheering from all side* of the House.) THE " SECRET TREATY." Lord PALMERSTON.-I wish to set myself right with the right hon. gentleman opposite with regard to an assertion I made on Tuesday night with respect to the military convention to which I referred. I said that I had been informed that that convention had not been signed, and my belief was that it had not been signed. But I think it right to state that, on further inquiry, I find that in point of fact it was signed (loud cheers from tho Opposition benches), but tbat, being in its nature more of a mUitary than a political convention, and having for its object the regulation, the mutual regulation, of the French and Austrian troops which might be in Italy ia the contingency of Austria declaring war against Russia, and, Austria never having declared war against Russia, that convention, although signed, became a dead letter, and never had any application or effect whatsover. Mr. DISRAELI.-Although there is no question bsfore the House, yet I hope I shall be allowed to make a few remarks, and they shall be of extreme brevity. The House will recoUect that I mentioned on the first night of the session that there was a secret treaty between France and Austria. That statement received a direot contradiction from the noble lord. ( ·« No ! " fr'om Lord Palmerston ) It was_ "a romance." (Opposition cheers.) The noble lord said I was distinguished for my powers of imagination, that this was a complete inveution, that I had produced somo works of imagination, and that this was another "romance." (Cheers.) A week elapsed and I took the earliest opportunity of the noble lord's reappearance in the house to make a statement which I hope from a sense of justice, is still in the recollection of tho House. I stated that what I had said on a previous occasion was perfectly correct-that there was a treaty between France and Austria, and that the object of that treaty was to guarantee the security of the Italian provinces of Austria. I said that that treaty was signed (Opposition cheers)-that it was acted on, that it was indeed extensively acted on, for the troops of Austria were withdrawn from Italy in cuiiáequonce of that treaty ; that at a subsequent period alarm was felt by the Italian Governments at the withdrawal of thos.: troops, and that they requested the permission of Austria to communicate in con fidence the existence of th, treaty m order to tranquillize their subjects. This was the treaty we wore told was never acted upon. (Uhtuf.) What was the answer I received on the second occasion? The noble lord declared on the fir^t »ocasión that it was a romance. He was cheu, a; tur thu ¿«nails I gave, obliged to own that there was a written doou.uent in existence, the object of vhich was t. ?????.?? that which I explained. The noble lord said it was not a treaty but ? convention. But, said the roble lord, " That convention was ????? signed. (Cheer,.) I have h.T in active communi cation with those who can give me tho best information on the subject. I have received information, and the fact is that the affair never wis in operation, and so I was justiued in my statement that there was nothing of the kind, and that the whole thing was aromânce." Now comes thé third act. We now havo au acknowledgment from the noble lord, not merely that there is a written document in existence in the ubai* of a, convention between these two Powers for the object I btated, and that it is a secret document, but that tho only statement which the other night saved the noblo iord from turttantial refutation,-namely, that the convention was not Mjçneii,- is incorrect, and that the convention was dgned. (Hear, hear.) After these two ¡.¿missions from the noble lord 1 stana here to state again that whioh I stated on tho first night of the session. I°say it was not a convention, it was a treaty ; I say it was not only »igned, but extensível·.· acted upon ; I say that every expression the noble lord usod in describing that instrument ¡? little applies to its rèi! nature, >.s it has been represented to me, lhat I reaily behoved at the end of the debate tha other night that there ??-t h---e benn some mili. tary convention in e-i-teiic/·, founded upon the treaty, which had not been -\¿n-A, a.,d '!.*t the u.-ble lord was entirely misleading 51·« Hous,:. iC!.eers.) I state again that there is a treaty ? i. seerat, treaty-between Franc,, and Austria, theobjectof which if to guarantee the security of the Italian possessions of Austria-that it was executed on the day I mentioned-that it has been extensively acted upon-that to the best of my belief it contains, on its surface, no limitation of the period of its operation-and that the character given of it by the nohí,- lord the other ni»ht ? entirely incorrect. (Loud cheery.) Lord PALMER3T<V,-._I have n0 right fco ? ^ upontheindu'genceof the House, but I hope I sliaU be allowed to say a few words after the observations of the right hon. gentleman, l,y which he attempts to cover his ignominious retreat from his first position. (Ironical cheers from the Opposition, and counter cheers.) The right hon. gentleman has misstated what he said on a former occasion. (Cheers and counter cheers.) Ho has entirely misrepresented his own expressions-Ms own statement. What was the right hon. gentleman's statement ? His statement was that there was a treaty between Austria and France for guaranteeing the Italian possessions of Austria (hear, hear)-that it was now in existence-that it had been recently quoted by Austria in consequence of the discussions between France and England on the one hand and Naples on the «ther-and that it had been executed at the instiga tion of Æe English Government (loud cries of "Oh, oh" and cheers) ; that it had been executed not only with the knowledge, but at the instigation of Her Majesty's Government. (Continued cheers and counter cheers.) Mr. DISRAELI.-At the " instance 1" Lord PALMERSTON.-No, "instigation"! But the right hon. gentlemsn cannot rest his statement upon syllables However, I heard tbe word and I recollect it. lam sure he made use of the word " instigation." Mr. DISRAELI.-"Instance " or " advice !" Lord PALMERSTON,-Well, advice ! (Cheors from the
Opposition.) Oh ! but I heard the word " instigation " distinctly. (Renewed cheers and counter cheers.) Mr. DISRAELI.-You say it is instigation. Lord PALMERSTON.-What the right hon. gentleman meant was that the treaty originated in advice and counsel given by the English Government to the Governments of France and Austria. I denied the whole of that statement at the time it was made, and the whole of that statement I again deny. To the best of my knowledge and belief no such treaty exists or ever was executed. I state most distinctly that the British Government has no knowledge of such a treaty, and therefore cannot have instigated it. I said the other night that if the right hon. gentleman had seen such a treaty, and could assert its existence on his own knowledge, of course I would bow to his assertion, and although I knew nothing of it I wonld take for granted that it did exist. I also said that a convention of a totally different kind had been negotiated,-a convention regulating the mode of action of the French and Italian troops which might happen to be in Italy at the time, in the event of Austria declaring war against Russia and fighting in concert with England and France, as Austria naturally wished her rear to be secured while she was fighting in the van in concert with the allies. I said that convenbon was founded upon the assumed case of a deciarabon of war by Austria against Russia, and such a declarabon never having taken place the convention became a dead letter, and, whether signed or not, had no effect and never could take effect. These assertions I sffil maintain, and therefore I say the right lion, gentleman, notwithstanding the vapouring manner in which he has been pleased to follow up his statement (loud cries of "Oh !" from the Opposition, and cheers from the Ministerial benohes), has been imposed upon. (Continued cries of "Oh !" and cheers.) I beg your pardon ! the right hon. gentleman used hard words, and I shall ex" press my opinion, whatever he may think of my mode of expression. (Cheers.) I say, then, that the right hon. gentleman has, to the best of my belief, been grossly imposed upon ; that a military convention, which never came into operation, because that which was to have been the basis and foundation of it never took place, has been represented to him as being that which it never was and was never intended to be, as a permanent guarantee of the Italian possessions of Austria by France-I say that it is utterly impossible that the military convention could have been made use of in the manner he described, because Austria could not have said to Naples, "I have a permanent guarantee from France for my Italian possessions," seeing that the only thing signed, as far as I am aware, was a convention providing for a case which never had any existence, and that the military convenbon I have described was not signed at our instigation or by our advice, but was communicated to us as an arrangement already settled between France and Austria ; and the only quesbon with us was whether, on the whole, France was bound in honour to make such arrangements as would render the posi. tion of the Austrian armies in Italy secure. So far, therefore, from that which I have stated bearing out the statement of the right hon. gentleman, it shows that my own statement was perfectly true, and that the right hon. gentleman is entirely misinformed as to the facts of the case. (Loud cheers and counter cheers.) DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC JUSTICE. Mr. NAPIER then rose to move that a humble address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that she will be graciously pleased to take into consideration, as an urgent measure of administrative reform, the formation of a separate andresponsiblo department for the affairs of publicjusbce. The improvement he had suggested was, he said, required by public opinion ; it was supported when it was proposed on a former occasion by the noble lord the member for London, and he hoped that the Government would now think it consistent with their duty to accede to his proposition- The right hon. and learned gentleman then proceeded in a very indistinct tone to advert to various propositions on the subject which had been made m Parliament up to the present bme. If the duties of the Legislature were properly discharged the number of our laws would be diminished rather than increased, because as the nation advanced in civilization, and the principles of religion became more deeply and widely felt, the duties of social life would be better understood, and there would be less necessity for the interference of the Legislature. Lord Hardwicke, in the debate on the Militia Bill iu 175G, strongly denounced the accumulation of statutes upon statutes, which produced little else but confusion ; and he said that a multitude of useless statutes was one of the greatest plagues that could bo inflicted on a nation. Our laws should not only be framed but administered according to ? well defined system. And to that end it was neceesary that the mode of appointing the judges should be uniform in every part of the united kingdom, whereas in England a certain number of them were appointed by the Crown, and another by the Lord Chancellor, while in Ireland and Scotland the judges were appointed by departments of the btate. He believed 'hat it was a most perilous matter to oppose the demand of the people for a thorough reform in the administration of justice. The reform required by them was just and reasonable, and they would insist on having it. If it were not conceded prudently and progressively they would, at some time or otht-r, obtain it violently ; and then the sound and the unsound parvs of our laws would be dragged down together. All reforms were at first met by a dogged and sullen resistance, but this only stimulated the advocates of reform to greater earnestness. The feudalism of our laws was dying rapidly away, as was also that narrow precision that used to be in so much favour a few years ago. This, then, was a most appropriate time for the introduction of an improved system of making and administering our laws. Every enlightened ¡nan who had paid attention to this subject approved the introduction of some central supervision over the administration of public justice. There ought to be some person oF competent authority who could communicate with those who had to administer the laws, with the view of ascertaining from buie to time what difficulties they experienced in their administration, and who could receive suggestions froni the publio for the improvement of the law. During ¡us Parliamentary career (and he was sure that such was the experience of every other hon. memberfbe had received many communications suggestive of excellent remedies for the inconveniences connected with the workto"· of the law. But what was to be done with these suggestions? To whom was he to go if he wished to have practical effect given to those wise suggestions ? There was no department of justice that had the means of remedying legal grievances ; and that itself was a great grievance. We had a Minister of War, a Board of Trade a Board of Health, and a Board of Education. We found that the business connected with these several departments was better transacted by concentrating thejattenbon of those employed therein to one special branch of the public affairs, and by attaching direct responsibility to the heads of those departments. The country was well satisfied with the results of that division of the public departments. it we had such a department for the conduct and charge of legislation we should then, and then only, have a properlv organized machinery for that purpose. It was not only in recent times that this subject had excited attention, for ? ? ? vCon su?gest«d thafc commissioners should be appointed by both Houses to keep an eye upon the working of the law. Lord Langdale in ?6 spoke in frvour of the appointment of a Minister who should communicate with the junges and other officers engaged in the administration of the law, should receive their advice, and should require that proper bills should be properly prepared. It was often made a ground of complaint against the Lord Chancellor that he did so little for law reform. He (Mr. Napier) thought that these complaints were unjust, and, considering the Rreat amount of judicial and other business which he had to tiansact, he was only surprised that that noble lord, whom be had ever f "und to be exceedingly courteous and most anxious to promote sound and well-considered reforms ef the law, had time to do so much as he did. (Hear, hear 1 In a letter addressed by him in 1845 to the right hon baronet opposite (Sir J. Graham) Lord Brougham expressed his opinion that legislation in the matter of the reform of the law was capricious and uncertain, because we had no Minister of Justice, no great functionary who should consider and mature the necessary changes; and in the very last speech which he made in the House ot Lords Lord Langdale referred to the extension of the local jurisdiction of County Courts as an additional reason *hy the Government and the Legislature snould give their attention to this matter of simplifying arid improving the law, and bringing it into harmony with the common sense of the country. After he (Mr. Napier) called attention to the subject in the year 1855, there appeared in The Times newspaper an able and powerful article, in which the opinion was expressed that the appointment of a Minister of Justice was necessary to the commencement of a satisfactory and consistent reform of the law. Fortified by these authorities, and by the opinion of the noble lord the member for the city of London (Lord J. Russell), he hoped he should not be thought presumptuous in again calling the attention of the House to this subject. At present we were in a transition state ; the law was declining in public respect, and it was only by carrying out legal education in accordance with great and sound principles, and having onr old law reconstructed, and our new laws framed upon those principles, that we could have justice adminstered with credit and satisfaction to the country. It was gratifying to observe that on both sides of the House there was one common desire for the advancement of social, moral, and legal reform. It had been well said that England had the choice of two careers before her-the first, that of constant intermeddling with and domineering over the continent of Europe ; the second, the promobon of important domestic reforms ; and that by the second of these careers this country would ??? fulfil the great mission assigned to her by Stilton-namely, " teaching the nations how to live." We had now escaped alike from the preoccupation and the burdens of war, and the task of improving the administration of our laws-pre-eminently a work of peace -had an urgent claim on our attention, and the moderate expense incident to its adequate execution would be cheerfully contributed by the community. It was said, however, that the creation of a distinct department of public justice, such as he proposed, would interfere with the Lord Chancellor. This reminded him of the saying of a witty Chief Baron in Ireland, who remarked that Samson was a strong man and Solomon a wise one, but neither of them could pay rent if they had'nt the money." (Laughter.) So with the Lord Chancellor ; his power for work might be great, yet he could not do everything. With the multiplicity of other engagements pressing upon him, it was impossibleto expect thatnoble and learned lord to bestow the time and attention needed to bring our lawinto a proper state ; and the Government themselves acknowledged this by their recommendation of the appointment either of a board or a single officer, with a staff of assistants, to perform thisimportaatduty. The objecbon that his plan would interfere with the Secretary of State for the Home Depart-
ment was deserving of a little weight. Surely tt would be no interference with that Minister which could iusby be complained of if the task of maturing the measures to be brought before Parliament, which was now either not discharged at ill or discharged but very imperfectly, were, by a proper division of labour, intrusted to hands that could accomplish it. Again, as to interfering with the Irish exeoubve, he could only say that he wanted to interfere with that executive. (.'Hear," and alau«h.) No country could profit more than Ireland would from her laws, rn common with those of the rest of the united kingdom, bemg subjected to the efficient supervision of a responsible and rightly constituted centoal authority. The argument that such a department would interfere with the freedom of Parliament was equally untenable, because the proposed functionary would havo to attend in his place in Parliament, to explain to it all matters relabeg to his measures, and submit them to its final decision and control· The difficulties m the way of the execution of this reform might indeed be great, but they were by no means insuperable, and if honesüy and boldly grappled with they must speedily vanish. He hoped to have the support of the Government and the House to a proposal so fraught with benefit to the coun*?\ , .The Maister had already admitted the necessity of talang steps for the progressive improvement of the law, and it was earnestly to be desired that no long time should elapse ere the education ofthe legal profession, the appointment of our judges, the process of framing our statutes, and the admimstrabon of justice throughout this gTeat empire were placed on a solid, satisfactory, and enlightened basis. The laws of a country with free insbtubons ought surely to reflect the mind and spirit of the people. A casual, a paltry repair, a clumsy addition, was not the reform which was now reasonably demanded. We had seen the light and were afraid, but we had not heard the voice. Should we go on year after year accumulating inconsistency and confusion, or by a rational effort fairly meet the exigencies of the claim now made on a reformed Parliament 1 We should regard our laws and institutions as typified by that bee which was said most to resemble the tree of life, the branches of which bent to earth again and formedits second roots-the green and living branch, but not the blighted bough. (Hear.) The right] hon. and learned gentlemra (who was very indistinctly heard throughout) then concluded by moving as above. Mr. COLLIER seconded the motion, and expressed his fears lest the House and the country should be getting tired of hearing about law reforms. So much was said about law reforms each session.and so Uttle done,that the public might be excused for believing there was an understanding among the lawyers to talk but not to act upon the subject. He however, believed that the country took a great interest in the matter, and did not look with satisfaction upon the present state of our tribunals and of our laws. Indeed, it could not be otherwise when the courts of law and of equity dealt with the same matters on totally distinct principles, and that again in the ecclesiastical courts a third set of princlples was acted upon. No one could have regarded with satisfaction the recent fight of the Courts of Chancery and Bankruptcy over the dead body of the British Bank. If they looked to the highest tribunals they found two supreme co-ordinate courts, one of which, the Committee of the Pnvy Council, performed its functions to the satisfaction of all parties, while the other, the appellate tribunal of the House of Lords, gave equal dissatisfaction. Nor was the state of the law more satisfactory than the state of the tribunals. The statate book was still a rude undigested mass, which had defied all the attempts at consolidation from the days of Bacon to Mr. Bellenden Ker. The country wished for a removal of the obstacles to the transfer of land, and it also objected to the law governing the relations between husband and wife which were disgraceful to any civilized country. There were complaints respecting the ecclesiastical law, and the tteroantile lawsof England and Scotland were materially different, no attempt being made to harmonize them. What had been the attempts to remedy those defects ? Commissions were appointed to whom the various matters were committed in a vague manner which involved a fruitless result. Those commissions were composed of men with different opinions, who soon came to a dead-lock, and each member made his own report. As a rule, commissions were abortive. There hadbeen, nodoubt, somelawreforms, bntthey were made to meet the exigency of the moment without any comprehensive view of the law as a whole. He did not mean to impute blame to any one. Every year there was a magnificent programme of law reforms announced by the Government. There were about half-a-dozen field-days for the lawyers, whomadeperhapslonger speeches than the House cared to hear. The subject having been ventilated, the measures were postponed from day to day, and finally laid on the shelf. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord at the head of the Government did not regard such questions with such fervour as he did those which might involve the stability of his Administration. He feared that the present session was not likely to be more fruitful of results in the way of law reforms than its predecessors. The hon. and learned gentleman (the Attorney-General) had sketched out in his address to tas constituents at Aylesbury a masterly programme which unfortunately he had not been able to carry out. Thé registry of landed property was an abortive scheme, as was also the amendment of the ecclesiasbcal law, for the measure propounded by tho Lord Chancellor was not one that that House would entertain fora moment. (Hear ) It was right, however, to say that he believed his hon. and learned fnend, the Attorney-General, who was a sincere law reformer, had never been in favour of a transference of the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts to the Courts of Chancery. The only measures to be expected this session w rethose which the Lord ChanceUor had announced a few evenings since. He did not cast blame upon the law officers of the Crown, for he beUeved the Lord ChanceUor, with his duties in Chancery, could not fulfil the duties of á munster of justice, such as it was the desire of the light hon and learned gentleman (Mr. Nanier) to see created At present it would be impossible for the Lord ChanceUor to be at the head of a department of justice, because he had no staff to assist him. It was equally impossible that the duties of such department should ba performed by the Attorney-General or the SoUcitor-General. ? T)foítunate1y happened that the engagements of the Lord ChanceUor and the Attorney-General were such that they appeared to have no time for consultation; they did not act in unison; and, if he might be allowed the expression, in the shipwreck of law reform thoy floated away in contrary directions, upon different rafts. The resolution affirmed that there ought to be "a separate and responsible department for the affairs of public justice/' and in that proposition he did not hesitate to çriicur. Such a department might coUect most valuable information, and greatly improve the judicial statistics of the country. It might receive and record suggestions from the judges or other parties worthy of attention, and conduct methodically and scientificaUy inquiries which were now deputed to many desultory commissions. The functions of such a department might also include the progressive amendment of the law. TJnder that head he placed the consolidation of the statute law, and, with respect to the plan of the present Statute Law Commission, of consolidating the acts relating to certain subjects from time to time, he thought it neither the best nor most expeditious mode of proceeding. It should be done as a whole, by a competent staff, under the supervision of a competent officer and when done submitted to Parliament for confirmation bv one instead of by 500 acts. The department of public justice might also have the duty of preparing and passing through Parliament the measures of law reform for which the Government consented to be responsible. Ho would like to see those measures taken up by the Government in a determined spirit, and as much importance attached to bebe beaten on an ecclesiastical courts bill as upon any other question of foreign or domestic poUcy. (Hear.) The department might correct current legislabon, instead of that duty beine delegated to a board under tibe superintendence of the two Houses of Parliament; not that he would aUow any interference with private legislation, but merely give members the opportunity of obtaining assistance and advice. It was a question for grave consideration whether the head of the department might not be intrusted with a power of supervision over the County Court judges and justices of the peace, and the power of cnmmal appeal, now in the hands of the Secretaiy of State for the Homef Department: Be did not for a moment wish to insinuate that those functions were not properly performed by the right hon. baronet (Sir J»· Grey), but the question was, whether they ought not to be performed by some high legal authority. He had riven an outline of the duties which might bo advantage. ously imposed upon the department of public instile With respect to the head of it, the motion did not state whether he would sit in the House of Lords or m the House of Commons. It would be perfectly con Ü -ÍÍ Wlth tbe resolution to make the Lord Chancellor the Minister of Justice, and that point, in his opinion deserved consideration. But if the duties of the Lord c'hanrel,or were too onerous to aUow of such an arrangement then, the head of the department ought to be a member of the House of Commons-? plan, which, in some respects, nnghtbe still more advantageous. He approved ofthe motion not fettering the decision of the Government-and though it might be said to be only an abstract resolution, he had faith in the efficacy of abstract resolutions. He believed that m affirming the resolution they would be accomplishing an object long and ardently desired by law reformers, and taking one of the most important steps towards rendering the administration of justice consonant with the Wi-nts and civUization of the people. (Hear, hear.) ? i- \ > The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said, the question had not escaped the attention of the Government, but they had re. served until this discussion the statement of their viewsHe did not complain of the resolution because it wascouched in general terms, and in accepting it with some slight modification it must be distinctly understood that the Government did not recognize as a consequence of its adoption the establishment of a separate minister of justice. He did not think that, at present, there was any necessity for the introduction of such an officer. (Hear, hear.) Ha thought that aU the objects ofthe resolution might be more effectually carried out by means of existing machinery than by instituting a change in the constitution. It would be abundantly clear to those who had given the subject anything beyond the most superficial attention that it was utterly impossible to inboduce into the Cabinet a ministe* of justice, while the Lord Chancellor and;the Home Secretary were members of it, without inboducing also disagreement and contention, and destroying, in point of fact, that unity which was essential toits efficiency. (Hear, hear.) A few years ago a new bibunal was constituted-the Court °i vipv · °ï,the iolàb Justices. One of the reasons for establishing that tribunal was that, by relieving the Lord Chancellor of a portion of the judicial duties which pressed so heavily upon him, it would be in his power to discharge more directly the duties that belonged to him as a minister of justice. It was perfectly within the power of that distinguished officer, if he were armed with a sufficient staff, to accomplish ?? that was needed. Three great objects were proposed to be accomplished-first, the complete and effectual superintendence over the administration of justice J ff'x. ii departments ; secondly, the superintending and effectually carrying out the process of the amendment of the Jaw ; and, thirdly, the givbg prompt, effectual, and complete assistance to the business of current legislation. Ihe Government would not omit to give that
attention to the subject of the present resolution which its importance deserved, but one great peculiarity and misfortune was the constitution and distinct jurisdicbon of our courts. There were a great number of courts, none of which were armed with the power of doingjustice on any one subject. The necessity was, therefore, imposed upon the suitor of resorting to a great number of courts to obtain a little portion of justice, first from one and then from the other. That state of things ought not to be allowed to continue, but the apathy of the people of this country in regard to law reform was so great that it was not easy to carry a change in the law. If flüs system continued it spoke plainly enough for the necessity of there being some great department charged with the duty of carei^ r?r *",d superintending the working of these numerous tribunals, and endeavouring to reduce into harmony a system which was otherwise altogether incongruous. ? small portion of insolvency was committed to the InsolSS.lr^X'n Pirtlon ?f Dankr»ptey was intrusted to the «f^ÍSSr3 ????' a?°-ther natatory tribunal had the duty cc^Slff0^ *e Winding-up Acts, and there were the courts of law, which were opposed to the courts of equity. ¿ulîZïl?T*?T-0?T!?* Conrt friges, and there wis 3»fL.K "system of .criminal procedure, which was utterly Tl7,ln principle.

But the ileasurl with those alterations, was not ready until so kfeasS that it was utterly imponible to carry it through MlS in the course of last session. The time had been lost in decidrh!ÍtTlnvÍheSlCOm^tí?re «temes; whereas? if onTof them had been brought forward with the sanction of a great department, the House would have had no düficnltv in adopting it. Many of the discussions ^«bS lltLt0iSnplaf^andrded mno'hing won» be avoided tf every bill introduced were sanctioned by proper authorities: He would advert to another circumstance wÉfch proved the ÄTÄl/ ?omearra4geme?t. The law consisted of the written and of the unwritten law. The written law was composed of a great number of statutes, many of them! unfortunately, so inconsistent with each other that it was extremely difficult to ascertain the exact state of the bw? The unwritten law was even in a worse position. It was to be found in many hundred volumes of reports, to which continual additions were bemg made without any sufficient authority or any proper control. Any gentleman of the bar l& J?bIähed a V4?me,o£ case5 and Çrefixed his name to it added to the unwritten law, and numbers of volumes were, m fact bemg produced, year after year, which judges felt bound to recognize when they were cited in courts of j-ustice. The laws of a great country ought not to be embodied in such unauthorized, unauthentic pubUcations as these. ÄÄ ?? "?** Uw re4uired ????011· «on»: lidation, and reduction, the same process was required in a "Ä (FT fttha Tjntt« Uw, but that process could only be effectually earned on under the guidance of a great department (Hear.) In the observations he had made lUustratvng the necessity of immediate attention being paid to the subject ho had stated more particularly his own views andopiniona to which the Government were nottoberegarded as pledged. If, however, therighthon. andlearnedgentllman^ mobon were carried with the alterabon he had suggested he could assure the House that it would not be treatedalá mere formal important matter, but that it would at oncebe takenmto consideration by the Government, and, hehoped? be productive of the most valuable effects. (???, hear. ) Lord J. RUSSELL.-The speech of the right'hon. 'and learned Attorney-General appears to me to consist of two parts. The first and the larger part is a very powerful argument in favour of the proposition of the right hon. and learned gentleman. The right hou. and learned gentleman told us of the confusion exist ing. not only in the law but abo in the various tribunals which administer the law in a different manner and upon principles which cannot be reconcUed with each other ; and he pointed out the defects of the criminal law, likewise arising, as he declared, from that multitude of statutes to which Lord Hardwicke aUuded in the quotation made by the nghthon. and learned gentleman, and from the difficulty lately described, too, by the Lord Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench, of exbactingaclearanddefinitesense from the various acts passed through Parliament. Upon that topic, and upon several others into which I shaU certainly not attempt to f oUow him, the hon. and learned gentleman has shown the House m a most convincing manner, not only that the right hon. and learned gentleman's proposition is founded upon sound principles, but that it requires instant and urgent consideration. I cannot, therefore, but be satisfied at finding tho very able arguments of the right hon. and learned gentleman supported and confirmed, not only by the authority but by the reasoning of the hon. and learned gentleman. But when I come to the principal question, namely-the adoption of the plan ofthe right hon. gentleman-I find that the second part of the hon. and learned gentleman's speech, in which he considers that question, is eminently unsatisfactory. (Hear hear.) Not only is it eminently unsatisfactory in itaelf ; but the latter part of it does much to efface the effect ofthe hon. and learned gentleman's own arguments and sentiments, for it contains the statement that they are not the arguments and sentiments of tho Government, but only those of the hon. and learned gentleman. (Hear hear.) When the hon. and learned gentleman does not confine himself to a statement of his own opinions, when K,e,ÄD°ldraw hh *?0? ÎIPm ?? own knowledge only, ??T\ h? expresses the views of the Government, he omiJl "VU rePared,to ????? to the motion with the T,£T iL ffv, word? wblch ha do« "ot think imÄ ? ii h0?.gh }le exPlatos that thoir omission would in f"?tínÄalteríhe S,0hem? of,.the riSht hon· a°d 'earned gentleman (hear, hear), and that, instead of having a minister of justice, or in the very weU chosen words ofthe right hon. and learned gentleman, " a separate and respT! sible department," it is intended 'that weP should hav?the ^nf"P fnCelbi'.alded by certaia ?05«** to be appointed for that purpose.

X ^il^írthen eonceive that no person could be more ht than the Homo Secretary-certainly none better able than the present Home Secretary-to administer a great department for the amendment of the law and for the affairs of pubUc justice. Of course he must have fit and competent persons under him, and this House would be found ready to vote tho necessary saUries. (Hear, hear ) But either in this way or by a Minister, according to the right hon. gentleman's proposal, this great department of pubhc jushce might be conducted. I own I have no sanguine expectations of any great reforms in law being carried many other way; and I fear that, unless we proceed by taking some step of this kind, those great objects to which the Attorney-General aUuded would hardly be carried into effect. (Hear.) I fear, for instance, that in this session, as in former sessions, plans would bo proposed, would be very much discussed disputed, and altered, and afterwards, when everybody s attention flags, when men's bodies were exhausted by labour and their minds bythe consideration of various poUbcal topics, the bills would bygeneral consent be withdrawn. (Hear, hear.) I wish to see the views of the Attorney-General earned mto effect. I think he has Urge and bold views, but I beUeve I shaU assist in carrying them into effect more effectuaUy by declining to accede to his present proposition and by supporting the motion of the bon nght hon. gentleman opposite. (Hear, hear.) i ^ ?-JFEATING, ?,0^ that °n » subject with respect to which there prevaüed so muoh unanimily, the AttorneyGeneral would not create a difference of opinion by insisting on his suggested amendment. Everybody seemed to agree m the propnety of that being done which the present mohon proposed should be done ; and the only point of difference was as to who should preside over this great department. He concurred in opinion with the AttorneyGeneral that the Lord ChanceUor would be the proper and legitimate president of the department. The noble lord had suggested that the Secretary for the Home Department might be a proper person for such an office if relieved from some of his present duties ; but, in his (Mr. Keating's) opinion, the Lord ChanceUor was the legitimate and natural officer to be at the head of a department of this kind. lhat noble and learned lord was connected with aU those departments with which it would be essential to communicate under the scheme of the right hon. gentleman, and, however efficiently tho present Home Secretary conducted the duties of his office, stffl, whenever he had to interfere with those tribunals by which the adminisbation of jusbce was conducted, his communicabons were carried on in a roundabout, indirect, and by no means satisfactory way It was the absence of that staff which the right hon. and learned member for Dublin University sought to have ??painted, more than the numerous occupations of the Lord ChanceUor, that prevented unity of action in the administration of our laws. That staff would furnish him with the means of doing what was at present impossible. The country was indebted to the right hon. and learned gentleman for the persevering and able manner in which he had pressed his important proposition on the House. Until that proposition was effectuaUy adopted eonsoUdation of the law would be whoUy impossible, for to attempt to consolidate the law in the first instance was to begin at the wrong end. The current legislation must be brought into proper condition before consolidation could become possible. When control over that legislation was given to a department of justice eonsoUdation could go on graduaUy and concurrently with it. Her Majesty's Government would find that the opinions which had been expressed by the Attorney-General were entertained by both sides of the House ; and the Government would therefore be compelled to identify themselves with those opinions. The effectual adoption of the scheme of the right hon. and learned gentleman (Mr. Napier) would put an end to those continually recurring debates about law reform wbich must have disgusted the non-legal members of the House. The ATTORNEY-GENERAL.-In proposing the omission of the words " as an urgent measure of administrative reform, I did not for a moment desire to curtail the efficiency ofthe resolution (hear, hear) ; but they struck me as bemg words unusual-and I might almost say a little unseemly-in an address to the Crown. Inasmuch, however, as some apprehension has been entertained that the omission of those words might impair the efficiency of the resolution, the Government have not the smallest objection to their remaining in it. (Hear, hear.) Mr. WIGRAM believed that it was essential to the effectual working of the proposed scheme that there should be some great pubUc officer at tho head of the department of justice who should apply his undivided attention to the subject, and that he should have a seat in that house, in order that he might watch the progress of legislation, and take care that it should be consonant with the principles of our laws. Mr. W. EWART congratulated the right hon. and learned gentleman (Mr. Napier) on the success of his efforts, and concurred with the last speaker as to the necessity of the proposed minister of justice having a seat in that house, in order that he might answer the appeals made to him by the representatives of the people, as was already the case with regard to the heads of the Board of Health, the Poor Law Board, and other public departments. He regarded the scheme of the right hon. and learned gentleman as the foundation of aU law reform. Sir E. PERRY thought that the suggestion of the Attorney-General that the Lord ChanceUor should be at the head of the proposed department was eminently subversive of the object of the resolution. The headship of the proposed department was one of the questions at issue, and, for his own part, he attached great importance to the opinion which had been expressed by the noble lord the member for London, that tho Home-office, which already exercised a superintendence over the administration of criminal law throughout the country, ought to be at the head of the proposed system of superintendence. Whether, however, the headship of tho department was given to the Home Secretary or the Lord ChanceUor, no doubt a large staff would be necessary. One objection to making the Lord ChanceUor the head of the department appeared to him to be that he himself as a judge would naturally faU within the supervision of the dopartmont. and it was not reasonable that he should be called upon to judge of his own acts. Another reason why he thought that it would be better for a layman to be at the head of the proposed department was that English Lawyers, who as practitioners were, perhaps, the best in the world, were not scientific jurists. The object of the resolution would therefore not be fully carried out, unless a layman, assisted by a numerous and able staff, wero placed at the head of the proposed department. Mr. M. CHAMBERS thought that a great amount of timidity and trepidation had been shown in dealing with a great question. The resolution had been most carefully and cautiously worded, so that, with tho exception of the words 'administrative reform," to which the Attorney-General had * j ni exception, there was nothing in it to cavil at, while it dealt with a most importent question. It, in point of fact, involved no les« than the establishment of a new great and responsible public office, tho holder of which would have most difficult duties to perform. Among others, one subject with whioh he would have to deal was the written law, and that alone would require a person not only of great expenence, but also of great activity. Then, a^ain, tho department would be called upon to superintend aU current legislation, and that duty wonld require almost the undivided attention of the head of that department. He did not advance these statements with any view of throwing cold water on the proposal ; but, on the contrary, he beUeved that rf the staff were an efficient one-and'it could not be efficient unless men were weU paid-it would in reality be of great service, and at tho same time would save a great deal of expense. That the new department should be presided over either by the Lord Chancellor or the Home Secretary was, in his °.PIÎ10?' lmP°ssible. »s the functions to be discharged by both those officers were already sufficiently numerous and arduous. As to tho Lord ChanceUor, it was impossible that u should not happen that measures introduced into either House of Parliament under his sanction should be open to the censure of those who read as they ran. Not having time to attend to the preparation of such measures himself, he had to select for that duty three or four confidential persons for whose appointment he was not responsible, and who themselves had no responsibility. These persons were often incompetent to the discharge of the duties inbusted to them, and then the Lord ChanceUor was blamed for measures which were ineffectual and unsatisfactory. Tho pressure for law reform would render necessary the adoption of some such measure as that proposed by his right hon. and earned friend. It had boen objected that the creation of such an office as was suggested would constantly interfere with the freedom of private members in regard to tbe introduction of bUls and the proposition of useful changes. He did not beUeve it would have any such an effect. On the contrary, he believed that by leading to tho improvement of the Ministerial measures, and thus diminishing the time occupied in debating thom, it would leave open more days for the considerations of the motions or the bffls of private members. (Hear, hear.) Mr. MALINS said that, although the House had been engaged in the discussion of a very beautiful theory, he beieved that it would end in nothing but disappointment. We had already a great legal officer, the Lord Chancellor, whose duty it was to superintend the reform of the law - and the only excuse which he (??. Malins) had heard for he creation of another officer co-ordinate with, or superior o, him was that he had no opportunity of attending to heseduhes. He thought this was an entirely erroneous hypothesis. In ISal two additional legal officers, the Lords Jusbces, were appointed, in order to got rid of an accumula-
tion of 70 or 100 appeals in tho Court of Chancery. They were appointed under the general impression that they would bring to an end a nystem which had been long objected to-that of an appeal from one judge to another judge fitting alone. To the great surprise of the profession those learned persons at once proceeded to sit in separate courts, and as a rule the Lord ChanceUor always sat alone. It was now said that the Lord ChanceUor had not time to attend to the business of legiJation. He (Mr. Malins) assured tho House, however, that they need be under no apprehension of arrears in the Court of Chancery. List Monday tho Court commenced a sitting which was to endure uninterruptedly for seven weeks, and the Lord ChanceUor nad then only three appeals upon his paper. The Lords Justices had six appeals upon their list, but they took a great deal of onginal business, which was enough fully to engage their fame from day to day; but that there was business enough to occupy the Lord Chancellor and hT ? ?\ ?"8'10"* »?» he emphaticaUy denied ; ibi fe hrghî ,that .tbere ?(??? te no greater farce £Ämp ° maJLnt»;n two courts of Ippeal in the ^.f V ????17· ?,? had practised very extensively before the Lord Chancellor, and he would say that a judge l^P* ?,"4, "^.painstaking, who more thoroughly and undividedly gave his attention to the business coSdto him he bad never practised before, and probably never should. (Hear, hear.) He had no reason for saying thü? : íltlh?íe SaW that attacks were Tade whichffid to be totaUy unwarranted, he thought it was only right w a matter of justice that he should Ixpress that which wa^ within his own knowledge.

Yet that something must be done in that direction the publio out of doors demanded, and that House, with a degree of unanimity which wassomething wonderful (»laugh), seemed to concur in the justice of that dtmand. What he feared most, however, wra lest the Government who wero listening to that discussion should in any way "keep the word of promise to the ear, and break t to the sense !"

of the duty with the guarantee of having passed through a fitting examination. An error in point of fact, committed by a revising barrister, could not be rectified without an expensive and even a ruinous reference to an election committee, while an error in point of law could not be set «ide without a costly reference to the Court of Common Pleas. The subject of legal education was one which had long occupied tho attention of the Inns of Court. A very serious difference of opmion existed upon it in the inn with which he had the honour to be connected-the Inner lemple-though for his own part he was entirely in favour of a compulsory examination. He could mention the names of many distinguished benchers-Mr. HaUam, Dr. Lushington. and others-who entertained different opinions on tlie subjeot, wnich consequently the House would perceive was surrounded by great difficulties. But it was now in the bands of thebenohersof the four Inns of Court, who were the persons most competent to deal with it, and he hoped they would be permitted in their own way to arrive at a proper and efficient arrangement. (Hear hear.) Lord PALMERSTON.-In agreeing to the motion of the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Dublin I am quite ready to say that we adopt it, not simply with tho view of terminating the debate, but for the purpose of endeavouring to give effect to the principle embodied in the resolution, and which appears to havo received the general concurrence of the House. (Hear, hear.) That principle I take to be that some real effort should be made to organize departmental arrangement! for promoting ref orms and improvements of the law. ^ What has passed in this evening's debate must show how impossible it is for the Government at once to state anything certain as tothe particular method of attaining the object aimed at in the resolution. (Hear, hear.) It is very easy for people to agre e upon the desirabiüty of removing existing defects, but when they come to propose a remedy there arises every sort of difference of opinion. (Hear, hear.) According tothe old rhyme" Wo what to avoid no great knowledge need. " But what to follow ia a task indeed," (A Uugh.) The subject, doubtless, is one of immense importance. Everybody mustaokuow ledge that great improve. ments may be made in our system of laws, and for that purpose you require the com bined efforts of a number of men who have turned their mì nds-if I may say so-to the philosophy of the Uw. You do not require men who have distinguished themselves in the active exertion of pleading, but men who have thought deeply upon the principles of ·???·« V?08gh they may not, perhaps, have been gifted with that eloquence which is necessary to the celebrated advocate. Such are the men who would be most useful in pointing out reforms, and in directing the course of those whose duty it should be to propose them to ParUament. We have heard discussions as to whether there should be a new Minister to be caUed a minister of justice, or whether, on the contrary, we ought to buUd upon existing foundations, and attach the new department either to the Lord ChanceUor or the Secretary of State for the Home Department. I shaU not go into these two alternatives ; but I think that before the House should agree to adopt foreign models, and institute what is called a ministry of justice-an office the occupant of which must, to a certain degree, be a Uwyer, who therefore would be caUed upon to abandon his profession, who would be, I apprehend, a member of the Administration of the day, and who, consequently, when the Government ceased to exist would be in a position requiring ample provision to be made for him-it ought to consider whether it could not accomplish its purpose by attaching the new department to some existing branch of the executive. (Hear, hear. ) I can assure the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Dublin that it shaU be tho duty of the Government to give their earnest attention to this subject. It is one which he himself admits is surrounded by great difficulties, and which wffl require very mature consideration. That' consideration shaU be given, and I am not without hopes that those difficulties may be overcome. I am sure of one thing-that the right hon. gentleman is rendering a service to the country by calling the attention of ParUament to this matter ; and if the resolution which he has made this evening shaU be the foundation upon which a great system of legal reform and improvement shaU be erected ho will deserve the thanks of the pubUo, and wffl feel satisfaction at having promoted the best and most important interests ?? the empire. We shaU therefore agree to his resolution, as a pledge of our intention to meet the wishes of the House and of the counby on the subject of the improvement ofthe law,-a subject which I beUeve excites a greater interest in the pubUc mind than almost any other that oould be named. (Hear, hear.) Mr. HADFIELD would consent to almost any change that would be proposed, as it was almost impossible matters could be worse than they were at present. The most necessary legal reforms could not be carried without the utmost difficulty. Take the case of testamentary jurisdiction. Bül after bffl had been brought forward on this subject by the Lord ChanceUor, but the pubUc expectations had never been satisfied, and he asked the law officers of the Crown whether they thought the measure which had just been brought into the other house had the slightest chance of passing. (Hear.) The Uw of mortmain, too, wnich affected every charity and educational institution in .bngland, called for amendment, and though bffls for that object bad passed that House they had always been dropped in the other house for the want of some person to take them up. He hoped, therefore, that the motion of the right hon gentleman the member for the University of Dublin would give them some reUof by clearing the way for these rather important reforms. (Hear, hear. ) Mr. NAPIER was gratified to find tbt he had the almost unanimous opmion ofthe House in his favour, and that the noble lord had given an assurance that the resolutions would be taken mto consideration in a bona fi de manner. That "????? could, Possibly expect. (Hear, hear.) He had worded the resolution so as not to have the appearance of dictating either to the House or to the Government, and had purposely framed it in general terms. Nothing, in his opmion, could more strikingly exemplify the necessity for some such measure as he proposed than the case of the bül referred to by the hon. member for WaUingford. He said, the Lord ChanceUor was the true minister of justice, and yet, no doubt in consequence ;of the great amount of business the noble and learned lord had to perform, his hon. and learned friend had not been able to communicate with him on the subject of his very useful bül ; but if there had been an office or department such as hè now proposed, his hon. and learned friend would have had nodifficulty in'carrying his measure. (Hear, hear.) He TiZf **£ tether a layman or a lawyer should be appointed. He should be sorry to say he should not be a layman ; he would bo equally sorry to say he should not rt" *a f*?**· ..What concerned him most was that the duty should be efficiently discharged. He agreed with the noble lord m thinking that they sSould hrst try to make use of such means as now existed, and see how far they could accomplish the object in view ; and if ??30????? f?nna ^adequate, that then such additions «mould be made as circumstances rendered necessary. He was sangrune that, however smaU the beginning might be it would be a most useful reform-one that would add to the credit of the Government, the honour of that House, and the welfare of the country. (Hear, hear.) Ihe motion was then agreed to. CHURCH-RATES. i.i.S4.T-V-CLA-J ?08*5 ï° moTe f01 leave to bring in a biUfor the abolition of church-rates, the ?? to be limited to the tota abolition of such rates, and a provision saving existing legal ob igations. The bill, he saia, had not only the saml object, but w-as identical in terms with the measure which he had introduced on thesame subject during the last session of Parliament, and the only difference was that a portion of the former measure was omitted from the present bffl. He therefore felt it unnecessary to trouble the House with anv observations, but when he moved the second reading he would expiam the reasons which had induced him to make the omission to which he had referred, and he would also lee; it his duty to comment upon the important returns relating to the_ subject which had been laid upon the table in compliance with the motion of a noble lord opposite. Mr.SPOONERsaid that, although he and hishon. friends on that side the House would not oppose the motion it m£? u ?u f8 apposed that they gave any assent to the bffl which the hon. baronet asked leave to introduce, and which provided^forthe simple, absolute, and unconditional abolition of church-rates. He thought it would be convenient to the House and to the country to learn what course Her Majesty's Government intended to take on this subject. lhey had already stated that they did not themselves intend to bring m ? ?, and that they were not prepared to say that they would move amendments to any measure which might be introduced. the 4;^B°VCH?KtI obse^á that his n'ehfc bon. friend the Secretary for the Home Department had stated on a tonner occasion that the Government had no intention of introducing any measure on this subject during the present session; but he said that when the question was brought before the House -that wonld be the proper time for the Government to declare what course they intended to pursue. He (Mr. Labouchere) hoped the hon. gentleman would not expect the Government now to go out of the way to express their opinion, but when the second reading of this bill came on, no doubt his noble friend (Lord Palmerston) or the Home Secretary would state the views entertained by the Government. Leave was then given to bring in the bffl. GENERAL POLLOCK AND THE BOARD OF CONTROL. Captain L. VERNON, in moving for the correspondence relating to the removal of General PoUock, G.C.B., from the direction of the East India Company, said that some time ago, when he caUed the attention of the House to the employment of general officers in the seientific corps of the army, he mentioned the name of Sir George PoUock as an officer of artillery of extraordinary merit, and stated that that officer had been selected from officers of every arm in the service of the Crown and of the Company to re-establish the supremacy of the British arms in India, and to restore to those arms the lustre which had been tarnished by the igno minious disasters of Cabul. General PoUook achieved those objects in as brffliant and decisive a campaign as wa recorded in the history of this or any other country. In January, 1842, the British army, nominally cominar ded by General Elphinstone, but unfortunately actuaUy under the control of Sir W.M'Naghten, having f or 65 days endured greater humffiations than had ever been suffered by British troop^J^ur»nde»4 their position, and on the 6th of that month 4,a00 fighting men, encumbered by thrice that number oí camp foUowers, prepared to retreat from Cabul. On the 12th of January a eoUtary horseman, the messenger of death, crawled into JelUUbad. He was, with the exception tíwTrTf61.' fch.es°ie survivor of 17.0CO personswho had left Cabul only six days before, thus verifying to the very letter the singular prediction of Colonel Denny-that i the retreat was undertaken only one man would survive who would bear to the British posts the news that the res of the army had perished. This inieUigeuce paralyzed th Executive, cowed the military spirit of the fcepoys, and
shook toit,r very centre that huge mosaic-the British emKlf ? he Panm-stricken authorities had then to fl,lvL£ n '" "???? to «be emergency. That man they S ? ?

General Pollock w», then an artfflery officer of some 40 years' standing ; he had served at Bhurtpore ; he hadbeen selected by bord Lake to command the artfflery sent in pursuit of Holkar ; he commanded the Bengal artillery at Rangoon in the first Burmese war ; »nd for tliese services he waf made rJS^fp ??0* the ¿Brth· He (C»Ptain Vernon) knew ??? "· w°î.k on'? bj reputation, and had never even /*I ifcw rtef0nnd Îtwas stated ^Kay¿s Bütory of the If or that the appointment of General Pollock gave the greatest satisfaction to the Supreme Government, and that not even a murmur of disapprobation rose from the general body of the army. The same writer said it was beUeved that General PoUook had been selected solely on the ground of individual ment, and described him as thoroughly conscientious, as actuated by the highest principles and the purest motives, as cool, firm, decided, and essentially an honest man. (????, hear.) General Pollock being an Indian officer, the Horse Guards, of course, cavilled at his appointment, and the Commander-in-Chief in India bir Jasper Nicholls, had to defend the appointment in a letter to Lota btzroy Somerset, in whioh he bore testimony to til- admirable manner in which General PoUock had conducted his operations. Before General Pollock appeared upon the scene disaster had foUowed upon disaster. Ghuznee had been taken, the army was destroyed, and General Wylde had been beaten back from the Khyber Pass. General Pollock carried the passes at the point of the bayonet, he relieved JeUalabad, he defeated the Affghans in three battles, he liberated the prisoners, he planted the Untasti flag upon the oitadel of Cabul, and he reconducted his victorious army through the formidable passes in triumph and without loss. Ihe whole empire rang with his achievements, for aU men felt that by him India had been saved. The House would be able to contrast by the Ust which he was about to read the manner in whioh services in India were rewarded before General PoUook's time, and the manner in which they were rewarded in his person. For his successes against the Mahrattas General Lake was made Lord Lake, General Harns was made Lord Harris for the capture of Seringapatam ; Sir Stapleton Cotton was made Lord Combermere for the capture of Bhurtpore,· Sir John Keane, Lord Keane, for the capture of of Ghuznee ; Sir Hugh Gough and Sir Henry Hardinge wore raised to tbe peerage for the Sutlej campaign ; General WiUshire was made a baronet for the capture of Kbelat; General Sir H. Smith, a baronet for the battle of Aliwal ; General Ochterlony, a baronet for Nepaul ; General Gilbert, a baronet for successes against the Sikhs; General CampbeU, a baronet for services in Burmah; and Lord EUenborough created an tari and a G.C.B. for the successes in Affghanistan, China, and Scinde. For saving IndU General PoUock received the thanks of ParUament, and was made a Grand Cross of the Bath, of which order he was already a commander ; and his second in command was also made a G.C.B., though he had notreceived tho intennediatedistinc;}.0Di ,(He?r· ) Twelve years afterwards-in 1854-it became the duty of the Government to appoint three directors to the Board of Direction of the East India Company. The right hon. member for Halifax, the then President of the ISoard of Control, signified to General PoUock his intention to name him as one of the directors in the foUowing letter, which was as honourable to the right hon. gentleman as gratifying to the gaUant general :- «at ? *? ? "IndiaBoard, April7,1854. My dear Sir George,-The time for the nomination of three directors of the East India Company by the Crown having arrived, it becomes my duty to recommend to Her Majesty the persons whom I beUeve to be most capable of discharging the important duties of directors, and to possess such qualifications as wffl complete the Court in fuU efficiency for the performance ofthe various functions inbusted to them in reference to the government of India. Among those duties one of the most important is the superintendence of the large mffitery force of the Company, and I am anxious to see a tried soldier among the directors, weU acquainted with the requirements of the military service in ? a' «. one ?? more triumphantly led that army, and TJr.th« most trying circumstances, than yourself, and I shall have great pleasure inmarking mysenseof yourservices in that army by recommending you to the Queen as one of the directors to be named by Her Majesty. You wffl be thesemorof the three whomlshaU recommend, and, according to the course adopted by the Court as to the directors whom they haye chosen, I shaU propose to place your name the first on the hst, and for the period of two years, as I must name the period in conformity with the act. They have named the seniors for the shorter period, and I shaU thus have placed the nominated and elected directors as far as possible on the same footing. " I am, &c, " Charles Wood." These three directors nominated, bythe Government, it must be observed, were equaUy eligible for reappointment with the directors elected by the Company. The post of senior director was given to General Pollock for his unpayable services m India, and in order to place the two other directors on an equal footing with their coUeagues they were nominated for four and six years respectively. Neither of these two gentlemen had served in IndU, and it was therefore fair to ansume that it was intended to reappoint General PoUock at the end of the two years. Had it not been so, he being the person who had the greatest claims would naturaUy have been named for the longest period. That was the generally received opinion (hear), and it was General Pollock s own opmion. In due course, however, he received the following letter from the present President of the Board of Control :- «, " . ". " " India Board, March 20,1856. My dear Sir George,-I think it due to the high consideration I entertain for your character and services to intorni you, before the period arrives, of the course I think it my duty to pursue upon the vacancy that wffl be oreated in the Court of Directors by the expiration of the term of your appomtment. Upon a careful revision of the discussions on the act of 18o3, ? which I took part myself, I am convinced that it was the intention of'the legislature that a iresh appomtment, and not a re-appointment, should be the general rule to be foUowed by the Minister of the Crown in his recommendations to Her Majesty. As this is the nrst occasion on which the exercise of this disoretion has occurred, I think it most desirable to maintain the principle whereby in my opinion the direction wffl be made most valuable, and therefore, in spite of the high value I set upon your services, it is not my intention to propose your reappointment. I am unaware at this mornent whether, if I had found it compatible with my public duty to offer you the office again, you would have wished to accept it, and therefore it Is quite open to you to let it be considered that you would not, if more agreeable to vou - at any rate, I trust that you wffl understand that my course" is entirely presenbed by pubUc principle, and that nothing in it can m the least detract from that high renown which places your name among the first in Indian annals of war"I am, with the sincerest respect, " Yours very truly, "R.

the removal of General PoUock, G.C.B., from the direction ofthe Hon. £aat India Company. Mr. V. SMITH.-My answer to the motion of the hon. gentleman U simply this :-There is no official correspondence in existence as to the non-reappoinbnent of Sir G. Pollock, and that Sir G. Pollock never was removed from his office, and therefore the hon. member is doing Sir G. Pollock a wrong in speaking of his removal from office. (Murmurs.) Such a thing was never contempUted, and never done. That, Sir, would be a sufficient answer to the motion of the hon. gentleman to prevent it being put from the chair, but he has entered with considerable detail into a question upon which I think it is my duty to f oUow him. As regards the preliminary part of his speech, in which ho spoke of the achievements of Sir G. Pollock, it is utterly impossible for any one to deny the splendid victories achieved by Sir G. PoUock in Affghanistan, and I should be the last man to at". tempt to do so. I had occasion to mention them in pubUo when I met Sir G. PoUock at a dinner at the East India House, upon which occasion I said that that gaUant officer had exeoufed that magnificent manouvre which drove the ????????? from their precipitous fastnesses, and that Nadir Shah had only accomplished by corruption what Sir G. PoUock had done by force of arms. Theití is no statement which can be made of the glory of that officers career which I am not ready to endorse. If the honours which Sir G. PoUock has received from the Crown have been an inadequate reward, the proper course would have been to move an address to the Crown, praying that further honours might be bestowed. I must say I have the greatest reason to compUin of the conduct of the hon. member towards me. This is the first instance in my experience in whioh an hon. member has thought it his duty to read private letters, without first giving notice to the person whom they chiefly concerned. Those letters were private, as aU who know the course pursued reUtive to the exeroise of the pabonage of «? »"??6 ?'?· ""> hon. gentleman did not say whether he had the consent of Sir G. PoUock to read them, and I should doubt much whether that gaUant officer would have sanctioned such a course. That however, is a question between the hon. member and myself, but, nevertheless, it leaves me completely disarmed, as I have had no opportunity of referring to any notes of my own to ascertain whether there were other letters than those which have been read. ?? far as I recollect, the çucumstances were these :-I knew I should be caUed upon m April, I806, to appoint a director of the East IndU Company. Several private communications took place between myself and the chairman of that Company, who asked me whether I intended to reappoint Sir G. PoUock ; to which I replied, decidedly not ; and in conversation I expressed to hnn, what I now repeat to the House, my extreme pain that 1 should not find it consistent with mv duty to reappoint that gaUant officer. I put the question whether Sir G. PoUock was willing to made any intimation to me, or whether he had any wish to be re-appointed, but I never heard either from the chairman or Sir G. PoUock upon the subject. I am sure the House wffl beUeve that the most painful situation a pubUc ""?·0*?! Piaeed in is when he is caUed upon by his public duty to act with what may appear harshness towards a person for whom he entertains the highest respect. If it is a charge against me that, in endeavouring to soften as much as possible any feelings of irritation which Sir G. PoUock might entertain, I went too far in the letter which has been read, I bow to the charge, and say, I would have gone thrice as far to avoid causing him pain. My impression in writing that letter was that I was paying Sir G. PoUock every compUment I could think of. (Laughter.) 1 repeat it. It was my duty to consider whether Sir G. PoUock was a fit person to be reappointed, and I thought he was not; and, in writing that letter, I did aU I could to lessen any irritation which he might feel. It was a painful duty to make such a communication to a man of his rank »nd character, but I did not choose to shrink from it. In 1853 a discussion took place in this house upon the India ??, in which I and others who took part in it expressed opinions that the object to be gained by a Government nomination of East India directors was the infusion of fresh blood into the direction ; and my hon. friend the member for Huntingdon went so far »s to propose that no person should be elected a director who had been absent more than five years from India. Thus, when it became my duty to make a selection, I felt I could not recommend the appointment of bir G. PoUock, and in his place I recommended Sir H. Rawlinson, a man of world-wide diplomatic and military character. Soon after Mr. L. Melville died, and I then recommended the appointment of General Vivian, upon the sole ground of advantage to the State. Surely I cannot be charged with improper motives or sinister objects in making those recommendations. If I had wished to consult my own convenience, there are no directors a President of the Board of Control would prefer to gentlemen who never interfere with him. The hon. member seems to consider the board of directors as a place of honourable retirement. ( "No ' " ) The hon. gentìeman asked, was that ? reward 'for bir G. PoUock's services? No one thought it was a reward. His rewards were the dignities conforred upon him by his Sovereign and counby. 7 ri? was to snPPiy the direction with new blood, to select the most useful men for the office. I have done so. Ihe public and the press at home and in IndU have approved my choice. This motion is a proof of the difficulty which a Minister experiences in the performance of his duties, lhere is an outcry for administrative reform, and hon. gentlemen are continuaUy watching the actions of the Government to see whether they put "the right man in the nght place :" and yet, when it becomes my misfortune to be compeUed to supersede a gentleman whom I do not think competent f rom his infirmities of age to discharge the duties of the office, I am charged with an improper dismissal. I did not dismiss Sir G. PoUock, nothini should have induced me to do so, but the two years for which he was appointed having expired I declined to reappoint him. Ihe hon. member says I should thank him for having brought this matter forward : but I do not think he has given either Sir G. Pollock or myself any reason for thanks, as he has compeUed me to state tilines which I have been most unwilling to say. My only desire has been to avoid wounding tho feelings of S>ir G. PoUock. (Hear, hear.) If I outstepped prudence m proposing that he should resign instead of not being reappointed, or if there be anything fflogical in my letter, it arose from that motive. I shaU never regret, nor am I now ashamed of the suggestion I made, or of the course I pursued. I consulted my noble friend at the head of the Covernment, and am convinced that I acted rightly in placing in the direction of the East India Company men who are able to carry out with vigour those schemes of improvement which aU Indian reformers press upon us, and which cannot be accomplished if the direction is aUowed to become an effete and languid body. I presume the hon. member will not press his motion, as tbe papers are private documents which he has obtained I know not whence, but which I cannot beheve, unless he teUs me so, that he has obtained from a gallant and honourable officer like Sir G. PoUock. I should be sorry to put into any paper a statement that Sir G. PoUock was removed,-which, I repeat never was done. His time of service had expired, and I did not shrink from what I beUeved to be my duty to appoint a person better quaUfied by great abilities and greater activity. (Hear, hear.) Mr. DISRAELL-When the India BUI was first submitted^to thisHouse in 18531 supported a motion of my hon. friend, then member for King's Lynn, by which that bffl would have been defeated, and I remember on that occasion we had the valuable support of the present President of the Board of Control. I thought it an ffl-conceived measure, that would not only disappoint pubUc expectation, but instead of improving tend rather to injure the administration of our Indian empire; and aU that I have observed since and all that I can calculate as to its effect i entirely confirm the opinion I then formed. I beUeve it is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs, and that the attention of ParUament must necessarily be speedily called to the subject. (Hear.) I do not doubt that now the President of the Board of Control generaUy agrees with me in these views, because I cannot suppose that his having attained, quite honourably, the high office which he holds, and the duties of which I am wüling to believe he performs with satisfaction, can in any material manner affect the opinions resulting from considerable thought and study which he then entertained. Therefore, Sir, upon th» affairs of IndU the President of the Board of Control and myself probably have many opinions in common. Though it was a minor point, I was in some degree reconcüed to the passing of the act of 1853 by the judicious manner in which the highest pabonage of the office over which the right hon. gentleman presidesnamely, the nomination of directors-was exercised by the Government. There was a general opinion that the appointments were made without «ny undue influence, and that the gentlemen chosen were the best who could beselected. A very short brae has elapsed, and we are caUed upon, under circumstances which I am sure everv gentìeman feels to be very painful? to cañ^S the propnety of a selection which then gave very generat satisfaction. I am not surprised, after what has «furred, that General PoUock wishes his case to be laid before ParUament, and I am bound to say my hon. friend has shown great spirit and Parliamentary talent in the manner in which he has brought it under the notice of the House. (Hear, hear.) In what a strange position we find ourselves to-mght! IamwiUmg to believe that the right hon gentleman (Mr. V. Smith) has acted upon the purest convictions of what he thought tobe his duty. A Minister must act on his own responsibUity ; and therighthon. gentleman has vindicated, in a manly and spirited manner, the exercise of his discretion ; but in doing so he has made an attack upon one of his coUeagues. General PoUock, a man of more than European reputation, of world-wide reputationto use the epithet ofthe President of the Board of Controlwas appointed only two years ago, with the approbation of the public, by the present First Lord of the Admiralty. If General PoUock from age and infirmity is now incapable of holding office as a director of the East India Company, why waä he appointed by the coUeague of the right hon. gentleman ? It is not possible that in two short years those abffities which gained great victories, and that nigh character which commanded general approbation, should dissolve. If Sir G. PoUock is incompetent now it was a bad appointment two years ago. But what evidence have we that he is incompetent ? (Hear, hear.) Is it to be found in the letter read to us by my hon. friend? It appeared to me to be a dignified letter, expressed in manly and proper language, by one fully equal to any position he might be called on to occupy. (Hear, bear.) I do not question the right of the President of the Board of Control to »ct on his own responsibUity, but, having no evidence before me that Sir George PoUock is not as capable as he was two years ago, I must say I deplore that he is no longer a member of the direction of the East India Company. (Cheers.) Lord PALMERSTON,-It may not be unusual for diseussions of this kind to turn on the personal merits of ia-
drriduals, but I must say it U very incorrect to describe the course of my right hon. friend as one implying anything derogatory to the high qualitiei of Sir George PoUock. (Hear, hear.) Nor does it at aU foUow that, because my right hon. friend (Mr. V. Smith) in the course of last year thought it his duty, on a comparison of qualification, to prefer anotherpeison to Sir George PoUock, my right hon. friend the First Lord of the Admiralty did not act perfectly right in the appointment of Sir G. PoUock two years ago. (Hear, hear. ) I should hope the hon. gentleman who made this motion will not place upon our records the assertion, inconsistent with fact, that Sir George Pollock was removed. My right hon. friend might have removed Sir George Pollock before the time of his service had expired. ? mj right hon. friend had done that, it would be necessary to show grave reasons for such an exercise of the Royal prerogative. But he did not do so. Sir George PoUock was placed in the direction for two years. The term having expired, it was the duty of my right hon. friend to consider the relative qualifications of different persons who might be appointed, and if, on a balance of considerations, he thought another P"?,Ä%fití?rírrJ-ageaDd other circumstlncestoX charge the duties of director it was his duty to prefer that other person. (Hear. It was no disparagement whatever wJtÄ.tarmer °l S¡r George Poïlck that Ä was preferred. (Hear, hear.) The position of official men ????1!Im u1 nP'PPointments is exceedingly difficult; but the difficulty wffl be aggravated if, when tily make the best selection according to their opinion of the candiÄírfr COndUOt i« to be caUed in question il the House of Coinmons and the House of Commons is, as it were, to make itself tue judge of the reUtive merita ol Fwn3 WT W ???°-.?? ? tU responsible officers of the Crown. I hope it wffl be clearly understood that the high Professional character of Sir George Pollock and the reputation he enjoys for the important services he has rendered ÜS^n110 v fee "^t1 dis,para«ed ?? the exercise of dkcrebon which my right hon. friend has made. (Hear, hear 1 Sir George Pollocks period of service expired, my right hon. fnend chose another person ; hut Sir George PoUock was not removed, and reaUy it would be very unfair to him PlaS.COr(CheerrT) ' ** ?°*?* *'** neVer t<>ok Oaptam VERNON said he had no wish, after the explanations which had been.given, to insist onthe word removal. With respect to the letters, it was sufficient for him, as a Bntish officer and a member of the House of Commons, to say tbat they feU into his hands, and he was willing to undertake the whole responsibUity of using them. (Hear, hear.) But, of course, if there were no other correspondence than that which he had read he had nothing to ask for, and his motion feU to the ground. The motion was then withdrawn. WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. Mr. L. DAVIES, in rising to submit to the House the necessity for legislation to prevent the gross inequaUties in tho weights and measures of the united kingdom, said that ParUament had intended to make the use of weights and measures uniform, but that the act had been inoperative in consequence of a proviso in one of the clauses The sixth cUuse in the 5th and 6th of Wffliam IV. abolished the use of aU local and customary measures, but the intention of the act was defeated by the following proviso :__" Provided always that nothing herein contained shall prevent the sale of any articles in any vessel, where such vessel is not represented ?? containing any amount of Imperial measure, or of any fixed, local, or customary measure heretofore in use." The result was that at Bedford wheat was sold at 621b. to the bushel ; at Chester, 751b. ; at Laur cesten, 621b, ; at Truro, 1401b. ; at Hereford, 601b or 801b., whUe the difference in the value of à quarter of wheat in the North Riding and at Hereford was not less than 20s. He trusted that the Government would bring in a bffl to render the law operative, and make it compulsory to seU by the imperial measure, and no othor since it was difficult, if not impossible, for a private member to pass such a measure. A great deal of discussion nad taken place on the decimal coinage, but the simple adoption of 101b. for the stone and 1001b. for the cwt. would be ????? carried out, and would do much to accustom the Ef to the advantages of decimal calculation. (Hear ear.) The hon. member concluded by moving for leave to bring m a bffl to amend the Uw reUting to weights and measure·. ? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER thought that every hon. gentleman present must concur in the Observa bons of the hon. member as to the desirableness of uniformity of weights and measures. (Hear, hear) It was one of those maxims easUy laid down, and which when laid down, commanded universal assent. But unfortunately the Legislature upon this matter often experienced its powerlessness m contending with the inveterate habits of different localities. There was hardly any spot in the rural distncts that had not its own peculiar habits in buying and selling. EachlocaUty perfectly understood its own customs, and they did not load between persons accustomed to them to uncertainty and difficulty. When the Legislature attempted to enforce one universal system ol weights and measures it was met bythe passive resistance of persons habituated to their own weights and measures lhathadbeenthereceptionefthoimperialbushelandquarter in many parts the imperial measures were used simply, in other distncts other measures were used in combination with the impenal measure. It might besuggested, indeed, whether in selling com it would not be better, on the whole, alto gether to discard measurement, and, instead of selling by the bushel or the quarter, to seU corn by weight. (Cheers. But then it must be remembered that the averages of the 1-ithe Commutation Act depended on the quarter, and that if the bushel and the quarter were discarded it would be neoessary toreform theirlegislationin thisandotherrespects Ihe decimal system wasintroduced at the French revolution Ihe introduction of those decimal weights and measures was a matter of slow progress in France, and even now was not universaUy established in aU parts of the country. I was, however, a matter weU worthy of attenbon, and he might remind the hon. gentleman (Mr. L. Davies) that the decimal coinage was now under the consideration of a com 1DI-ssl5nA W?ien, he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) re ceived the bffl of the hon. gentleman he could assure him i should receive his attentive consideration. Mr. ADDERLEY said, from first to last a great deal had been attempted but nothing material had ever been done in reference to the subject of weights and measures. A com mittee sat on the question in 1790, and three others subsequently; acta were passed upon the subject in 1824, 1826, and 1835 ; but the last-named ac had not only a loop-hole in it so large that a coach-and-six might be driven through it, but it con tained an unfortunate proviso which rendered the whol legislation upon the matter perfectly valueless. The Chan ceUer of the Exchequer said certain localities in the coun try had their own peculUr kinds of weights and measures lhat was not only so, but even in particular locaUties the vanety of weights and measures and the difference in the customs of the people were so marked as to occasion a degree of confusion exceedingly detrimental to the trade o the conntry. (Hear, hear.) WhUe aU that variety existed on the subject it was clearly the interest of the bading community at large to act on a principle of complete unison His own constituents felt the present system so detrimenta to their interests thai a short time ago they urged him to undertake some legislation on the subject, and he ftffly intended to make an attempt early in the present ses sion ; but, on seeing that the hon. member for the Cardi gan district (Mr. Lloyd Davies) had a motion on the paper he (Mr. Adderley) left the matter for the present in his hands. The hon. member had now brought the subject before the House, and he (Mr. Adderley) hoped he would not rebx in his efforts to carry his measure in spite of the poor encouragement he had received from the Chan ceUor of the Exchequer. After all, it was not so large a measure as the ChanceUor of tha Exchequer supposed.tnd he thought the hon. member himself (Mr. L. DaVies) rather travelled out of the record when he sought to mix it up with the question of the decimal coinage. What he (Mr Adderley) understood to be wanted was a far simpler thing,-namely, that the standards of weights and measures and the lineal standards in this country should be laid down by law, and should be intelUgible to everybody and im peratively uniform. (Hear, hear.) Besides the short comings of the existing law, the penalties imposed by it were such tbat they were seldom or never likely to be enforced, and, indeed, there was no adequate ma chinery for enforcing them ; so tbat practically tho law was almost inoperative. However simple tho proposal of the htn. member (Mr. L. Davies) was, it was nevertheless one which could only stand a fair chance of being carried with the assistance of the Government, and he (Mr. Adderley trusted it wonld meet with their best consideration. Mr. M'C ANN said the proposition before the House was not capable of being carried so easUy as the hon. mem ber (Mr. Adderley) seemed to think. The greatest diversity of practice prevailed throughout the kingdom in reference to weights and measures. It was difficult to wean people from old customs. In London, for example, corn of aU kinds was sold by measure, while in Liverpool everything was sold by weight. If it could bo arranged that all dry goods should be sold by weight all over the kingdom, and all liquids by measure, the thing desired would be very easy of accomplishment and inteUigible to every person. It was not worth whUe to make a change here and a change there unless a grand change was made all over the country, and that, in his opinion, should be the introduction of one uniform decimal sy>tem. Mr. L. DAVIES in reply said, he hoped tie ChanceUor of the Exchequer would introduce a measure making it imperative to sell corn by weight If the nght hon. gentlemanwouldnotdoso he should bring a proposition before the House to carry out that object. Mr. ROEBUCK said, the question now before the House was not whether corn should be sold by weight orby measure, but whether there ought not to bo a uniformity of measures. The Legislature ought to get rid of irregularity in weights and measures, butit ought not to command people to do a thing in a certain way when they were tha best judges of how it ought to be done. vJÜÎ' ?Ä.SS^d-' îhe. ??,? varied so much in different T,1~nn»nH,StnCt,lÍthwMoh he was connected that he tation»lirn-lyTaWe-to nnderstand the meaning of quodlAîIv m a.ÍT müe8 of ?? own manufactory, ani he ttemeantn<ll?tllata48eítleni!in in the house could teU whert faSSuLî f rneat in England, of a barrel of «mrftn^»n 2? ?? °- 0f a boU of *heat in Scotland.

THE PRINCIPALITIES. fn^rdoo^^MKLT0iir moved that an address be presented F,"~r^^°i 'he. treaty concluded by His Majesty the tZi???? ^'^Yh the Sublime Porte, on the 14th the ? \?· 4atlle to the mUitary occupation of ÍbLfT P illt,eS ,°.f M"ldavia and Wallachia. His AánveÍn^^íH^'0^011 was to caU the attention of the Government to the fact that no treaties however important they might be, and however they Ä affelt the interests of Great Britain, appeared in the volume of Ä Popers published every year, except those to which Her ilajesty s naine was attached as one of the high contracting Powers. Copies of other treaties could only Se obtained by the cumbrous process of a motion for an addres*. He had
selected this treaty because it was one still in operation, »nd because Her ^Majesty*! Government was to a certain extent a party to it, inasmuch as a distinct allusion to it was made in the second article of the beaty signed at Vienna in 1851. The pnncipaUties at the present moment occupied the attention of a commission ; their form of government was a subject of discussion, and to sbong was tho difference of opmion which prevailed on thia point that he had read bat to-day, in a letter from one of those intelligent correspondents whose letters appeared in the London journals, tbatAustnawassaidiobe prepared to resist by f orce the junction ofthe principaUties. AU these things rendered it desirable that this treaty should be readUy accessible in the library of the House, as the course of events would probably lead to frequent references to it. The noble lord concluded by moving the address of whioh he had given notice. Lord PALMERSTON observed that the particular treaty referred to had already been laid before ParlUment, and it would only be putting the public to additional expense to reprint it. With regard to the general question raised by the noble lord, it was undoubtedly proper that Parliament ehould be made acquainted with aU beaties containing engagements with the British Crown ; but with regard to engagements entered into by other Powers between themselves the Government had no official knowledge, and such treaties were not laid before ParUament because they did not bear on any action of the British nation. ? · ·£"* Particular treaty were concluded between two foreign Powers, which by its nature was thought to bear in some degree on the policy of England, then, if any member moved for its production, the Secretary oi State applied to the contracting Powers for an official copy, which was laid before Parliament. He apprehended that tbe noble lord desired some arrangements to be made by which all international documents of interest should bo coUected and placed in the library. That might be done, no doubt, if Parliament desired it, and assigned a sufficient remuneraT to some responsible person for performing the duty ; but it was a question for the House itself to determine. Under the direction of the Foreign-office there was a particular coUection made and printed for sale, containing not only treaties, but aU European documents of interest. There was a volume of these for each year. This work was undertaken some years ago, and was continued backwards and forwards from the period of its commencement, and a large number of volumes had been published. «LWa! aw°rK of great labour and required great research, the documents being coUected from every source. The work was in the hands of a very inteUigent gentleman. Ôn w J F lt weDt' > believed it might be relied on for perfect accuracy. He had only to repeat that if the thlHon« ». rnternational interest, that was a matter whioh the House itself must determine. tb^"£ISPvAELï aaîdthat in tho Ubrary of the house ÎSfJlWf?i.manZ,dîcnn,e.nts of international interest, but he ÏZntîi*1^ ? maklDK his mo«on.

(Hear, hearJ What had fallen from the noble lord at the nead of the Government was apart from the question. The coUection that fa T IP " ^"l every respect satisfactory, except that it was always m a state of great arrear.

(Hear.) The motion was then withdrawn. BANK ACTS. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER roseto move the appointment of the Committee on the Bank Acts. He said-I wffl trouble the House with a few remark reUting to the nature of the committee I propose to appoint -namely, a Committee of Secresy. The actual difference between an ordinary committee and a committee of secresy is not, m fact, very wide. It is competent for a select committee-and it often exercises the power-to exclude the pubUcduring thereceptionof evidence. AU select committees exclude the public during their deliberations, which constitute the only part of their proceedings of which an authentic ??£ 4 \ 8h°rthand writer is not preserved. To a committee of the sort I now propose it is not probable that the pubhc would be admitted during the examinabon of witnesses; but a complete report of the evidence would be taken, and the committee would have the power of laying it on the table of the house. The only difference between a select committee, not admitting the pubUo during the examinabon of witnesses, and a committee of secrecy is this-that it is the privilege of members not belonging to the committee to be present at an ordinary select committee. « they so think fit, whUe the public are excluded. But, if the committee be a committee of secresy, then members unconnected with the committee have not thatpnvüege. That is the whole extent of the difference. In looking through the series of committees appointed to inquire mto the Bank charter and other questions of a simiUr nature, I find it to have been the invariable practice to constitute them committees of secresy. In 1819 the committee on the expediency of the Bank resuming cash payments was a secret committee. In J832 a secret committee was appointed to inquire into tho expediency of renewing the Bank charter. In 1836 the committee on joint-stock banks was also secret, and the committee on commercial distress in 1848 was Ukewise a committee of secresy. With respect to the arrangements between the Government and the Bank of England there is nothing which, as far as I am aware, might not be published to the whole world, and, as far as Government is concerned there is no reason to wish that any departure should Sol ?? lTZm£e usual ^? of exammationincommittee. But theHouse must be aware that, in a committee ot this sort, questions may arise affeoting the oredit of particular commercial estabUhments, with respect to which it lni f w *? desirable that any pubUcity should occur; and that, I apprehend, is the principal reason why this course has been invariably pursued with reKl"M ,>mlltteea 0ft this k¡nd. Therefore I have thought it desirable to adhere to what seems to have been the invariable practice, and I propose that this should be a committee of secreay. With respect to the members of tho committee, it has been rr.y studv to propose as fair a Ust of names as possible, and one which would insure a complete and searching investigation of the ??????110 the committee. I think th! ???? will IrlL ? ? ?? are scarcely any discussions so disagreeable to the feelings as those which arise with respect to the preference of one member to another for aptoinWt on a committee, and if the House should bl of opinion that, on the whole, the Ust I propose rftber^«^1 *T* -ní' ^th0Ut gobS &t0 the mlrits of other members it wffl be disposed to adopt the list I sub. ???>?^°£??^???7??? hon· meTte£ for wãllinrford w^nh?hT^ÍLÍfaHns and ??· StirlingJ-have^ti mated their inability to serve on the committee, and I shall therefore give notice of a motion to substitute twoTotner nan»* instead of theirs.

The last-me£ boned gentleman, indeed, had almost deluged the country llíÄll·'7 °f Pamphlets, articles, and publications which he had issued on this subject during the last 14 years. Un looking at the names that composed the committee he 1 « \f cî??ok?) «und one or two members of what ho nii»ht call tbe Birmingham school, and he found one or two'of what he might caU the Overstone school. He found the names of some members who, he believed, had never expressed any opinion on this subject, if, indeed, they entertamed any. But he did not find a singlo momber of what he might call tho school of economists, which had the very high authonty of Messrs. Tooke, FuUerton, and \\ ihren. _ Ho listened to a great portion of the not very lively or instructive debate on this subjeot the other evenine and of ?? portion which he had not tho feltcity of hearing he read a report the next day. He found that during thl Zrl°S ?!¿fbateíh?,re wae "?? »ne hon. gentleman who broached doctrines at aU approaching to that school. That hon. gentleman, who was thehon.member for Wick Burghs (Mr. Laing), ¡moke most ably, but his name was not on thé committee. Perhaps, however, he (Mr. Peacocke) might be told, as he had been reminded by his right hon. friend the member f or Buckinghamshire, that the name of the hon. member for Westbury (Mr. James Wilsor,) was upon the committee; but he must take the Uberty of asking whether he was a WUsoniteflanghter), for he was probabl? no more a Wilsonite than Wilkes was a WUkite. He (Mr Peacocke) was rather inclined to believe that the hon. member for Westbury was inclined, Uke Wilkes, to repudiate his disciples, and he therefore begged to ask whether it was really his intention to take his place upon tho committeeand, if he should do so, whether he would do so as the author of Capital- and Currency, or as the Secretary for the Treasury ; because, with the single exception of the hon. gentleman himself, there was no representative of the school of which ho was once the apostle but of which he (Mr. Peacocke) believed he was no longer a disciple. (Laughter.) If there was one question more than another to which the attention of the committee ought to be directed it was that of country issues On looking over the debate of the other evening he found that that subject was aUuded to by only one gentleman,viz., his hon. friend the member for Inverness-shire. But that bon. gentleman's name was not on the committee. There was another most important point. He believed that it was a very general opinion that it was the intention of the Bank Act that tho buUion in tho issue department ????.'??? exclusively for the purpose of securing the convertibility of the note, and that the holder nf . banknote should have a special lien upon it. Now. if the Bank should break, was the holder of EU!?-l*on°mt toxL Ç*,id Pari P"*5" with every other creditor? That the ChanceUor of the Exchequer must admit was a very important question for tho consideration of the committee, but not one of those hon. gentlemen whose names had been proposed had aUuded to it. And yet he (ilr. Peacocke) was told that this wan a fair and impartial committee for the purposes of inquiry He it ? »? ?????? any alteration of it.

MELANCHOLY DPIATH.-Yesterday morning, upoa the arrival of Mr. Long at the court to attend to his duties, information was communicated to him by Mr. Smith, one of the officer3, of the death of AIr. Felt, chief clerk, which took place that morning at his residence1 2, Camden-street north, Camden-town, to the great regret of aU to whoL he was known. The comnunication to the worthy magistrate was received with much seonation, as he had filled th.e office to which he was attached for a period of about 50 years. He was highly esteemed by the magistrates of the court, as the duties devolved upon himi were always performed with assiduity, and the depositions forwarded by him to the Central Criminal Court aDd the other courts were always to the entire satisfaction of the judges. He was the senior clerk of the police court. He was in the 65th year of hlis age.
MIR. JAMES SAKDLEIR, M.P.-Copies of Yhe several warrants issued for the apprehension of Air. Jamhes Sadleir, 31.P., and of the reportson the steps taken for his arrest, and the proceedings in the process of outlawry against him, have jnst been published by order of Parliament. Both the police and the bailiffs have been at fault. Five warrants were issued in Tipperary in July last, and searches made on 11 occasions at his (Sadleir's) own residence (Clonaeody) and eleewloro, but without succe3s. It was reported to the Governn,cnt in Septembiher lastS that M1r. Janies Sadleir was supposed to be then secreted in the county Meath, at the house of a Mtr. Delanyv, J.P., Of Grenalston.

London, Friday, February 13, 1857.
LONDOZY, FRIDAY, PEBRUARY 13, 1857.
In the House of Lords iast night,
Lord CAREuINDON, in reply to Lord Crl<&fiCARDS, explained the circumstances which had led during the war to the occupation, and which, now that war had ceased, would lead to the evacuation of Greece iby the aUies.
The Marquis of SALISBURY moved for a Select Committee to inquire into the subject of secondary punishnients.
Lord GR.ANVILLE opposed the motion, on the ground that the House was not yet in possession 4of the plan proposed by Govermnent, and that amtil the I louse had arrived at soine definite notion of the subject-matter of the proposed inquiry, it -would be useless to appoint the commuittee.
Lord ST.AxHOPE, -who had moved the appointment of a siiiiilar committee last year, thought that the time for deliberation was past and that for action come. He hoped, therefore, that Lord SALIsIUrtY would not press his motion until he had heard the Govelrnent plan.
The Earl of CAIRNARVON could not admit that the plan proposed in the other House was a perfect measure.
Lord CA1PB1ELL agreed with Lord STANHOPE in
thinking that this was the time for action and not for deliberation. In his opinion transportation was the only piiniishment whichi aflorded a reasonable chance for the reformation of criminals, and he hoped the Govsrnment would direct their attention especially to the continuation of that panishment.
Afer some further discussion, in which Lords
FITz)IIuAMLa, DTNGARVON, and RAVENSWORTH took
part, the mlotlon was negatived without a division.
Some other business was then despatched, after swhich their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons, in reply to Mr. STAFFORD,
Sir R. PErL frankly acknowledged that he did mnake the speech at Saltby, on the 7th of January, which wa;s reported in this journal, and, although it was dificult, he said, to pledge himself to the precise accur4cy of everything contained in the report, he had such confidence in the fidelity of the reporter that he was ready to accept the responsi bity, except as to one particilar phrase, repudiating anjy word prejudicial to the character of M. MomsNY. If he had erred (although he did not feel that he had erred), he begged to offer the most ample expressions of regret, and the most fitting amende hunorable.
Lord PALVERSTO?f, referring to the explanation which had teJcen place on Tuesday night, regarding the conventiln of 1854, said he wished to set himself right with Mr. DisA LITupon that subject. He had then said that the convention wvas never signed; but upon further inquiry he found that, in point of fact, it had been signed, but. it being more of a military than of a political character, the object being to reulatethe relations of the French and -Austrian troops in Italy in the contingency of Austria declaring war against Russia, and Austria never having declared war, the convention, though signed, became a dead letter.
Mr. DiSRAELI recapitulated what, he alleged, he had stated, and which, he observed, had been pronounced a romance, and he IIow re-asserted that
there was a treaty, a secret treaty, between France and Austria, the object of which was to guarantee the Italian possessions of Austria; that it was not only signed, but extensively acted upon; that there was no limitation of its action, and that the account given by Lord PAIHHItSTON the other night was entirely incorrect.
Lord PALMEnSTON observed that MfIr. DisiiAzLf s statement was that there was a treaty between Austria and France guaranteeing the Italian possessions of Austria, which was now in existence, and that this treaty had been concluded at the instigation of the English Government. He (Lord PAIBLmRsToS) had denied this, and be still denied it. No such treaty ever was concluded with the cognizance of the English Government. To the best of his belief, he said, Mr. DISBAELI had been imposed upon in this matter.
Mr. NAPIER moved an address praying HER MAJnrrTY to take into consideration, as an urgent measure of administrative reform, the formation of I separate and responsible department for the affairs of public justice. He cited authorities in favour of such a measure, and urged that it would be a complement to the other meditated legal reforms, while it would give to the profession of the law a better position. Call it a Mifnistry of Justice, or by any other name, but let there be a separate department. He discussed the objections to the proposal, one of wvhich was the expense; but he did not think the people of this .conntry would grudge any expense for such an object. He admitted that there were difficulties to be encountered, but they were not insuperable, and he claimed the aid of the Government.
The motion was seconded by Mr. COLLIER, who attributed the evils of our present legal system to the system itself, no high officer having a staff capable of dealing with those evils, far less of exercising the functions which should be given to a department of justice, of which he sketched an outline.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL said in accepting, with a slight modification, the resolution proposed by Mr. NAVPLER, it must be understood that the Government did not recognize as a consequence of adopting the resolution the establishment of a separate Minister of Justice. He did not consider at present that there was any necessity for the appointment of such an officer; he thought that alu the objects might be carried out by the existing machinery; that it would be impossible to introd ice into the Cabinet a Minister of Justice while the LOD C011ANCEI.OR was there; and that it was perfectly within the power of that officer, if aided by a sufficient staff, offectually to superintend the administration of justice, and the contemplatedreforms in certain of its branches. If the words " as an urgent measure of administrative reform" be omitted, he would not resist the motion, which would not be a mere barren resolution.
Lord J. RUSSELL said the speech of the ATToNEY-Em GENERAL consisted of two parts; one was a very powerful argument in favour of Mr. NAPFRs's proposition; the other was eminentlv unsatisfactory, and he had not stated the views of the Government upon the subject, but his own. Instead of a responsible Minister of Justice, he had proposed that the LORD CHANCELLOR should have the assistance of a staff. But he (Lord JoHN) did not think that the LORD CHANCELLOR would have sufficient time at his disposal for the function of superintendence to be given to him. He hoped the words in the resolution proposed to be left out would be retained.
Mr. KEAThNG likewise hoped that the ATTronEyGENERAL would not create a difference of opinion by insisting upon the withdrawal of those words, which made little difference in the frame of the proposition. He agreed that the legitimate head of the department of public justice was the LORD CHANCELLOR, who was in natural connexion with all the legal functionaries and tribunals.
The ATToRNEY-GENERAL said, as the omission of the words might be thought to impair the effect of the resolution, which was not intended, the Government would not object to their being retained.
Some general and discursive remarks were made by Mr. WIGRAM, Mr. W. EwART, Sir E. PERRY, Mr. M. CHlAMBERS, Mr. MALINS, Mr. KING, and
Mr. WARREN.
Lord PALMERSTON, in agreeing with the motion to give effect to the principles embodied in the resolution, that efforts should be made to adopt departmental arrangements to promote reforms in the law, observed that the debate showed that, with regard to any particular system of improvement, it was impossible for the Government to give any pledge. He thought that before the House consented to copy foreign models and created a new officer, who must be a lawyer, must abandon his profession, and resign his office with the change of Uovemnment, it was right to see whether the object might not be accomplished by attaching this department to some existing officer. It would be the duty of the Government to give their earnest attention to the subject.
After some observations by Mr. HADFIELD and a reply by Mr. NArivE., the motion was agreed to.
Sir W. CLAY moved for leave to bring in a bill for the abolition of church-rates, the bill to be limited to the total abolition of such rates, and a provision saving existing legal obligations.
Mr. SPOONER inquired whether the Government meant to give their support to a measure for the total abolition of church-rates.
Mr. LABOUCHEir replied that Sir GEOrGE GREY had already stated that the Government had no intention to introduce any measure upon the subject, and when the bill for the introduction of which leave was now asked stood for a second reading, they would state the course they proposed to take.
Captain L. VER.NON moved for copies of aU correspondence relating to the removal of General POLLOCK from the direction of the East Tndia Company. After eulogizing Sir GEORGE's military career during the Affghan war, and stating that, as a recog"nition of his services, he was in 1854 nominated one of the three Government directors of the East India Company, for two years, he complained that at the expiration of his term of office he was not reappointed, according to the ful expectation of Sir GEORGE, upon the plea that a fresh appointment, and not a re-appointment, should be the rule.
Mr. V. SAIITH said his answer to the motion was simply this,-that there was no official correspondence as to the non-reappointment of Sir GEORGE POLLOCK, and that he never was removed from his office. He concurred with Captain VERNON- in his estimate of the military services of that distinguished officer, but his public duty required that he should not reappoint him when his term had expired; and he never felt greater pain than in the fulhlinent of that duty in this instance, although he did everything to save the feelings of Sir GEoRGE POLLOCK(.
Mr. DISRAELI observed that the speech of Mr. Surrhl was an implied attack upon his colleague and predlecessor at the Board of Control (Sir (J. WOOD), who appointed Sir G. POLLOCE. If that officer was incapable through infirmity of holding the office of director, why was he appointed?
Lord PALMERSTON said it was a misrepresentation to describe the course taken by Mr. SsreIH as de-
rogatory to the merits and high qualities of Sir G. POLLOC1, nor did it follow that Sir C. WOOD did not do right in appointing him two years ago.
The motion was withlrawn.
Mr. LLOYD DAVIES submitted the necessity for legislation to prevenit the gross inequalities in the
weights and measures of the united kingdom, and moved for leave to introduce a bill to amend the act 5 and 6 WILLIAMS IV.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXcHEQuER observed that uniformity of weights and measures, however desirable, was a difficult object, it being obstructed by the inveterate habits of different localities. The bill, when introduced, should receive the attention of the Government.
After a few words from Mr. ADDERLEY, Mr.
M'CANN, Mr. toiBmUCK, Mr. BAss, and Mr. MYCHELL, leave was given.
Lord C. HAMnLTON, in moving for a copy of the treaty concluded by the Emperor of AuSTRIA with the SUBLInEE PORTE, on the 14th of June, 1854, relative to the military occupation of the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, complained that copies of such treaties, in which lssw 3fYIAJEsTY's name did not appear, though recognized by our Government, were not printed, unless on motion.
Lord PALsrnsTo said the treaty referred to had been already printed; and with regard to engagements between foreign Powers, generally speaking, the Government. Lad no official knowledge of them. If any such treaky be upo tha L policy of EnglandL
application was made to the foreign Government for a copy, which was laid before Parliament.
The motion was, after some remarks by Mr. DiSRu.Au, withdrawn.
The CHANcELLoR of the ExCHuElnt moved that the Committee upon the Bank Acts be a committee of secrecy, and do consist of 22 membera. It had been the practice to make such committees secret, althouge, as far as the Govermnent was concerned, they had no motive to desire secrecy.
Before the committee was nominated,
Mr. PEACOCKE objected to its constitution.
Mr. DMIRAELI suggested that, as the Government had made up their minds, it would be better to have no committee, but to introduce a bill; and that if a committee was appointed it should not exceed 11.
The CnANCELLOn of the ExCRXQuER justified the course of appointing a committee, and the number he had proposed.
The motion was agreed to, and the committee was nominated, after some discussion.
The Commons Enclosure Bill and the Royal Marine Forces Bill were read a second time.
The House adjourned at 12 o'clock.

Mr. DISRAELI has had what he appears to con-
Mlr. DISRAELI has had what he appears to consider an immense success in the admitted fact that a convention was actually signed between France and Austria. It is impossible to say how much follows from this simple circumstance. Because something was signed between France and Austria relating to the affairs of Italy, therefore France guaranteed to Austria, against all the world, then, now, and for ever, the security of the Austrian possessions in Italy, and the perpetual existence of every despotic institution in the Peninsula. If anything was signed it must have been a treaty; that treaty must still be in force, and it must guarantee the status quo for ever. That is the lofty superstructure raised by MIr. DISRAELI on that slender foundation. It is nothing less than an Italian policy; a perpetual settlement of the various interests concerned in Italy, made expressly between France and Austria, and withl the cognizance, and, indeed, by the advice, of England. Here, then, are the three great Powers of Western and Central Europe committed to keep Italy for ever as it is; to extinguish all Liberalism and other temptation to revolt ; to bind the North-Eastern States closer to Austria; to repress the visionary ambition of Sardinia; to secureRome from tribunes, and torivet the BOURBONS on Naples and Sicily. No doubt, with so portentous a docutment inthearchives of Vienna, it was only natural that Austria should feel henceforth more easy with her neighbour in Piedmont; and that the King of NAPLEs should feel perfectly tranquil with volcanoes, magazines, and stilettoes around him, and a British fleet in the ofling. So potent a spell would prevail against a thousand menaces, against sedition within and intervention without; againstMAzzTNs, PAL31EPsroN, and the fugitive Triumvirs of Rome. But it was not so natural; on the contrary, it was ridiculous and disgraceful ;-and Mr. DisRAELI was perfectly right in assigning this force to the document he described,-that England and even France should stiUl vapour about Italian liberty, and pretend to advise the King of NAPLES, or have anything to do with the Italian Governments, except in the way of confidence and sympathy.
Unfortunately for Mr. DisRALI, it remains to be shown that there is such a document; and the fact that something has been signed does not prove the signature of anything else that one may please to imagine. Certainly, ingenious or captious politicians of a particular school might allege an inconsistency,-as, indeed, they have alleged, in England, France, and Austria having anything to do with one another, considering their respective characters and the lines they take south of the Alps. An inconsistency might be alleged in their Plenipotentiaries even sitting in one room together for any one purpose, if only to arrange a tariff, or a postal convention, or a system of quarantine, or a resistance to a barbaric irruption, were it possible in these days. Because south of the Alps England is one thing, Austria is another, and France is neither quite one nor the other, therefore north of the Alps, in the absence of the matter inl dispute, the three Powers have no choice but to sulk and suffer any extremity rather than help one another, or do anything together. It would have been quite out of the question that Austria should co-operate with the WVestern Powers, or rather do worse than cooperate, bes" the brunt of a deadly collision with a colossal foe, unless she were secured meantime from her old danger, revolt and revolution in her rear. Such contingencies, and aU the dangers arising from them, could only be covered by a general agreement to maintain the status quo while Austria was so engaged. Even for that armed neutrality, which Austria did in effect observe ;- even for the army of observation on her Russian frontier, and the occupation of the Danubian provinces, she required immense forces, that could not have been spared for the purpose had italy been at all disturbed. All these are military, not political, considerations. They belong to the war, and they end with the war. But they required such an understanding as that in question; and whether that understanding was embodied in a document, written and signed, or what was its form, signifies nothing at all; for, had there been no such document, the honourable understanding would have still been the same, even when t-wo such natural antagonists as Austria and Sardinia were concerned. That there was a convention for that special and temporary purpose, and that it was actually signed, is, it appears, the fact; but it is a very trifling addition to the necessary and notorious understanding on the subject. It is no approach at all, not one step, not one inch of progress, towards the treaty imagined by Mr. DIsBAELI, and the present potency of which, he says, is such as to give the King of NAPLES the countenance of Austria, France, and England against England herself ;-the countenance of English diplomacy against English opinion; the countenance of a secret treaty recognized by England against naval demonstrations and Parliamentary rhetoric.
If there is such a thing as a treaty between France and Austria, virtually comprehending England as the suggester and adviser, guaranteeing to Austria her Italian possessions, and involving in the guilt of treachery every interference by England or France of a nature to weaken the hold of Austria or her influence in Italy, then let Mr. DispuAELI just ask the kind friends who have got him into this scrape to get him out of it. They must know something of the treaty, and it must be for the interest of Austria that it be known. Indeed, on the hypothesis, it is known already to Naples. N othing, then, can be easier than to produce the very letter of the document, wllich will at once settle the question between Mr. DISRAELI a!d Lord PALRTON, and a good many other questions besides. It is difficult indeed to say how long the virtue of advice or connivance is to last. Signatures to a treaty last till they are effaced by another treaty or the rude hand of war. But how long is England to be bound by a suggestion volunteered by a Prime Minister to a foreign Power ? The obligation must, at all events, remain upon the Government that contracted it as long as the
circumstances endure, as they still do in the case . supposed by Mr. DssnAEir. It is, then, no trifling F inconsistency that he imagines, and we only wonI der that, ta wae hia own language) he, ha4
not expressed even more indignation at a Government thus tightening the bonds of despotism under the mask of freedom. But we wait till lIr. DISRAELI has produced the text of the treaty, or can speak less doubtingly as to its contents. Till he has done so we stil remain in the belief that England is altogether free in respect of Italy, or, at least, under no obligation except that which by this time has the tradition of a long period, to advise in favour of free institutions and constitutional government. We shall believe we are still free to tender this advice tin it can be proved in the face of the world that we are the sworn friends of absolutism.

When the Estimates were talked about at the
When the Estimates were talked about at the opening of the debates, and prospective reductions had been attractively displayed before the eyes of the public, Mr. GLADSTONE observed, with a rigorous exercise of vigilance, that he must look, not at what was taken away, but at what was lef' -not at how much we professed to be saving, but at how much we were still purposing to spend. Perhaps some people thought this rather hard and ungracious, but it was sound economy nevertheless; and we now propose to analyze the Navy Estimates on the principles thus laid down. With more than 17,000,0001. to be undoubtedly knocked off from last year's outlay, and with a most agreeable remission of taxation in prospect, a good many persons, we dare say, would be disposed to indulge in gratulations without much further inquiry; but here is the bill for the forthcoming year actually before us, and such an account deserves careful scritiny.
The standard by which MIr. GLADSTONE proposed to measure the figures of the Estimates was one to be extracted from " the real necessities of " the country," and he proceeded to explain this view a little further by saying that he should refer to " our experience before the war ;" or, in other words, as we suppose, that he should compare the forthcoming Estimates, not with those for years of war, but with those for years of peace. In a general sense this proposition was sound. The war standard should, no doubt, be discarded altogether, but it does not necessarily follow that the true measure to be employed-that of the " real " necessities of the country," would allow of a naked and unqualified comparison between the figures of 1857 and those of years antecedent to the war. As Mr. GI.sToNX himself remarked,
we may now wish to improve much that existed " before the war, and many of those improvements "cannot be carried on without expense"-an admission of the very principle laid down by the PitmntR, that it is important to utilize the experience recently acquired. Moreover, we have stil some work on hand in Persia and China, and it is only in the former of these cases tha' the required armaments are furnished from India. However, we may assume as a doctrine to start from that the scale of the last two years should be put out of the question, and that we should form our conclusions by the aid of earlier Estimates, with such modifications as our present and actual condition may fairly suggest. We wiUl take, therefore, for contrast with the figures before us, two periods closely following each other, but of very different characters-that of February, 1854, when war, though not yet developed, was looming largely in the horizon, and the same month of 1853, when it was not anticipated at all.
How little the original Estimates of 1854 were based upon the expectation of our actual Crimean campaigns may be inferred from the single fact that the vote asked for conveyance of troops (which reached in the end to nearly 5,000,0001.) was only 225,0501., being but an increase of some 70,0001. on the year preceding. The principal augmentation at that time was in the number and charge of seamen and marines, which exceeded, in fact, the vote now proposed. To put the case concisely and in an intelligible shape, we may observe that the figures of the Navy Estimates in any year depend upon two great principles of policy, which govern between them six important votes. The first concerns the scale on which the personal department of the navy is to be maintained, and this, of course, regulates the pay and subsistence of seamen and marines. The second relates to the material deparmnent, and determines the amount to be expended upon establishments at heme and abroad, artificers' wages, stores of allkinds for dockyard nurposes, and works and improvements in those yards themselves. Now, a person looking at the respective circumstances of 1854 and 1857 would probably be led to conclude that our seamen and marines would be fewer and less costly in the present year than at the former period, but that, as many improvements were suggested during the war, our material department might possibly cost us somewhat more. And this is precisely the real state of the case. In 1854 our proposed expenditure under the former head (we mean as first estimated in February) was 3,062,9951., whereas for the present year it is 2,983,2551. UInder the latter head, however, we have 3,089,2851. for 1857, against 2,590,0291. for 1854. Proceeding to a closer analysis of the former of these votes, we find that in 1854 there were required 41,000 " seamen to be employed in " HF MAJExTy's fleet," 2,000 " boys," and 15,500 " Royal Marines." In the Estimates now before us 31,000 " officers, seamen, and " boys to be employed in HER iVAJESTY'S fleet" are asked for, with 2,000 more for " surveying, troop, " and store ships ;" and 5,700 more for " Coast" guard service and cruisers." The demand for Marines is only 500 less than in 1854, being stiU 15,000-a fact to which few persons, considering the eminently serviceable character of that corps, are likely to take objection. We wiU now ascend to the year 1853.
The first thing striking us in the Estimates of 1853 is that thesupply of seamen "to be employed "C in HEB MAjESfy's fleet" is identically the same with that now proposed-viz., 31,000-though the Marines show smaler numbers, being only 12,500. To this, however, should be added a provision of no great extent (38,6001.) made for a naval reserve. Altogether the charge for this personal section of the Estimates amounts, for 1853, to 2,351,6621., against the present Estimate of 2,983,2551. It isin thematerial department that the chief excess of 1857 is shown, for whereas this was covered four years ago by 2,156,1671., we are now asked, as before specified, for some three miUions. We have given these sums in the gross by compounding the several votes in order to facilitate comparisons, and we will now add the still broader results to be obtained from the juxtaposition of the totals for the three years referred to. We stiU, however, confine ourselves to what is termed the " effective service " of the Navy, discarding not merely the non-effective
branch, but even the charge for conveyance of troops. As contrasted, then, with1854, ourpresent :Estimates show an increase of 604,8541.; as contrasted with 1853, of 1,821,2801.
With the desire of making these deductions as broad and as comprehensive as possible, we have abstained from entering into- the several items out of which the aggregate for the present year is made up, and a few of these particulars are now, therefore, subjoined. We may say briefly that thore is a decrease presented (tbh standard of comparison is now the Estin of May, 18566 under every aingle b.cead of lfi- eff1tiye and. non-
effective services, with the exception of the halfpay and retirement charges, and a small addition of 4,1091. to the expenses of the scientific branch of the service. The largest reduction is in naval stores-upwards of a million and a-half; the next in the pay of seamen and marines452,5891., with a corresponding decrease for their victuals of 333,4161. To obtain the grand total of the reductions announced we must add to the 2,964,0201. described above as being saved upon the effective service for the year the large sum of 4,758,9181. retrenched from the transport service, by which that item is reduced, exactly as Mr. GLADSTONE hoped, to " altogether " insignificant proportions"-in fact, to 207,0001. in place of nearly five mnllions. After this, if we allow for the introduction of the Coastguard, voted last year in the revenue estimates, and deduct a small balance of increase on the non-effective service, we shall find that the sum total of the expenditure on the Navy is estimated to cost us 8,188,9871. less for the ensuing year than it was computed at even in May, 1856.

The satisfactory settlement of the questions
The satisfactory settlement of the questions relating to the Danubian Principalities cannot but be endangered by such an imprudent manifesto as appeared a few days since in the Moniteur. NVe should be willing to believe that to haste, or thoughtlessness, or the indiscretion of some official personage, was due the publication of this veryindiscreet article; but the appearance of similar arguments in other journals which commonly represent the opinions of the French Government leaves no doubt that the Imperial Cabinet not only desires the union of the Principalities, but thinks fit to announce its wishes for the purpose of ilfluencinig the deliberations of the Moldo-Wallachians themselves. The result of such a step might have been expected. Lord CLARESIDON, in answer to Lord LYNDHURST on Monday night, did not hesitate to say that he had read the article in the Moniteur with surprise, since at the tinie of the Congress of Paris an understanding had been come to by the representatives of the Great Powers that, until the Divans had met, until the Commissioners had made their report, and the Congress had assembled to consider it, no one of the Powers would do anything to influence opinion in the Principalities or elsewhere on this question. An avowedly official article, proclaiming the desire of the French Government to unite the provinces, its intention to impress its wishes on the other Powers, and its hope of gaining for its views a majority in the Conferences which are to come, is certainly as plain a breach of the former understanding as can well be conceived. So the representatives of Austria and Turkey, as well as Lord CLARENDON, seem to have thought, and it is said that explanations have been asked respecting the sudden and peremptory manifesto of the French Government. While the several Cabinets are corresponding on the subject we may take the opportunity once more to call attention to the state of the regions which, though the immediate cause of the late war, have now been almost forgotten by all but professed politicians.
The pretext with which Russia covered her designs of aggrandisement used to be, as we aU know, the deliverance of the oppressed Christians from Mussunlman thraldom. By this the CZAR induced Europe to acquiesce in his protectorate of the Principalities. Four years ago the most far-seeing politician would have confessed that, in his opinion, MIoldavia and WaUachia must, before many years, be brought under the direct dominion of Russia. The Russians had crossed the Pruth whenever they chose, and remained as long as seemed good to them. The native authorities had been suspended or superseded at the pleasure of the protectors, and any person hostile to the Russian supremacyi had been speedily driven from the country. In fact, the late C7AP. looked upon the country as virtually his own, and in the summer of 1853 thought that the time had come to convert an actual into a legal sovereignty. How nearly this arrogant confidence was justified by the result we well know. Now that Russia has been defeated in a great war people may be inclined to under-estimate the danger which Europe escaped, but a little reflection on the events of 1853 will convince them that but for the firmness of the Western Powers, aided by a concurrence of circumstances which may not again take place, the Russians might have made themselves masters of one of the finest tracts of Europe, containinc 5,000,000 of people, commanding the Danube during the greater part of its navigable course, and overlapping the eastern provinces of Austria, so as to bring that empire into a state of complete military dependence. To prevent such a catastrophe England and France went to war and Austria occupied the disputed provinces. Evidently the object of Europe now must be to prevent the recurrence of such an invasion. How, then, shall it be prevented? Surely, by the means that were found successful on the last occasion. In 1854 the Russians retired becauise a Turkish army was in their front, the Austrians on their flank, and the French and English ready to march to reinforce these two armies. Any scheme for the settlement of the Principalities must, therefore, be such as wil not prevent the free military action of the PoRTE in the country, and the right of the SULTAEN to call in the aid of the three great Powers which are interested in his support.
Now, the wish of Russia natiurally is to weaken the connexion between Turkey and those outlying provinces. Russia cares nothing about the Rouman nation, and in the old times, when she looked upon the whole country as a sure prize, any patriot who should have suggested the union of the Principalities would soon have had to fly across the Danube. But now her game is to detach them from Turkey by establishing a spurious independence. The provinces are governed separately by Hospodars, who, under a proper system, might be appointed by the PORTE with every security for the good government of the people. The Cz,uR, however, is not content with this, and demands that the national feeling of the PRoumans shall be gratified by the union of the two provinces, which will thus, it is urged, receive a surer guarantee for their liberties. In fact, a Rouman State is to be erected somewhat on the model of the Greek kingdom. Nothing is said about the position of the ruler, but there can be little doubt that the next step would be to substitute an hereditary Sovereign for the nominee of the Pon.TE. It will be remembered that Greece began with a President, but was soon changed into a Monarchy, which has become, as far as the will of the Court is concerned, a mere dependency of RuBsia. Now, such a result in the case of the Moldo-Wallachian territory England is surely bound to guard against. Who can doubt the consequences of establishing on the banks of the Danube a State tending to become every day more and more independent of Constantinople ? The people of the provinces have no claim to be considered as a separate nation. They belong to a race of which several millions inhabit Austrian territory, and a large number the Russian province of Bessarabia. If there is to be a Rouman nation, the CZARt should give up part of his own dominions to the Government at Bucharest; if, as is no doubt the case, the new State is to be merely a tool of
Russia, we can see nothing but danger to Turkey ald embarrassment to Europe in the intrigues to which its existence would give rise.
Yox are th.! Moido-Wallachians fitted by posi-
tion or capacity to play an independent part in Europe. Their country is a perfect plain, and naturaly indefensible. They themselves are of the stuff which may well be built into the fabric of other empires, but has not the hardness and solidity to stand by itself. A smal body of Boyards, luxurious -without taste or inteUigence, aping Paris and its doings in their provincial way, and caring nothing for their own nation or any other as long as they can obtain the means of living in idleness and indulgence; an army of priests, poor and uneducated, all at the service of Russia, and looking up to the CZAR withreligious reverence; and, finally, a serf peasantry, which it seems a mockery to call upon to deliberate in the forthcoming Divans-a class wvithout the elements of instruction, and without hope or care for any change in their degraded lot-such are the elements of which Moldo-Wallachian society is composed. Who can for a moment be deluded by the commonplaces uttered respecting liberty and nationality, or believe that this corrupt and unlettered population can be anything else than the instrument of the powerful Monarchy the aggressive spirit of wbich is not likely to be tamed by a single defeat ?
We regret, therefore, that the French Govermment should have a second time allowed itself to be influenced by the representations vlhich Russia, in accordance with her natural policy, has not ceased to make. The endeavours of our late enemy to gain over the French Court and people are sufficiently notorious, but they have been marked with so little tact and have been so obvious in their purpose that we can hardly account for their success withl a people so quickwitted and sensitive to the ludicrous. However, porseverance has had its reward, and in the French press and French society Russian opinions have lately found a sufficiently favourable reception. But we cannot doubt that the good sense of the EM]rEnoit will cause him to take a clear view of this important question. In spite of articles official or semi-official we believe that the course which justice and sound policy demand must eventually receive the assent of the Tuileries. If the allies permit so great an invasion of the SuLTA.N'S rights as is involved in the union of the Principalities, it may be predicted that the war will prove to have been waged in vain. The interests of Europe demand that the status of these provinces during centuries shall be still preserved, and that no political experiment shall be tried on so valuable a subject. It will, we think, be the duty of England to declare positively against any tampering with the integrity of the Turkish empire, and to act with firmness in support of the resolution she has taken.

PARIS, WEDNESDAY, Fas. 11, 6 P.Y.
Paris is, I believe, now definitively named as tle place of meeting of the Conferences on the Neuchitcl question, and the time of meeting wiU be the beginning of next month. Between this and then diplomacy will put forth all its strength-not vainly, I should hope-to leave as little as possible for the Plenipotentiaries to do. Its efforts will be directed to the very difficult-I do not say impossible-task of pleasing all parties; of satisfying the incomprehensible King of Prussia, and leaving Switzerland not in a worse position than she is now in. Our experience of conferences is not of a kind to give one a very exalted idea of them, and I should not venture to aflirm that the settlement of this question (all simple as it may appear) will be easy or speedy. It is certain that the Swiss Plenipotentiary, Dr. Kern, has already committed the fault of promising too much; hence the dissatisfaction said to be prevailing in several of the Swiss Cantons; and I incline to the suspicion that the Emperor of the French himself is open to the same censure, and that he has probably counted too much ou the readiness of the King of Prussia to oblige him.
The French Admiral in command at the Pirmeus has, according to the latest accounts, made his preparations fordeparture, and has already embarked his military stores. The names of the new Greek Ministers have been submitted to the French and, I presume, the English Government, and are, I understand, approved.
Feruk Khan, thePersianAmbassador, is expected to leave for London in a few days, where, if we can credit the accounts just received from Persia, his task will not be difficult.
The Government evening paper announces that the Shah of Persia has decidedly returned to his pacific intentions. His position with respect to the Imaunis has become extremely diflicult. Some time since he wished that the image of Ali should be given to him, as the sovereigns of Persia are accustomed to wear it as a talisman when any serious event occurs, or vrhen they dread an attack on their persons. The Imaum whose duty it is to carry the sacred relic to the palace refused to do so, and forbad the other Imaums placed under his jurisdiction to do so. This refusal of the Imaum is regarded at Teheran as the prelude to a violent opposition, and some parties are accused of wishing to dethrone the Shah, and set up Murad Mirza, the conqueror of Herat, in his place. A revolt of the Bab;es, an influential sect at Ispahan and Shiraz, is likewise appreliended.
A letter from Teheran to the 3d of January, vidl Russia, states that Issa Khan, who governed the town of Herat in the name of the Shah, after having defended it against the Persian troops, has been assassinated by an Affghan.
The Moniterd r.1, I'Armee publishes some interesting details relative to the movements of the Persian troops. The Court of Teheran was aware of the departure of the British squadron for the Persian Gulf long before its arrival, but it did not expect its territory would have been invaded without the usual preliminary declaration of war. In order to be prepared for all events, the Shah had formed a corps of 30,(00 men, inteiided to act in the southern part of the empire. Such was the position of affairs, when he heard at the same time of the arrival ofthe British expedition and the capture of Bushire. On hearing this news the Shah assembled his Divan, and it was resolved that the corps commanded by Mirza Mehemed Khan should move forward and take a position to cover the province of Farsistan, of wlhich the English had occupied the coast in such an unexpected manner. On the 7th of Januarv Fezlali Khan, who commands the first division of the Army of the South, quitted Kashan, his head-quarters, by orders received from Teheran, with his first brigade, to proceed to the defile of Zindjeran, on the frontiers of Farsistan. At the sanie time he conimanded Emineh Khan, who commanids the second brigade of his division, and who was at Hamadan, to march to the same place and joini him. These orders w.ere punctually executed, and by the last accounts the two generals were together on the 14th January in the province of Farsistan, whither MIirza Mehemed Khan was hastening at the head of two other divisions. The Mniiteur de ''A rntd adds that, notwithstanding the assertions to the contrary, the entire Persian population is devotedly attached to the Government, and aU the tribes have most readily supplied their armed contingent for the present war. The province of Fars, or Farsistan, is one of the finest in the kingdom. Although it has lost much of its ancient splendour, it supplies the Governmeiit with grcat resources. Situate between the Kerinan, the Seistan, the Irak Ajemi, Beloochistan, and the Persian Gulf, it is divided into two distinct portions, the one called Ghernisir, or the hot country, and the other the Serdsir, or the cold country. A vast chain of mountaiis, called Bakhtery, assists considerably in its defence. It cuts the road to Teheran and protects that city. An army comiing from the north cannot reach Fars except by the celebrated defile of Zindjeran, known anciently by the name of " the Gates of Susiana," and when that position is well defended it is impossible to force it. There exists another defile equally celebrated, in the centre of which flows the river Bendemir, which the first column of Fezlali Khan's first division occupies at this moltient. The plan now adopted to cover the province has always succeeded. Mirza Mehemed khan, the Comiander-ini-Chief, is to establish his head-qluarters at Shiraz, the capital of Farsistan, which is stiU one of the finest towns in Persia. Shiraz is situate on a small river called the Rocknabad, in the midst of a fertile valley, defended by highl mountains and by a girdle of hils, which forms a strategic linie diHicult of access. This vaUey is about 20 miles long and 10 broad, and its fertility is remarkable. The works of the citadel, constructed by Kerim Khan in 17,68, and repaired by Feth AUi Shah in 190w, vere in a great part dertroyed by the terrible earthquake of 1813, and again in 1824, wvhich left ineffaceable traces. The fortifications were repaired by Mohanmed Shah in 1829, and in 1835, with several improvements on the original plan by a European engineer. The fortifications consist of a brick wall 10 feet thick by 21 high, flankled by 10 round towers, with batteries en barbette, together with a wide and deep ditch all round. The town is defended by a vast citadel, which serves as an arsenal. These works, though well covered, are badly armed. Shiraz, independently of its delicious climate, its monuments, and its women, celebrated for their beauty throughout Asia, merits the attention of the scientific world for giving birth to the two greatest poets of Persia-Saadi, who died aLt 100 years of age in 12ul, and Hafiz, who died in 1389. The monument of the latter has survived all the vicissitudes of his native city. The ruins of Persepolis, the ancient capital of Persia, are 30 miles from Shiraz. There are several other towns in Farsistan worthy of attention besides Shiraz, such as Yezd, Aberl;houd, Kazeroun, Ferozabad, and Darabjerd. Bushire, lately captured by the British troops, is the most important town on the Persian Gulf. It is in some measure separated from the remainder of the province, and is surrounded by tribes who were never completely subdued by the Shah. The British army is in an excelent position, having established an intrenched camp round Bushire, and their lines, admirably fortified, are secure against any attack.
The Nord says that the Russian Government will
not admit Biitish Consuls to the ports of the Black Sea until the British fleet shall have quitted the Turkish waters, which has not yet taken place, the Einglish fleet being still in the Bosphorus. The IVwd adds, that this resolution is most wise, for as long as the British fleet remains in the Bospborus the straits are not closed and the treaty of Paris not executed, and there is nothing to prevent the English Government from sending their fleet again into the Black Sea.
A commission has just been appointed to examine thoroughly the question of the currency. The principal members are-MM. Michel Chevalier, de Parieu, de Boinvilliers, Guillefroy, and other Councillors of State, together with MM. Schneider, Leroux, and several members of the Senate and Legisative Body. The commission has the right to examine witnesses. The old proverb says, " Better late than never," but it in rather late. Since 1849 M. Michel Chevalier has in the Journal des Dgbats
frequently directed the attention of the public to this important subject. At that period nothing was easier than to adopt a resolution in conformity with the true principles of political economy, and
with the spirit of the fundamental law (7 Germinal, An XI.) on the currency.
The Debats of to-day contains the 8econd of a series of articles by M. Michel Chevalier on "the position in which the prohibitive regime places French industry with respect to 3.nglish industry." In this article, which is well worthy of attention, M. Chevalier triumphantly vindicates la perfide Albiom from the charges which the French protectionists indulge in against her. He concludes
"The wages of operatives have increased in England, their condition has improved in consequence of the reduction in the price of necessaries, internal tranquillity is consolidated, and the finances, which were suffering, have been re-established. In a word, England has a thousand times reason to be proud of the courageous experiment she has tried upon herself, and which is so decisive for the whole world, as to the relative merits of the prohibitive and liberal 5ystems. Impartial and just men will decide if in France (to -whom that reform has, without the slightest reciprocity, opened new and vast market&, and which becomes richer, every day richer, by it) we act rightly in insulting England for a reform made on so liberal and so grand a scale, and in denouncing itas an act of perfidy. Those who look to acts, and not to words only, will see*if thatpersistencein misinterpreting a policy so worthy of honour does not proceed from selfish interests, the source of which is elsewhere than on the banks of the Thames; and if the movement on the part of certain classes of producers, organized into an association under the pretext of saving France from the misfortune of paying an imaginary tribute to England, does not mark the desire of extorting a tribute much more substantial from the French consumer in general, and from 20,000,000 of cultivators in particular."
The following letter, addressed to the editor of the Si&cle, but not yet published, refutes some calumnious statements on the character of the late Prince Eugene Beauharnais contained in the sixth volume of Marshal Marmont's memoirs:-
"Paris, Feb. 11.
"Being confined to my room by severe illnems, I learn from a friend that the sixth volume of the Memoirs of the Duk;c de Ragusa contains the most extraordinary and most calumnious assertions on the conduct of Prince Eugdne in 1814. I have in my possession incontrovertible proofs of the complete falsehood of all that Marshal Marmont asserts on that head. I am, unfortunately, not in a state at present to publish those documents, but I shall do so when my health pernnits me. I confine myself at present to repelling with all theindignationthey deserveassertionsso unfounded.
" PLANAT DE LA FAXGE,
Former Orderly Officer of the Emperor."
The Gazette de France hasreceived asecond warning (avertissement), for an article containing an attack w 1 the Constitution. The first warning given to the Gazette was on the 14th February, 1853. A third official warning will amount to a suspension of the paper.
"Count Mortier," says the M07itens-, "has tendered his resignation of the functions of First Charnberlain to Prince Jerome, which has been accepted with great regret by his Imperial ig,hness." The resignation of'the Count is attributed to a return of the dreadful malady (insanity) with which he was afficted somne years since.
The Semaine Finaci&re says,-
" The great interest of the money-market is at present concentrated in the projected duties on industrial securities quoted at the Bourse. One, we understand, is to be a duty on the revenues of joint-stock companies, and the other a duty on the transfer of industrial securities of all kdnds. It is said that the amount of the tax on the revenues of the companies is to be 3 per cent. on the dividend, and that the sum levied on the transfer of industrial securities is to be 4 per cent., collected by the agens-de-change. It is also said that the budget for 1858 is to contain an estimate of the sum which is thus to accrue to the State."

CONSTATLNOPLE, FEn. 2.
As I wrote to you in my last, the Commission for the Danubian Principalities, having closed its work here, is breaking up, and the members are making preparations to pass the two months which must elapse before they can begin their work at Bucharest as best they may. Three of them embarked on Friday last on board the Austrian Lloyd's steamer forTrieste. Baron K61ler, the Austriaxn, and M. Basili, the Russian Commissioner, are going to Vienna; and Baron Biechthofen, the Prussian Commissioner, to Berlin; Baron Talleyrand, their French colleague, had, as you remember, received orders to proceed at once to the Principalities, but since then counter-orders have arrived, deferring his departure. Sir Henry Pulwer intends to make an excursion to Greece. Al. de Benzi, the Sardinian Commissioner, is alone, as yet, uincertain about his fate.
WVhile the Commission is thus dispersing a flight of Moldo-Wallachian great Boyards is setting in towards Constantinople. Prince Bibesco, ex-H[ospodar of Wallachia, and young Stirbey, his nephew, have, already arrived. Old Prince Stirbey, Cantacuzeno, and several Moldavians, are expected. They are all pretenders to the dignity of Hospodar in one of the two Principalities, yet they are not all the pretenders, for those who are for the union do not come to the Porte. I do not mean to imply by this that those who come here are against the union; they are neither for nor against the union ; they want simply to be Hospodars. They are ready at that price to put on the Turkish fez cap or exhibit any bicolour or tlicolourthe protection of whichmight offer them some chance of success. The Unionist or national party rejects them, so they try to make a merit of necessity and offer their services to the Porte.
It is v-ery mruch to be regretted that the mistaken policy of the late Turkish Ministry has so alienated the national party that it will be difficult, Hf not impossible, for the present Government to win back its sympathies; and that the latter will most likely be obliged to favour the pretensions of one or other of these gentlemen, who have all of them been the pau-tisans of some foreign influence in the Principalities. And yet the true policy of the Turkish Government would have been to direct the national movement instead of opposing it, for it was from the beginning anti-Russian and anti-Austrian. It is owing to the interference of Russia that the Principalities have emerged from the humiliating position of a Turkish pashalic, into which they had sunk, and yet as soon as they obtained by
tIi organc statutes some kind of political liberty it was employed against the pretensions of Russia. Placed between Russia, Austria, and Turkey, the
rising national feeling instinctively recognized that it had least to fear for its developement from the last-named country, and the national party became identical with the Turkish party. Eventhe movement of 1848 was not directed against Turkey, but against theforeigninfluence,predominantinthecountry, and, althoughTurkeywas obliged byRussia to interfere, to
occupy the Principalities, andto exilethe ringleaders, the latter were not only permitted to stay in the empire, but were in several instances employed in a civil or military capacity, an evident proof that Turkey herself recognized that the movement had not been directed against her. In spite of these antecedents of the national party in the Principalities, as soon as the Congress of Paris determined the reorganization of Moldo-Wallachia, the late Turkish Ministry, instead of entering into the idea and trying to work it out in concert with the party which was averse to foreign influence, got frightened at the idea of union which began to be agitated, and employed measures of coercion to impede its movements. It has thus deprived itself of its most natural supporters withouit checking the agitation for the union. On the contrary, the measures of coercion have, especially in Moldavia, made many
partisan)s for the union, which, from the vague desire of a comparatively few enthusiasts, has now become the rallying cry of a strong party. The evil was already done when Redschid Pasha came into power; and although, as you know, he has
declared that he wiU not oppose the discusk6n of the union in the Divans, it will be hard work to efface the marks of pressure by a conciliatory policy. Still it would be desirable that an attempt s,hould be made at least to bring about an understanding between the members of the national party and the Turkish Government. Probably with the most enthusiastic partisans of the union this may fail, but, if the Turkish Government comes forward frankly and shows a sincere desire to support all the reasoaable wishes for a truly national reorganization of the Principalities, there can be little doubt that the more moderate wiU rally round it, and prefer the certainty of a truly national government for each of the provinces to the dubious chances of the union.
All the letters from the Greek frontier speak of nothing else but brigandage. What with the number of marauders left behind after the outbreak in 1854, and not a few disbanded soldiers who fraternize with them, the bands were never more numerous and daring. The Turkish authorities are, however, beginning to display more vigour than usual, and several encounters took place in the vicinity of Pharsala, which ended fatally for the brigands; one chief was kiled, and another, named Koodsona, is on his way to Constantinople. It is but fair to say that the Greek authorities are just as active as the Turks, and those who are driven from the Turkish territory often faU into their hands. Bnt all this energy wil not root out the evil so long as the police of the frontier is not remodelled. In both countries the frontier guards are indifferently organized irregular troops, who not rarely find it more convenient to connive with than to fight against the brigands. In Greece, besides the profits of such an arrangement, a spurious national feeling towards the brigands who are nearly all Greeks, contributes to blind them. On the Turkish side, the bad and irregular pay of the Albanian irregulars is srfficient to account for the leniency. They get 60 piastres a-month, but even of this vretched pEy they are sometixr s for a year in arrear, and all this time they are supposed to feed and thrive on their ra ion of br'a.d, which they get daily. Even a Si! t 1. st rn.-ch would get tired of such simple fare .t aar round. They are thus comp(:iJed to ' ut for themselves, and their fraturni;ing with tne brigands is scarcely a secret. Indeed, one of the late engagements with i Lem the5 deserted their leader, and made common cause with the brigands, who thus remained masters of the field. There is, however, now some hope that this state of things will Thange.
The remains of the Polish Legion are not yet disposed of. There are still several hundreds now remaining in the barracks of Raider Pasha, waiting for the decision of the Turkish Government. Redschid Pasha, even before he came to power, offered to settle those who were willing on his estate in the neighbourhood of Armiro, on the Greek frontier. The terms were very advantageous; he promised to maintain them for a year, to give them the land, a pair of oxen, a cow, or a dozen sheep, and the seed for the first year. But before this plan could be realized, owing to the pressure of affairs on all sides, Sadik Pasha, of Cossack extraction, but now Commander of the First Regiment of the Cossacks of the Sultan, came and offered to form a regiment of Dragoons of the remains of the Polish Legion, and take these as well as the First Regiment of Cossacks to the Greek frontier, where they should be employed in putting down brigandage and restoring order. This latter plan was accepted, and several hundred uniforms, arms, and horses assigned for the purpos. . Thus those who choose to remain soldiers may enter the new regiment, and those who prefer an agricultural life may settle on Redschid Pasha's estate.
There is a project on foot to provide Pera, Galata, and Tophan6 with a good and sufficient supply of water. The idea was started by an English company, which intends to confide the execution of the project to the engineers who constructed the waterworks at Berlin and Lisbon.
The capital was ever the spoilt child of the Sultans, and was not only exempt, as it is at present, from taxation, but every one of them endeavoured to enrich it with useful and ornamental works. Pure water inabundance, thatgreat necessity of a warm climate, was one of their chief cares, and they not only kept up the waterworks erectedbytheByzantineEmperors,but enlarged them and constructed new ones to relieve the wants of a daily growing town. But it is long ago since Sultans had money for such works of public utility, and the consequence is that they are falling into decay, and often a great want of water is felt in the latter part of summer and in autunra. This want is, above all, felt on this side of the Golden Horn, owing to the rapid growth of the town, where the houses are estimated at not less than 50,000. The last repairs in the waterworks which supply Pera and Galata were made by Sultan Mahmoud, and since that time the size of the town has almost doubled. The company, which is represented here by Mr. Routh, intends to supply this deficiency by repairing the old works and bringing in a new stream from a place called Gend6re. They ask for a privilege of 50 years, and a guarantee of 6 per cent. on the capital laid out, both of which conditions have been accepted in principle by the Turkish Government. They engage to bring the water to the houses, and supply even the upper stories, at a moderate rate, fixed after the survey of the engineers. No proprietor would be oblged to take advantage of this convenience unless he chose; but, as the company expects to be able to supply the water at a much cheaper rate than now, (30 piastres and more a-day being paid now in a large house,) there can be little doubt that few will remain behind. They engage to have in every street fountains, to supply abundance of water in case of a fire, and to provide all the mosques with it-in fact, to put the whole on a European footing.

BERLIN, F=. 10.
Last Sunday the congreg,ation that was leaving the Dam, or Cathedral, were startled by great guns being fired immediately in their neighbourhood, on the Lustgarten, that lies between the Palace and the Museum; the 12 rounds that were fired announced, however, no victory over a warlike foe, but the safe delivery of the Princess Friedrich Carl of a daughter: the great event had taken place very early the same morning in Potsdam.
The so-called Carnival here is progressing merrily enough for the members of the Court and the hatate volge. The King continues hs series of grand entertainments on the Wednesdays, three subscription balls at the Opera-house take up the Thursdays, the Minister-President has appropriated to himself the Tuesdays, and the Minister of Commerce the Fridays; one or other of the Ambassadors generally takes any Monday that may be vacant, and the p-rofanumu rugus, in addition to the rest of the evenings of the week for its priva e amusements, has Saturday for masked balls at Kroll's and elsewhere. Last Saturday, however, thePrince and Princess of Prussia were obliged to take that evening for an unusually briUiant assembly which they gave, and for which Prince Friedrich Wilhelm came to Berlin expressly from Breslau, and left again on the next Monday. Yesterday evening was signalized by the most brllliant ball of the season, whicl was given by Lord and Lady Bloomfield at the
British Emba-ssy to about 400 guests. The fair dancing world of Berlin and the corps de ballet diplo-
matique et militaire grieve sadly t'Xat it will probablv be also the last to be given them this season under that roof and those propitious auspices, as Lady Bloomfield leaves here probably this week f r England. Most of the Ministers, the entire corps diplornatique, the most distinguished officers of the Prussian army, and the sommit&s of literature, science, and art, contributed, in conjunction With what in London would be called the world , f
fashion, to fill the spacious apartments of the Embassy, while the commodious ballroom afforded not only every incentive, but also ample space for the gratification of the dancers. It is only at the Royal Schloss here that the style of our Minister's entertainments can be surpassed as r. - gards the ample appointments of the table and t! e
richness of the plate, &c. The entertainments * f the nobility and even of the Royal Princes do n t come up to them in this respect; and nowhere des the beau mende of Berlin yield itself so willingly to
the charm of provenance and winning hospitality* s under the auspices of Lord and Lady Bloomfeld.
Baron von Brunnow, the new Russian Minister here, the successor of Baron Budberg, arrived
on Sunday last, but as yet very little has been seen of him. Baron Meyendorff has also passed through here on his way from Nice te St. Petersburg, where
he is abeut to enter on the duties of his nen post.
Advices from Carlsruhe mentioned that the GraLd
Duke MihaIel of 'Russia was expected there on the 9th inst., and that the Grand Duke Constantine would soon follow him thither; the espousals of the former with the Princess Cecilia of Baden are to take place in St. Petersburg next May, by which time the Empress Mother wil also have retarned to the norther capitaL A telegraphic despatch from Turin, of the 7th inst states, however, that the Grand Duke had left tLere the previous night for Geneva, on his return home.
Prince Nicholas of Nassau, who is now in Paris, has the intention of accompanying the next expedition which the French Government fits out against the Kabyles.
The ex-Minister Hassenpflug runs a good chance of being obliged to expatriate himself from the Electorate of Hesse Cassel, for the simple reason that no one will let him any house or apartments; when Cassel had already become too hot for him, he removed to Marburg, and there the Casino would not admit him to membership, so that his position there was at once compromised and spoiled; his landlord there had given him notice to quit, into no other house could he get admission, and when in his trouble he made inquiries in Casel, the capital of the State he had lately nisgoverned, he learnt, to his dismay, that
obody would have anything to do with him.

MAfADRID, Fm. 6.
The proposed journey of the Queen to the south has been definitively abandoned. Unfounded reports have been circulated of deep political designs connected with the project. In reality it originated merely in the Queen's own desire to visit her sister and pass the Holy Week at SeviMe. Marshal Narvaez disapproved the plan, and is said to have made various representations against it to Her Majesty. The question has been finaly settled at a Council of Ml inisters. The expense of the journey and visit to A irious southern towns would have been considerable, it being by custom indispensable that in such a progress the Sovereign should dispense her bounty with a liberal hand. The estimated cost is 60,0001., an outlay which could hardly be considered justifiable in the present state of Spanish finances.
The state of the roads between this and Bayonne is such that the mail now invariably takes from 60 to 70 hours to perform the journey, instead of accomplishing it in 48 or 50. The quantity of snow that has fallen is prodigious. As for the diligences, they arrive when they can, in any number of days. It were easy to imagine oneself traveUing in Russia, rather than in Spain. It taxes the combined strength of mules and oxen to drag even the comparatively light mail coach, which holds but two persons, over the three puertos, or mountain passes, of Descargas, Salinas, and Somosierra. The snowdrifts are enormous, the roads in many places as slippery as glass, and tniecold intense. The wolves, if they do not exactly look into your carriage windows and clamour for fresh meat, show themselves occasionaUy among the piles of rock and snow. In Madrid itself the cold has been very severe, and there has been considerable mortality from pulmonia, or inflammation of the lungs, which is the curse of this capital.

SHOREDITCH ALMSHOUSES.-The anniversary festi-
SHOREDITCH ALmsHsouss.-The anniversary festival of this institution, founded for the support of 20 aged widows, took place yesterday evening, at the London Tavern, where about 150i gentlemen sat down to an exceUent dinner. under the presidency of aMr. J. Ware, supported by Messrs. S. C. Butler, AM.P., H. C. Davis, W. H. Howe, W. R. Scores, &c. The usual loyal and patriotic toasts having been given and warmly responded to, the chairman gave the toast of the evening. He urged that the charity met the claims of those towards whose wants no other aid was exteuded, and to relieve which no less a sum than 3,7001. had been sunk in a poor locality. He was sorry to say they were now indebted to the treasu-er to the amount of 2201., and they denended on the benevolent efforts of that evening to liquidate that debt, and to continue and extend their present weekly allowance to each of the dependent inmates of the little institution. He was sure that they would not allow them to reduce that income, but that they would, after the pecuniary sacrifices which they had made to obtain the freehold and complete the almshouses, support an institution which was at once an honour to its founders and an ornament to the neighbourhood. This appeal vas llberaUy responded to, between 3001. and 400l. subscription being announced by the secretary before the close of the evening. Mr. Harker officiated as toastmaster, and the nmusical arrangements, which were very good, were under the direction of Mr. Edwin Gray, assisted by Messrs. Burgess, Garland, and Holmes.
THE StUNKEN- SHIrS AT SEBASTOPOL.-According to the New York Herald, the name of the American who has contracted to raise the Russian vessels sunk at Sebastopol is Gowen, a Boston man. He is the same person who raised the wreck of the United States steam frigate Missouri in the harbour of Gibraltar. "This wreck," says th? Ht-eald, "had lain eight years in that harbour, and the British Government made continued attempts for three yea-s to remove it, until the English engineers gave up in despair, and reported that human ingenuity could not free the harbour from that danger. The British Cabinet then requestedl thatthe Gwvernment of the United States wouild take the matter in hand, and it sent out a live Yankee, who effected the desired purpoFe in 60 days, under contract for $59,000. This achievement was looked upon with great surprise in England, and probably led a member of Parliament to declare that the Ashburton treaty, negotiated about the same time, wxas a piece of overreaching, as it had been negotiated in Washington with a live Yankee. Vben Mr. Gowen reclcbed Moscow last summer, to lay his proposals before the Russian Government, he found the ground already covere.1 with French and English engineers, some of whom had beew there for months. He called upon Duke Constantine, laid before him the report of the English engineers stating tho remoral of the Missouri from the harbour of Gibh raltar to be impossible, and Marcy's certificate that he had done it in 60 days at a very low price. "You are just the man for me," said Constantir.e, aind in 24 hours the contract was signed. and our Ya,l.-(e wva. on bis way to Sebastopol to surrey his grounid. 'Fh, Rmssi.n G,vernment placed a smal steamer at his disposal, and showed him how the operation of sinking th! ships l'Vl been done; and the Boston man said he guessed he could return pretty nearly half of them in good order, and clear away the remainder. He is now mnaking his arrangements in this city and in Philadelphia, as he found on his return to this country that New York was a better place to prepare for a great enterprise like this than oer neighboiring village of Boston. AU the machinery will be prepared and shipped from here for Sebastopol early in the spring, and will be accompanied with a large corps of American engineere, ship carpenters, and so forth. We commend a consideration of these facts to the attention of aU the European Governments, and suggest that we can do anything for them by contract, even to the carrying on of a war; and, moreover, that New York is just the place for all itis kind of enterprise. We are ready here to undertake anything, from the making of a pistol or building of a frigate, to the conquest of China.
BAINFUL EXP, ?I-ENT.- Vhe Lyons, New York, BepuW&iein says a lad in that viage wished to ascertain how tight his wet tongue would stick to an axe that had been lying in the woodshed all night. The experiment was successful, and the illustration of tbe tenacity of a frosty axe to a wet tongue far moro forcible than pleasing. The little feUow's cries (or attempts to cry) brought his father to his assistance, and the boy, with the axe sticLinR fast to his uuruly member, was carried into the house, and it was some ine before they could be made to part company.

LONDON AND SOUTH-WESTERN.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the station, Waterloo-road, Mr. J. W. Chaplin, M.P., in the chair.
Mr. Crombie, the secretary, read the minutes of the last meeting, which were confirmed. The report, an abstract of which appeared in he Tinmes of Saturday, was taken as read.
The CnAi2LNL%A, in moving the adoption of the report, said they could readily imagine the manner in whichlthe proprietors had received the announcement of a dividend for the half-year ending the 30th of June, 1850, at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum; but, fortunately, the dividend which he had to propose on the present occasion showed that their affairs had undergone a very agreeable change. The increase of traffic on their lines had been very satisfactory, and, with a few exceptions, the traffic at all their stations had progressed. They had 76 stations on their lines, and, with the exception of six smaaU ones, the aggregate receipts of which onlv amounted to 1661., the traffic had increased at every station. That result had fuUy borne out the few observations he had made at the last meeting, and showed that the effects of peace on their traffic at aU the stations were similar to those of war. It was satisfactory for them to know that, whether there was peace or whether there was war, they had the prospect of success. He was glad to say that their relations with other companies were satisfactory, every facility was given for the interchange of traffic, and equal fares were charged with a view to neutralize competition. UnI fortunately the South-Eastern, on their branch to Reading, hitherto an unprofitaole undertaking, had thought proper to adopt a low rate of fares. They were on amicable terms with the Brighton and Great Western Companies. The branch of the South-Eastern Company fromi Peigate to P.eading had been an expensive concerni, and a very low scale of charges had been adopted on it with a view to attract traffic to the line and make it more remunerative. Their locomotive power was very efficiently maintained; and he thought the cost of working would bear favourablecomparison iith that of any otherrailway company in the country. The present state of the money-market had prevented their making progress with their 4 per cent. debenture stock in lieu of raising money on debentures. They hoped, however, that the money-market would soon become more favourable; they had already converted 4,0001. into that stock. The chairman of the Brighton Company had recently alluded to the very heavy rates and duties which railway companies had to pay. They would find that on their liiie the rates and Government duty amounted to 10 per cent. of the sum available for dividend, and when they also deducted the income-tax those charges amounted to 17 per cent. of the dividend. That was not all, for owing to the state of the law the company had to pay heavv legal costs in consequence of appeals against unfair and unjust rating. The stamps on the transfers alone amounted to 8,5001. a-year. The taxes altogether were not less than 20 per cent. of their profits, They had to defend themselves more or less against 10 projects,which were now before Parliament, affecting their property. Some of them would become tributary and assist their traffic, while others were intended to act injuriously on their property. The present state of the money-market was not favourable for such projects, but it would be necessary for the proprietors to autorize the board to deal with such matters as migtt be deemed advisable ior the benefit of the company. There was one of those schemes for a broad gauge line from Salisbury to Southampton they had looked at with some anxiety. It was a monstrous scheme, and he thought it would not be tolerated. The only6excuse for it was that coals could be brought over it from Bristol and other places on the broad gauge without a break of gauge at Salis-
ury. Itwas proposed to lay down rails parallel to their line for threo-fourths of the distance. W itwas congi-
such~ ~ ~~~~~~1 a ceeUaRpps n odm it.T, wa oni dereed ,at the tuabo,n coal was subject to a break of gauge, and that an additional ncarge of id. per ton paid theaexpense of chandgng from One gauge to the othier, the trifling economy of sav that expense could not justify the construction of mies of para,el line onr the broad gauge from Salisbury to SouthamPton. It was right to state that Lord Barrington, chairman of the Great western Corn. Hany, had assured him that his company (the Great bestern) had no connexion with the project. He (the chairman) did hope that the landowners, the Board of Trade, and Parliament woulol not "antion such a scheme, hut oppose and condemn it. The director,
proposed, with the santion of the shareholders to construct a branch from their line at cOmseY to nedbridge which would shorten the distance between Salisbury and South. =amspton, and, he flded, meet the reclireents of the trafrfa
adset the questio vat rest for all future time. He hopedl the proprietors would support the board in dlealing with those projects to the best of their ability, and in a manner mroat conducive to the intereds of the companyn (Cheers. He would be happy to answer anY questions that 13ighe be deemed necessairy with regard to their affairs.
Mr. TITm, X.P., seconded the motion, atid in doing so deprecated the prjet fo carying the broadlgauge into Southampton. Experience hadf p roved the folly of railway comapetition, and he trusted the bill would be rejected, He then called attention to the wages of the porters on the line, and recommnended the board to consider the propriety o'f raising tbem and dealing with the tservants of the company with liberality.
Mr. AsuasoRE complained of the large amount of their law and Parliamentary expenses. In the year 1853 they
had expended 25,7411. in law and epe-ineering, in 1854 they amounted to 10.6231., in 1855 to ,16f,and for the last half-year to 7,0751. Those expenses appered to be enornmous, and he thought by allowing the s1olicitor a liberal salary for his services a large stun would be saved to thae company. He concluded by proposing a resolution to the effect that the salary of the solicit-or be 1, 5001. a-year to mneet all expenses, with the exception of costs out of pocket.
Mr. Serjeant GASELEE contended that the wages of the porters on the line were sufficient, and in proof of it they were pestered with aLpplications for situations; on their line, although the age was restricted to 35 years, and the height of the men to 5 feet S inches. They were constantly raising and promoting their servants.
Mr. PUNCHER considered the report, with the exception of the 6,1 per cent, as a black one, and that view had been co-nfirmed by the statement of the chairman, showing that they were taxed to the extent of 20 per cent, of their profits. He would be glad to see tb e wages of the porters raised from 16s. per week to 17g. 6d. as on other lines, hut he thought great miistalkes ha~d heen made in raising foremen to the position of superintendents, and their salaries from 21. or 31. a week to 3001. and 4001. a year, by which they were elevated~ above their business and had deputies and clerk-s to do the work for them. He complained that the accounts of 1853 showed a discrepancy in the capital account as comnpared with those of 1856 to the extent of 65,0001l.
Mr. CLOSE, and Mr. HOYx-S, the aud(itors, and Mlr. UZIELLI, a director, explained various items, and stated that the discrepancy arose from the abandonment of certain works, and that both accounts were right.
Mr. HnnArArTr stated that he had recently attended at the office to obtain information with respect to the accounts, which were fully 1ex-plained to him by Mr. Morgan, to whom he felt much obied. He was also pressed by the chairman to make any inquiry he thought proper, and to obtain every information he required. Hlis principle was to close the capital account, and if they could not do that cornpletely, to approach that state of things as near as possible. Ã¯Â¿Â½'he practice was to charge all new works and things to capital, and to charge the expense of the maintenance and renewal of things to revenue. He hoped they woulId inprove upon that system, and cbarge all new things that were to increase the revenue to that account. He was glad to
peciethat they had ado pted a system of through rates btentheir railways and those of the Great Western, aLnd that they were working amicably with that company.
The CHAIRMAN said there was a very considerable amount of traffic interchanged between the two companies with Southampton and the north.
Mr. HERAP'ATII remarked that he was very well satisfied with the report.
The CHAIRMAN, in reply to a question respecting items for printing and advertising, said that a great deal of their outlay for deoveloping the traffic by excursions and otherwise would be of no use if they did not advertise rather extensively.
The report was then unanimously adopted.
A dividendl at the rate of G.; per cent, per annum for the half-year was declared, subject to income-tax.
A long discussion ensued on Mlr. Ashmore's motion for fi xing the salay of the solicitor at 1,5001, s-year.
The CHAIRMAN explained that the matter was under the consideration of a comimittee of the directors ; that Mr. Ilircham had always evinced the utmost willingness to submit his bills to taxation, or to meet the views of the directors in any way he could with respect to his professional charges.
Mir. BIRCHAM1, the solicitor, explained that the salary proposed would not pay more than the office expenses, and although a considerable amouant appeared under the head of law expenses, hut a smnall portion of it came to him. Outi of one item of 1,0561., law expenses, only 1351. came into his department.
Mr. Serj eant GASELEE thought they should engage the 'whole of the services of aneminent solicitor, at 2,0000. a-year, and not allow him to have any private practice whatever,
Air. CASTLEmAx defended the course adopted by the directors, and contended that they must employ a solicitor of t-he highest qualification. and position in order to protect their initerests. The stun named would not be sufficient to secure the services they required, anel, fromi his knowledge of the subject, they could not do better than fix a scale of charges, and they would then pay in proportion to the work dons; hut they should leave the matter in the hands of the directors
Mr. Sllow, moved an amendment, to the effect that the whole question be referred back to the directors for their consideration.
Mr. ROLLS seconded the amendment, which, on being put to the meeting, was declared carried.
The retiring directors and auditor were then re-elected.
The directors were authorized to raise the money for the construction of the extension line to Exeter, to promote a bill in Parliament, and to petition in favour of the Hunger. ford-bridge Bill, which, if carried, would open up sn approac'h for carriages from Charing-cross to the Waterloo station.
A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceeding.
-LANCASHIRtE AND YORKSHnIE.
The directors of this company have decided to recommend to the proprietors at their next mieeting to declare a dividend from the earnings of the past half-year at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, leaving an amount to be added to the surplus.

LAW RBPORT.
COIJRT OF CO, FWC,R.V TTven-l- WT in DE1lNX V. LIGHT.
(Before the LORDS JUSTICES oF APPEAL.)
This was an appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor Stuart, by which he decreed the specific performance of an agreement, with costs.
The plaintiff, Miss Emma Denne, of Elbridge, Kent, the owner of a piece of land at Maudlin Hedge, at Lower Shot, Kingston, Surrey, part of Ham Common Field, containing one acre and one rood, contracted to sell the same to Mr. Danie Light, the defendant, for lOOL., and it was agreed that thea purchaser should not be entitled to any earlier title than that disclosed by the abstract to be delivered on the 14th of MIay, 1846. The abstract was duly delivered, and Mr. Light refused to complete, on the alleged ground that Miss Denne has not shown a title to any way or carriageway thereto. A dispute has taken place whether the lady's agent did not represent to Mr. Light that there was a right of way to the land, the former insisting that no such representation was made, and also alleging that as owner she had thesame right of access as others holdingpart of a common laud. The Vice-Chancellor, as before stated, made a decree for specific perfonnance. The defendant appealed.
MIr. Malins and Mr. W. D. Lewis supported the decree of the Court below; Mr. Bacon and Mlr. G. '. Collins appeared for the appellant.
The affidavits being contradictory, the COURT determined that Mr. Nightingale, the agent for the plaintiff, and Ir. Hatch, the son-in-law of Mr. Light, were ordered to be examined vied voce; but, as the counsel on each side refused to initiate the examination, the same was conducted by the Lords Justices.
3Mr. Nightingale deposed that he made the bargain for sale of the land with Mr. Hatch, though the contract is made with Mr. Light. When the bargain was struck the witness could not say to a certainty whether he spoke of there being any right of way, but afterwards the subject was mentioned, and witness told Mr. Hatch that he considered, the land being part of the common land, there must be a right of way to it from the road over other land. Witness had let this land formerly, and the tenant removed his crops over other land without opposition or question. Told Mr. Hatch that his (witness's) employer could not give any other title to a road or way, except that enjoyed by other owners of land, in Ham Common Fields.
MIr. Hatch deposed that he asked Mr. Nightingale whether there was any right of cartway or roadway, and he said it was so, and always was so, in the case of common lands, and that his way would be over Mr. Thomas's land, that being the nearest way to the road, and Mr. Nightingale said the land had been before let, and that the tenant took the crop off in that way, the other sides of the land being " hemmed in." Witness would not have bought at all, unless he had understood there was a right ofv way. Would not positively say, hut his impression was, that Mr. Nightingale did not say his employer could not point out any particular right of way.
Their LOsinSinS have reserved judgment.

Vice-Chancellors' Courts, Feb. 12.
VICE-OHANCELLoRs' COTRTs Vvm 19 __ CLARKE V. T,E ROYAL PA2NOPTICON.
(Before Vi4XChancellor Sir E.. T. K&DxRsLzyE.)
this case comes on upon two motions to dissolve an intunction granted by his Honour in the long vacation at Southampton, to restrain the mortgagees from selling the concern under a power contained in their mortgage deed. The injunction was grantedupon arguLment, and the motions now made to dissolve it were by a mortgagee on the one hand, and by the council of the institution on the other.
Mr. Bally and Mr. C. Hall appeared in support of the motion to dissolve on behalf of the mortgagees who were seling; Mr. Glasse and Mr. Beales appeared for the council on the second motion ; Mr. Rawlinson appeared for another mortgagee, and supported the moving parties; Mr. Terrell and Mr. Stiffe appeared for the plaintiff, and opposed the motions.
Mr. BAILY was heard in reply on the first motion.
The first motion proceeded upon the ground that the defendants, upon the terms of their charter and deed of settlement, were precluded from disposing of the Panopticon, so as to put a stop to it as an institution, although they might deal with it, by sale or otherwise, if it was still to be a going concern. The mortgagee denied that proposition, and contended, moreover, that the plaintiffwas estopped from calling in question what he had in fact sanetioned. The council contended upon their charter that, at all eventg, they had a power to deal with the property as they thought fit, if they could not delegate such power. To this it was answered that the proceedings were irregular, especially those which took place at a meeting in September last, and therefore under any eircumstances they could not sel for the purpose of winding up the affairs.
The VICE-CnAxCELLO1 said that with respect to the second motion it was quite unnecessary for him to go into the question of the regarity of the proceedings, as they took place after the bill was filed and injunction obtained It appered to him upon the charter that the corDoration had full power to deal with their property as they thought fit, with the concurrence of a general meeting, and there was nothing to show that such concurrence had not been obtained. The other subsequent facts might doubtless be introduced by amendment, but at present that injunction must be dissolved. With respect to the mortgagees he should reserve his decision on that motion. The costs of the second motion must be reserved until the hearing.

KIDDELL V. FAINELL.
This was a bill for the purpose of obtaining a declaration by the Court that a gift of a sum of New Three-and-a-Half per Cent. Annuities was, under the circumstances of the case, vald. Onthe20th of July, 1840, one Mary Rose EiddeU, being entitledabsolutely to 13701. 2. Sd. New Three-and-a-HIalf per Cent. Annuities, and being at that time sieriously ill, executed and delivered to her sister, Elizabeth Rose Eiddell, a power of attorney for the transfer of that amount into the name of the latter. The power of attorney contained the usual clause, to the effect that if it were not acted on until after the death of the grantor, the transfer made thereunder should so far as the Governor and Company of the Bank of England were concerned, be as binding on the personal representatives of the grantor as it would have been if such transfer had been made in the life of the grantor, unless notice in writing of her death had been previously given to the Bank. Mary Rose Kiddel died on the 21st of July, 1840, and on the 23d of that month Elizabeth Rose Kiddell, without any know'edge of her sister's death, transferred the beforementioned amount of stock into her own name. The Bank also at the time such transfer was made had received no notice of tho death of Mary Rose Kiddell the grantor of the power of attorney. Elizabeth Bose Eiddeil died in September, 1853, having enjoyed the sum of stock in question during her lifetime. This was a bill by her residuary legatee against the executors of her will and the next of kin of Mary Rose Kidded, praying a declaration to the effect before
Mr. Mains and Mr. Freeman appeared for the plaintiff, Mr. Elmsley and Mr. Bevir for the next of kin, and Mr. Bacon and Mr. BaggaUay for the executors of the wiU of Elizabeth Rose Kiddell.
The VICE-CHINCELLOR said that inasmuch as the peculiar provisions of the power of attorney made the transfer to Elizabeth Rose Kiddell valid, her legal title could not be disputed. The evidence also proved that Mary Rose KiddeU intended to make over the beneficial interest in the fund to her sister, and rebutted the presumption of any resulting trust in favour of Mary Rose Kiddell, or those claiming as her next of kin. There must be a declaration in favour of the plaintiff.

PRICB'S PATENT CANDLE COIMPArY (LIaITxD) V. BAU-
IVENS' PATBNT CASTDLE COSIPANY (LnnIMED).
Mr. ROLT concluded his reply in this case
The VimCB CE.cuELLon observed that it was not a case in which the plaintiffs required a motion of this kind for the purpose of bringing their inventions before the public, and that the case had been launched with perfect bonas fids by them, inasmuch as they had great reason from the information given to them to suppose that their patents had been violated. It was not surprising, therefore, that they should have taken these proceedings in order to maintain their rights. In reference to the main question which had been argued, as to the third branch of the second patent, claiming the introduction of steam as a heating agent for the distills
tion of fatty and oily substances in place of flame, his Honour said he had great misgivings as to his own competency to determine upon matters of such a purely scientific description. It had been contended that where the infringement was clearly made out and the enjoyment had been long aned unquestioned the Court would grant an injunction in the first instance. In referencetothe enjoymnent he had no hesitation ineon.
eludmg ttiat there bad been sufficient enjoyment, and enjoyment of that species that if the infringement had been clearly shown an injunction would at once issue. Lookig, however, at the scientific evidence and the doubt he felt in confiding to his own judgment in such a matter, he could not say that there had been that distinct and clear invasion of the plaintiffs' patents as to justify him in granting the injunction. From a merely inferential invasion he could not fasten upon the defendants the consequences of a wul infringement. Not having come to the conclusion upon this part of the case that there had been such a wilful infringement, he should not do more than require an undertaking from the defendants to the tolowing effect-namely, that steam shaU in no case be admitted into their still until the contents of the stil
shall have first acquired a temperature equal to or exceeding that at which the steam is admitted; that no steam shall at any time be admaitted into their still at a higher temperature than the contents of the still, such temperature to be ascertained by thermometerg placed in the stiU and at the point at which the steam is admitted respectively; that 4he defendants will admit two scientific gentlemen, to be named by the Court, into their works for the purpose of being present during the whole or any part of the proces of distillation for any period or periods not exceeding in the whole 12 hours, much persons to give reasonable notice to the defendants as t their tine of coming, and to be at liberty t communicate with the parties, and that the defendants should furnish the plaintiffs with a copy of the exhibit produced in court (being a model of their working
apparafus); subject to this undertaking, the motion to stand over, with libertyto the plaintiffs to bring such action or actions as they may be advised, any action in respect of the alleed infringement of patent No. 2 (as to which the underta g given by the defendants relates) to be brought so as to be tried not later than at the sittings after Trinity term.
IRwD V. RER
Mr. Rolt, Mr. Atherton, Q.C., and Mr. Chapman Barber appeared m support of a motion for a new trial in this case, involving an intricate and complicated question of pedigree, for the purpose of settling the claims of two litigant classes of second cousins of an intestate who died some years ago leaving poperty to a large amount. An inQUir'y before the Chief Clerk1 in the above suit as to next of kin had resulted in a certificate ; this had resulted in an issue; and the verdict of the jury on that issue was now sought to be impeached, in the shape of a motion for a new trial, on the ground of its having been against evidence.
Mr. Daniel and Mr. Renshaw appear to oppose the m3otion, the arguments in support of which were not conchided at the rising of the Court.

Ww"Ws ,Uh a4yts Pmrus, before Lord CAXPiELL and
Specua Juries.A
When the jury had een caled in this case,
Mr. E. JAES rose and said he was happy to announce that the Court and jury would be spared the necessity of hearing this case. T-here had been a great deal of litigation between the parties who were concerned in this prosecution and in the next case which stood in the paper; the litigation had lasted for above six years, and a great deal of bitterness had been thereby engendered Under the influence of that feeling indictments had been preferred on both sides. There was scarcely a phase of litigation wbich the disputes between the parties had not undergone, and, among other courts, it had passed into the courts of equity. The case had been heard before the Lords Justices, and they had intimated a strong opinion that those indictments ought not to be proceeded with. It appeared to the Lords Justices that there had been error and mistake, and nothing more, and that there was no good ground to charge a wilful perversion of truth. Under these circumstances no evidence would be offered to the jury, and a verdict of .cquittal would therefore be pronounced.
Sir F. T}EGE:R desired to add to this statement that his client was a gentleman of the highest respectabilitv, and was fully prepared to meet the accusation, and to disprove it; and this abandonment of the prosecution was entirely the act of the other side, and was not in the least degree the result of any arrangement with his client.
Mr. Serieant BR.uIALNYE made some observations to a similar effect.
A verdict of Not Guilty was then returned.
THE QUtEET V. PFARs.
Sir F. TEZSIGTR repeated the substance of the statement made in the previous case by Mr. James, and said that the Lords Justices having heard the case, and having expressed a strong opinion agamst these prosecutions, his client, in deference to that opinion, at once withdrew from that which he had instituted.
Mr. Serjeant BALLA.n,x added that since the prosecution had been instituted circumstances had come to the knowledge of the parties which showed that the statements that had been made by the defendant were, in fact, true, and there was therefore no hesitation Whatever in adopting the resolution to abandon the prosecution.
A verdict of Not GuiUty was returned in this case.
Lord CAMPBELL then observed that he was happy to find| that these several defendants retired from court without
any imputation on their characters. As to such prosecu- 1 tions, he must declare his disapprobation of them. He did not approve of an indictment for perjury being made (as was formerly the case even more frequently than now) a part of a civil remedy. His Lordship thought that without the assent of a responsible public officer no such indictment should be capable of being preferred.
The rest of the day was occupied in the trial of a cause which was not concluded when the Court adjourned.

(SiOttng in Banco.)
THE GUARDIAIcS OF THE POOR OF LICHFIELD V. GREE .
Ihis was an action brought to recover 2991. 19s. 8d. from the defendant as surety for the treasurer of the Lichfeld union, which came before this Court on a special case stated without any pleadings. It appeared that the treasurer was Mr. Greene, the late banker at Litchfield, whose firm stopped payment at 3 o'clock p.m. on the 31st of December last. The condition of the bond on which the defendant was sought to be made liable was that the said treasurer should "honestly, diligently, and faithfully discharge the duties of his office." On the 28th of December, in the usual course of business, as prescribed by the orders of the Poor Law Commissioners, the plaintiffs drew checks for various amounts on the treasurer in favour of the relieving-officers and of their master. These checks were presented at the bank on Monday, the 31st, at 11 o'clock, when a smaU portion was paid in gold and silver, and the bulk in notes of the bank, some of which were distributed in the course of the day among the vaTious tradesmen by the master before the bank stopped, wbile others remained in hand at that crisis. Under these circumstances the defendant disputed his liability to make good the amounts of the notes so paid over the counter by the treasurer and which were returned to the plaintiffs by the tradesmen, as well as of those still in hand, on the ground that the checks had not been duly and promptly presented, as they ought to.have been, on the Saturday, and that the acceptance of the notes of the bank on the Monday amounted in law and in fact to payment by the treasurer, so that he had, in truth, honestly, diligently, and faithfuUy discharged his duty.
Mr. PHssxSON, for the plaintiffs, now argued that in neither view was the surety discharged.
Mr. MALconac, for the defendant, on the other hand, contended that if the checks had been presented, as they ought to have been, on the Saturday, they would have been honoured; and further, that when they were presented on Monday, and country bank notes were accepted which were then good and current, the treasurer must be taken to have
aid the amount, it being entirely within the option of the party presenting the checks to ask for coin instead of such notes,
The COURT took time to consider its judgment.
There being great difficulty in procuring the attendance of counsel engaged inthe fewremaining cases during the sittings at Guildhaill
MIr. Baron MALRviN intimated that the sittings in Banso would not be persevered in any longer, but that the Court would sit, as announced on the 21st ult., to give judgments.
The Court therefore finally adjourned at 1 o'clock.

SI35aONDS V. HUGHEIS AND ANOTHER.
Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Prentice appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Thomas for the defendant Miss Stanley; and Mr. Srifflts for the other defendant,
uges.
This wasan action brought by the plaintiff; an upholsterer, against the two defendants, to recover a sum of 661. 8s. for the hire of furniture, work and labour, and materials supplied. The defendants pleaded never indebted.
F'rom the statement of the plaintiffs counsel it appeared that in 185I Mr. Hushes and Miss Stnley being about to bring out an entertainment to be caled '-the Seven Ages of Woman," the latter applied to the plaintiffto fit up St. Martin's-hall tor the purpose. He refused giving credit to Miss Stanley unless some person would guarantee the pay. ment of his charges. Mlr. Hughes thereupon agreed to become MSiss Stanley's guarantee, nd upon those terms the plaintiff furnished everything necessary to bring out the entertainment. Hughes had since become bankrpt, anId MiEfss Stanley hdad gone to America without paying the plain-
The following evidence was adduced in support of this statement:-
John Simmonds, the plaintiff, said,-I am a silversmith and jeweUer, and also a theatrical upholsterer, carrying on business at Southampton-row, Russe -square. lam largely engaged in fitting up places for similar entertainments. I have been engaged to fit up places for Jenny Lind, Miss P. Horton, and many other persons. In December, 1855, a gentleman named Stammers caled on me on behalf of Miss E. Stanley. On the 5th of December I went at his request to St. Martin's-hall and saw Mr. Hughes, one of the defendants, and also Mr. Headland, the secretary of Itr. Huah, the proprietor of the ball. Mr. Hughes asked me if Mr. Stammers had made any arrane ments with me, to which I replied he had not. e said he wished the fittings to be similar to those in the entertainment of Miss P. Horton. I said that I did not know Miss Stanley, and asked him if he would guarantee me the payment of my charge. He said " Yes ;" he would see me paid every week. I said that I had lost a great deal of money by engaging in theatricals, and that I would havo nothing more to do with them. He then said that he was not a theatrical, being one of the firm of Blomburg, Hughes, and Co., and that he had come to England to managethe London branch of thebusiness. I made a rough sketch of the fittings of Miss P. Horton's entertainment at the time, and subsequently I improved it considerably. Nothing definite was agreed upon at that time. I went again to the hall, and showed Mr. Hughes the improved sketch. He referred me to Mr. Stammers, but that gentleman, having "dined out," was not in a condition to transact business. I called again the next morning, and read over an estimate, in which I offered to fit up the place for 20L. down, and 41 per week during the continuance of the entertainment. I signed a contract to do the work within a certain time. On Thursday, the 0th of December, my men put up the framework. Miss Stanley directed me to make alterations in the work on that and other occasions in the presence of 3Mr. Hughes. The workwas completed on the Mody,as I had agreed. Ael'l the work that was done up to the Friday night was pulled down and re-erected by the direction of Miss Stanley. The samount I sent in was for 851, I charged 51. per week for the hire of the thin for 16 weeks. Imade the extra charge for the extra ork had performed. The amount of the extra work was 51l, which was the usual trade price. The thipgs were taken down without my being present, and were damaged to the amount of 181. In the beginning of May I found out that the real name of Mr. Hughes wasO'Keith.
Cross-examined by dr.. GRIFFITS.-Stamme.s told me that Hughes had nothing whatsver to do with the manage-
mentof te entertainment. I gavecreoit to Miss Stanley,andI took Mr. Hughes simply as her guarantee. I understood I from MIr. Stammers that he was Miss Stanley's partner. The
Ferformance took place on the Monday, as advertised. I don't know that any apology to the public was made in consequence of the incomplete state of the fittings. Comulaints were made that I had not supplied what I had undeitaken to supply. They complained that there were Lo lamps sup.
lied, but there were no lamps ordered. The only thing I did leave undone was the cornice. I told Mr. Hughes thero would be an extra charge for the extra work, but I did not mention any particular sum. I made an affidavit upon which the defendants were arrested. In that affidavit I claimed the amount I now seek to recover as due for the hire of furniture.
Joseph Stammers.-I am a musical director and dramatic manager. I first knew Hughes about six or seven years ago, when he went by the name of O'Keith. He was travelling at that time. I first knew Miss Stanley in 1S55. Mr. O'Keith introduced me to her. She wa' living with her zother in Gerard-street, Soho. I know from Mr. Hughes that he and Miss Stanley had been living together as man amnd wife.
The LoRD CHIEF BARox.-That is rather ungahant towards Miss Stanley. How do you know it ?
Witness.-Oh, my Lord, it was well known among the musical profession. It was no secret. It was notorious. They were not living together at the time this place was taken. Before I called vpon the plaintiff I received an application from Hughes. lie said there was a new entertainment getting ready between himself and Miss Stanley, and he ied mo to take the management or join in the speculation. I had only seen him once before. I said I could not undertake it. I saw miss Stanley before I went to the plaintiff. Hughes introduced me to her. The reason of my being introduced to her was for the purpose of my taking tne management of the affair. It was their entertainment, which I was to manage at a salary. They had been so long partners that it was well understood that they were partners without it being distinctly stated. The ters of our rrangement were reduced to writing. I arranged to join them, but they subsecouently repudiated that agreement. The arrangement was wit Miss Stanley and Mr. Hughes. That agreement was that I and Mr. Hughes should eniplov Miss Stanley, and pay her a xlary out of the profits. Mr. Hughes said that he could not appear as manager, in consequence of a charge having been trumped up agains him. e said he had been acquitted. The reason Miss Stanley's name could not appear in the management was because no lady or gentleman giving an entertainment could be manager, as they could not " puff" themselves. Mr. Hughes said that he had money to pay the debts, whether it turned out successful or not. I aid that, as my name was in repute with the public,[[ would not accept a salary, but that I would have one-third of the profits. Mr. Hughes said that Mrs. Stanley said her daughter ought to have one-half of the profits, and we might divide the other half between us. I said, " Then Mrs. Stanley may give the entertainment herself." It was subseguently agreed, however, that we should each have one-third of the profits. This is the book of the entertainment. We all three did the best we could to keep the thing afloat. I went to Mr. Siinmonds about the fittings. The Lentertainment was produced, and both the
,ublic and the press said it was very successful. I know 3Sr. Hughes and Miss Stauley's handwriting,
Is that Mr. Hughes's handwriting 9
Witness.-How did you come by this letter? It is written by Hughes, but it is my letter.
Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeaut THOMAS.-The book I have put in comes under " the right of publishing and sell-
ing the programmnes and words of the enter-ainument," I which Mr. Hughes and myself reserved to ourselvea. That was part of the agreement that was never carried out. Mr. Hughes wrote a letter to me, desiring to break off our second agreement. I wrote a letter, refusing to give up any right I had. Miss Stanley is now in America, where she is performing an engagement which she owes to my exertions, for which she received 3,000. I brought an action 1 in the Court of Common Pleas against Miss Stanley to recover my share of the profits arising from the entertainment. Tse moneywas paid into court by Miss Ssanley, but the question denending upon affidavits, and there being two sweaing aainst one,aI did not succeed, and the amount was repaid to Miss Stanley. Miss Stanley never paid anybody - nobody was paid, except the landlord, who stopped the rent. I swear nobody was paid, except some persons who received a few aixpences. I don't require to be cautioned. I never saw anybody paid, but I beleve the pnuter was paid 401. The plaintiff has fitted up rooms for me during the last 19 years. Miss Stanley lived with her mother for a considerable period before this affair. Hughes lived in Gray's-inn-place. I was not introduced to Miss Stanley until December, 1855. I had previously had a communication with Miss Stanley which had conie to nothing. I had never seen Miss Stanley living with Mr. Hughes. Mfr. Hughes assured me that allcriminal intercourse betwveen himself and Mliss Stanley was broken off as a drawing-room entertainment given by her would not have answerodif ithad been knowrn that she had such a connexion with such a man.
Cross-examined by Mr. GRiFFrrs.-I was present on the openingnight, and made an apology to the public for the incomplete state of the fittings.
Thomas Headlad, the aecretary to the proprietor of St. Martin's-hall, produced an agreement forthe hire of the ball for the purposes of the entertainment, which, however, on account of some informality, could not be read
Cross-examined.-He had let the hall to Mr. Hughes. The receiptfor rent was given to Messrs. Hughes and Stammers.
Thomas Brown was engaged in the entertainment as the pianist. Mr. Stammers en aed him originally, but he had received a letter from Mr. Hughes, begiuning Miss Stanley requests you willnotleave theorchestra during the entertainment."
James Flood, an upholsterer, said Miss Stanley and Mr. O'Keith,oterwMise Mr. Hughes, lived at his house as man and wife in 1845.
James Reed, a milliner, said Mr. O'Keith bad lived at his house with Miss Stanley as her husband in 1817, 1848, and 1849.
The LORD CH=F RABoN.-If the jury are to find according to the moral guilt of the parties, this evidence is important; but, if not, it is utterly worthless.
Thomas Solway said Miss Stanley had ordered a lookingglass and some wig boxes from him, for the purposes of this entertainment, for which she herself had paid.
Mr. PRENTICE said he should put in the schedules of Mr. Hughes in his four bankruptcies, as well as his conviction.
The LORD CxEF BARON.-Under what pretence do you put them in? I shall not admit them; they havo nothing whatever to do with the question before us. Is that your case ?
Mr. PRENTCE.-Yes, my lord.
The LORD CHmx BARoN.-Then, I am of opinion that there is no evidence of the joint contract. In fact, a joint contract is disproved.
Mr. PRZNTICZ submitted that Miss Stanley was a partner, as she was to receive one-third of the profits.
His LOisDsH said he was of a contrary opinion. Was the orginal agreement in which Miss Stanley was engaged by Mr. Hughes and Mr. Stammers a fraud upon the public ?
Mr. Stammers was recalled, and said that the original agreement was to have been kept from the public. It was entirely between themselves.
Eis LORDSHiP said he was still of the same opinion.
Mr. PRENTICE then asked his Lordship to strike out Miss Stanlev's name.
The LORD CHXF BARoN.-I will give a distinct answer totbat. Iwillnotdoso. Iwilltakenosuch stepin a case where I think the parties might have known what their position was before bringing the action. I think the power of the judge to strike out a name should not be exercised in cases where persons enter into a sort of speculation by putting down a number of names, and then, when they find it does not succeed, ask the judge to strike them out. You have in the present case chosen to cast imputations upon the condition of one party, and have unnecessarily brought forward the profligacy, or rather the allegedprofligact, of both parties, although I don't see from the evidence, that it is at all proved against Miss Stanley, and you have made it a cardinal point in the case, as if you supposed that justice was to be administered not according to the legal proof of the plainti'sclaim, but according to the offences and crimes you chose to impute to the defendants. Therefore I will not use the power I have to render you assistance by striking out the name of Miss Stanley. I think there is no enidence to go tothe jury, and therefore I shall direct the plaintiff to be nonsuited.
The plaintiff was nonsnited accordingly.
RMT V. 2IASTERMAN.
Mtr. Eawkins and Mr. Joyce appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Piguott for the defendant.
This was an action brought by the plaintiff by his next friend to recover compensation from the defendant, the treasurer of the Commercial Dock Company, for injuries sustained by reason of the negligence of the defendants in not properly guarding their promises. The defendants pleaded "Not guilty," and that the plaintiff was unlawfully upon the premises of the defendants.
Before the whole case was stated on behalf of the plainMr. Serjeant PIGGOTT said that the defendants, although they did not admit their liability, had consented, out of generoeityJ to give the boy a sum of 50l., and to pay all the plaintiff's costs.
Verdict for the plaintiff accordingly for 50?.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, Feb. 12.
COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, BaiwhRhaWtr..4 Feb. 12. do lIN RE JOHN PAUL.
(Before Mr. Comri.soncr Go=tun x.1
ftis hONOuR said there were circumstances in this case of a character out of the ordinary course, and somewhat remarkable. Paul was adjudicated bankrupt by Mr. Commissioner Evans upon evidence wbich was abundantly satisfactory both as to the trading and act of bankruptcy. Ho gave notice of his intention to dispute the adjudication, which, standing as he then did, he was entitled to do. He was heard and witnesses were caUed. There was an adjournment for a further hearing. During that interval Paul was conNicted of felony, and being an attainted felon it occurred to him (the commissioner) in the course of the proceedings that the Uourt was in an anomalous position. It was a principle in law that an attainted felon lost all rights, and he thought Paul had no locu standi. It occurred to him that he ought at once to stop the case - it, however, went on, and other evidence was given. He had since found that the same point had arisen half a century ago in the case of a man named Bullock. That case came before Lord Eldon, and was reported in the 14th volume of Vesey, jun., page 452, the judgment of the Chancellor being in the 464th page. It was also reported in the first volume of Taunton, page n. It appeared that in 1807 Bullock surrendered to his bankruptcy. He was indicted for tho offence of secreting goods to the amount of 201. The offence, "as then capital, and the sentence was almest uniformly executed, although it appeared that in Bullock's case hs life was not taken He was tried by Mr. Justice He*th in 180S, and convicted. Objectons were raised to his conviction, and .although the. judgment of the judges wfas never givent their opinion wras known to be advers to the prisoner. The question was raised that there had been* a pnor act of bankruptcr and a prior doclet. That objection was declared to be no valid one. It was alleged that he was improperly convicted because there was no valid bankruptcy, and the bankrupt's counsel included Sir S. Romilly. The point was then raised whether a man attainted of felony could be heard in a court ofjustice, and Sir S. Romilly htd admitted that if he had been convicted of any other felony he had no locu., sdandi. The man's life wras at stake, and Lord Eldon had said that the single point
!c,r consideration was, whether be could do anything as sitting to administer justice in bankruptcy. It was exteemely difficult to hold thn petitioner attainted of felony to be heard, the retitionci's object not being for the direct object of reversing the attainder. The man was not executed, but it was clearly laid down that an attainted felon could not be heard on a petition like the one now before hbm. He should now direct an order to be made that the Court having been informed that the bankrupt has been attainted with felony declines to hear him any further in the matter. If it had been previouslv shown that the adjudication ought to be reversed it would have been his duty to act upon the evidence before him; but, looking at the depositions from first to last, he was entirely satisfied that thi adjudication was right in all respects, and that it ought to be confirmed. With reference to the objection that the trading had ceased it had been a settled point that where a trading had been once established it was assumed to continue unless the contrary should be proved. His Honour cited " Ha-nay and Birch"1 (1 Rose, p. 3.36, and Campbell, vol. 3, p. 233) in support of this view; also " Ex parte Mfagennis"' (1 Roge, p. 84), in which it WAS held that it was not so much the quantity of the trading as the intentions of the party. One 'was satisfied that in this case it was the intention of the parties that it should be a continued trading. There was another objection, and a case had been cited in its support, that where a trader absented himself not with the intent to delay his creditors, but to avoid justice, that such absence was not an act of bankruptcy; but if a man so absenting himself left no part" to meet his payments, and it should be shown that creditors were actually delayed, a man was presumed to intend the necessary consequences of his own acts. On that point, therefore, as wel7 as others, he was bound to confirm the adjudication.
Adjudication confirmed accordingly.
The bankrupt, who was in court during the time, and was permitted to shake hands with mnembers of his family, of apparently great respectability, was then taken back to prison.
J. W. Knights, corn-merchant, of Ipswich, passed his examination unopposed, on accounts showing debts 6,230l, and ssets about 1,500L, subject to a disputed claim thereon.
A petition was filed for adjudication of bankrnptcy

(Bcforc AMr. CREASY.)
James Curling, porter, was indicted for having stolen the sum of 21. 10s. 6d., the money of James Butlin.
Mr. Sleigh appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Cooper for the prisoner.
The case was simply this-the prisoner was occasionally employed by the prosecutor, a linendraper carryingon busi. ness in Shoreditc4 to assist in closing the establishment - and soon after hewasso engaged the key of the till was lost, and from time to tine money, amounting in the aggregate to 501. or 601., was missed. In consequence some halfcrowns and shillings were marked; they were missed, and subsequently found concealed in a watereloset, which the prisoner had been seen to go to. The money was wrapped up in a piece of cloth, which was proved to belong to the prisoner, and close to the til a button of a peculiar kind was pickedt up, which corresponded with those on the prisoner's trousers, one of which was wanting. The prisoner had had an opportunity of access to the tiL.
The Jury found the prisoner Guilty.
Mr. CREASY sentenced him to 12 months' hard labour.

It appeared that the prisoner attempted to commit a larceny at the house of Mr. Stebbing, 1, woymouth-terrace, on the evening of the 27th of December, when he was discovered behind the parlour door by the prosecutrix of the present indictment. She courageously collared him, and he straggled hard to get away, but she held him so tightly that he dragged her along the passage until they got to the door, when she h d to let go her hold, but in the struggle she tore a button off his coat. The prisoner opened the door and ran off, leaving the prosecutrix on the ground, she having faUen down with such violence that her aide was much hurt. Mr. Stebbings was attracted to the spot by his sister's screams, an he went after the prisoner and brought him back. He denied that he was the man, but the button torn from his coat settled that question. He had got into the house by means of a skelton key.
Mr. LEwIs addressed the jury.
The prisoner was found Guilty and sentenced to 10 mouths hard labour.
Mr. CRrAsy regretted that the act did not authorize him to order a pecuniary reward in such a case, or he certainly should have directed one to be given to the prosecutrix for her praiseworthy conduct.

POLIOE.
WANSrOf-%HomSE,--Joseph WiUiam Hawes, who had been "emionally assistant to Paul, who was at the last session of the Central Criminal Court found guilty of having been concerned in the nefarious frauds on the City of London Vinion, was brought up for final examination.
The following is the additional evidence:-
Mr. Robert Woodward, of Lime-street, collectorof the poor and church rates of the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft,
aid,-The parish is one of the parishes within the City of London Umon. Before and up to the 18th of November
last I handed to a person named John Paul, who was assist. I ant-clerk in the union, several sums of money, and on the 18th of November I handed to him 901. more, which, with the former sums which I had given to him, made 2901. Hle was to pay that sum for me into Sn;ith and Payus's bank, on account of the 'Union, to be placed to the credlit of the parish of St. Andrew 'Undershaft. P?aul was to bring me a receipt next morning. I have not :inarked the receipt produced (a receipt for 2001., signed M. Crosoer). I have no doubt this is it, but I cannot swear to it. I put the receipt into my cashboy, and there it rem-ained till I gave it into the bands of Mr. Finlay, one of the guardians. I don't recollect seeing Mr. Heath. the guardian, there. I looked at the amount of the receipt, and I believe the receipt produced is the same. I have no doubt of it. but I don't swear to it, because there is no mark upon it. The following is the copy of the receipt pro-
"T. T. De-. 18 1 *City of London Union.

For Samuel George Smith, Treasurer.
E. CRoOza."
Cross-examined by Mr. Tomlins, attorney for the prisoner.-I knew the prisoner. I don't think he ever said anything to me about this receipt. I was not aware that he knew anything about it.
Re-examined by Mr. aumphreys, for the prosecution.- The prisoner was a clerk in the office, as I supposed, in the union. He has come to my house from Pau ocasionally for money as a loan-not on account of the rates. I never gave him any, and I told him I was surprised at his coming, and he said his master had sent him-he meant Paul.
M1r. S. H. Heath, shoe manufacturer in St. Martin's-1eGrand, said,-I am one of the guardians of the City of london Union. I had possession of the receipt produced when John Paul was brought before this Court. I was at the office of the Union, in St. Mary-axe, on the 18th of December last, examining the treasurer's pass-book, and Mr. Voodward (the witness) came into the room, and I received the receipt produced from the hands of Mr. Thornton, who was then the chairman of the board. I saw the receipt in Mr. Woodward's hand, and he handed it to Mr. Thornton, -who immediately passed it to me. There was much conversation between the guardians and Mr. Woodward on the subject. I put my initials on the receipt at the time, and I saw Mr. Thornton put his initials to the same paper.
Mr. E. S. Crosoer, cashier in the banking-house of Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Smith, said, Mr. Sasnuel George Smith is treasurer of the City of London Union. The receipt produced is not signed by me, nor was it written bymy authority. I do not think it is an imitation of mine. Idid not receive the sum of 2901. expressed in the receipt produced. The printed form of receipt is brought from the Union.
The prisoner said in an emphatic mauner, " I did not do It feloniously in any way whatever, and I disguised my hand in no way whatever. I was called suddenly from my desk by Mr. Paul into his private office, and he placed the paper before me and wished me to write " Received the sum of 2901. from St. Andrew Undershaft," and sign the name " E. Crosoer." I wrote it in the ordinary style, not thinking for a moment what I was doing, and no other words passed, and I left the office.
The prisoner was then committed for trial for the forgery, and the LORD MAYOR refused to take bail for Ilis appearance at the Central Crihminal Court.
EIdward Beard was finally examined upon the charge of havng stolen 73 elephants' tusks, of the value of 1201., the property of Mrs. Riudd, and also upon the charge of having received the same, well knowing that thev had been stolen.

BOW-STREET.-Donations have been received for the 'poor-box of 51. from "T. A. G.," and 2s. 6d. from "C. W. C."
MARL0OsorCI{.-TREET.-Edward Cape was charged with having defrauded Robert Wood, wine-merchant and oilman, No. 132, New Bond-street.
Robert Wood said the prisoner caUed upon him on the evening of the 4th inst., and stated that he was sent by Idajor Maynard, of the 88th Regiment, now at Aldershott, to order some wine, and he read the quantity from a paper which heheld in lis hand. As the order was larger than he was accustomed to receive he told the prisoner he thought it -was intended for Basil Wood. The prisoner replied that could not be, as the Major told him to take it to the shop where he procured a Bologna sausage before he went to the Crimea. Conplainant thea took the order, which was for three dozen cases of wine. The prisoner said he was going to die at the Welington, and, as he was without smnall change, would complainant cash him a check for ol. on Cox and Co.? Believing, from the prisoner's appearance, that he was a respectabls person, he did cash the check, but thenext dady, on presenting it at Cox and Co.'s, payment
There being several other cases of a similar sort against the prisoner, ho was remanded until Saturday next.
Jane Williams, William Johnston, and Jane Johnston, the two latter man and wrife, and well known as notorious begging-petition impostors, were charged with attempting o obtain money by fraudulent pretences from Ur. W. Blamnire, Tithe Commission*office, No. ,St. James's-square

ALIRYLEBOxE.-A gloom pervaded during the proceedings of the court in consequence of an announcement which -was made to the sitting magistrate, Mr. Long, that Mr. Lanes Fell, the chief clerk, had departed this life at an early hour in the morning. The deceased was in the 65th year of his age; he was for a period of 24 years second clerk at the Thames Police-court, and on leaving there he was appointed chief clerk at Marylebone, his services in both courts extending to 48 years. The deceased, who had for some time past been ailing, was in attendance at the court on the previous Thursday, when it was quite evident to all connected therewith that he was phystcaUy incapacitated from performing Iis usual dnty; he was conveyed to his home in a cab, and, as above stated, he there breathed his last. Mr. Long was deeply affected when the sad news was commaunicated to him, as was also every one connected with the court. Our reporter, who, from 24
ears' attendance at the court,has had ample opportunity of forming a correct judgment as to the merits of the "departed,' can truly say that in all the relations of life aS
usband, father, and friend, his goodqualities conspicuously shone. The magistrates have to deplore the loss of a most valuable and faithful clerk and kindhearted man, and the offcers and aUl connected with the court will ever remember the good qualities of the man whose death is so mnuch lanmented.
WEDSTnIINTER.-51. was received from " T. A. G.," ani 51. from " S. E. H. P.," for the poor-box, and acknowledgmnents requested in lT 2hc ime..
WOIss sr-STREET.-About a week ago nearly 100 of the workmen out of employment presented themselves at St. Luke's workhouse, after attending a meeting in Smithfield, to demand relief from the parish authorities. There their atlairs were inquired into, as weL as the lateness of the hour (3 o'clock) at which they made their application would admit, and then about 60 of them came on to this court, certainly in a very orderly and decorous iimanner, to appeal to the magistrate (AIr. D'E vx'oumt-) forsomue aid, they and -their wives and families, as they stated, being near starvation, most of theon having pawned or sold nearly everything that could be so disposed of to procure food, and the parish officers only offering them, in nearly every instance, a ticket for work at stonebreakidng for the next day, and none of them expressing a vehement wisil to accept the other legal alternative of entering the workhouse. The magistrate resmonstrated with thenm upon the unseasonableness of men going about in such large numbers to densand relief, which gave their request the appearance of a threatening demand, but, as every one of them professed anxiety to work if they could get it, and several declared that they and their families had been without food for about the last 24 hours, Mr. IYSyacourt offered to give a shilling to each ma'n who could produce evidence of his wiUingness to work at the only Labour a workhouse could offer him, in the shape of a ticket for stonebreaking, and the number of these was 38. That number, therefore, received the shilling, on the understanding that they wvould go the next day to work, but the next morning Hayward, the warrant officer, reported that, on visiting the stone-yard, he could only find about a dozen of them there. The complaint the men chiefly make is, that the conditions offered them almost amount to hinpossibilities, as, if they enter the workhouse as a temporary refuge, their homes are broken up and they cannot look for work, and if they accept the wvorkisouse labour of stone'breaking it so blisters and destroys their hands as to incapacitate them for their own work, wheii they do get it. As
iunumbers therefore had declined wrrk upon these terms, and others had been obliged to give it up after acceoting it. Mr.
n reacnth the chosen secretary of the unerilploye d work'men , addressed the following letter to the magistrate, to express
the feeling s of the men, and put their case in what he considered its proper light:

Mr. DIE,yxCOunR tberefore cent for Air. X'Hfenth,I and onL 11ii now Aaa-tening the Magistrate Naid,-With respect
to the subject of your written communication to me, Sir, I must express my approbation of the sentiments &vowed by the associated workmen in condemnation of the practice adopted by some of the workmen of congregating and going about with the implements of their calUings in their hands, and, indeed, I may say that I did not believe that those who advise and counsel their fellow-workmen could give their sanction to such conduct. There cannot be a doubt, certainly, that the labour-tests referred to do more or less militate against many of the really industrious poor but it must no; be forgotten that in providing labour at all under such circumstances there is the greatest difficuly to surmount, so that in alleviating the want of one class the same want should not be inflicted upon others, and I can only hope that this very difficult subject will be taken into careful consideration in the only quarter from which such consideration can be of any avail ; as, beyond a doubt, great sympathy should be always evinced for really industrious and deserving men. I see by your letter you request me to be theo recipient of subscriptions on these men's behalf. Now, it is compulsory upon me to decline any such office for the basiness of this court is so fast increasing, and the time and attention of its officers are so engrossed by inquiries into cases which legitimately come withm the province of a magistrate having funds from the poorbox to distribute, that any further labour of that kind is impossible. I have, however, already some pounds in hand, kindly forwarded by Messrs. Grissell and Co., for distribution among the families of the distressed persons you represent, and that money I shall be willing to apportion among such families as, in my discretion, I may consider to be the most deserving of such assistance.
Air. M'Heath, a very inteligent person, expressed his concurrence in the magistrate's observations. and, thanking him warmly for the aid he had already afforded, quitted the court.
CLERKNWET.L.-The sitting magistrate requested our reporter to acknowledge the receipt of the following donations for the poor-box:-` M. P., ' the half of a 56.-note; " X. X.," a cheek for 51. "t.R E.," half of a 51.-note; "M. T.," 10s.; and "E. W.," postage stamps, 5s. Our reporter was also requested to state that a note has been received from "F. X S.," in which he says that he has enclosed a post-office order for the boor-box, but no such order has been received at this court.
SousTrw&ARx-Four rather clean and well-looking young women, but in a destitute condition, were brought before Mr. tcrnsClm charged with causing a disturbance outside the relieving-office at St. George's Workhouse and obstructing the relieving officers in the execution of their duty.
MIr. Townson, the assistant relieving-officer, stated that about 10 o'clock that morning the prisoners surrounded the doors of the office, preventing him from performing his duty. He went and told them to go away, and, on their refusing, he was compelled to call a constable and give them into custody
Mr. BVRCHAx asked him whether he knew anything of them.
He replied that they were admitted into the casual ward on the previous evening and received the usual relief.
The prisoners said they had been most shamefuily treated by the parish authorities. They were destitute, and went before the guardians on Wednesday evening, when those Ã¯Â¿Â½entlemen ordered them to be turned out of the workhouse. TLhey were admitted into the casual ward for the night, and after receiving a little gruel that morning, were thrust into the soneett hat were they to do in their destitute condition buremaiu about the workhouse ?
Mr. BUIICcn&M asked Mr. Towson whether they had been before the guardians.
He replied that they had, and, being able-bodied women, those gentlemen gave orders that they should not be admitted into the house,
The prisoners said they were cruelly treated. They were willing to work if they could get it, and unless they were admitted into the workhouse they must do something else.
Mr. BuRciwi remarked that the conduct of the authorities of the parish was extremely harsh. The idea of thrusting fort such young women into the streeta in a destitute condition was sufficient to force them to prostitution. He should discharge them that time and recommend them to apply to him if they were refused admission in their destitute condition, and he would see whether the officers dape to thrust them out again.
Mr. BuRcirm.na received the second half of a 51.-note from 'M. P. ;" also 11. 7s. from " F. EL," Torquay ; half of the latter being sent to the Lambeth police-court as requested.
LAvsnBsrT.-Yesterday Richard Smith, who has been in custody for some weeks, on suepicion of having caused the death of William Kieffe, alias Pecker, by knocking him on the head and chest with a heavy maUet, was placed at the bar before the Hon. G. C. NORToN for final examination.
Mr. Armstrong, a gentleman residing at Peckham Rye, said he had known the prisoner for upwards of 12 months, from his attending the cricket-ground belonging to Mr. Davis, of the Edmburgh Castle Tavern in his neighbourhood. On the 19th of the last month he (the prisoner) caUed on him and asked if he could assist him to put a stop to the statements going about the neighbourhood detrimental to his character and likely to deprive him of his bread. He (Mr. Armstrong) told him he would, and from his representation he wrote the statement produced by the inspector.
'he statement referred to was here read by the chief clork: * Touching the death of a Person known as Pecker an investigation took place before the coroner, and from a conversation etween the deceased aLd a nurse at the workhouse the investigation was conducted with marked severity towards myself. Nothing was produced in evidence that could throw the slightest suspicion oei me. as in any way sonnected with the unfortunate circumstance, nor oould there be, s I am innocent of any at tending to iniue the deceased, s a man can be wlho never saw him from thu time he was in the ho'lse In tie evening untU he was found in the loft of the stable in which he was at work in the mornig. lr. Cartwright has asserted that on the morning of the 27th of December last I picked the deceased up from among the horses' feet between 6 and 7 o'clock, and carried him up to the l1t, This is depriving me of employmeat, aud is throwing a suspicion on my charazter. I most positively deny having told Mr. Cartwright that I picked up the deceased, for I knew nothing of what had happened un,ti I beardgroans in the loft while cleaningmy horses In the stable below.-, ad vent upand saw him lying ens r mostraw and covered with some tent curtains; sodI am as ignorant of how he caue byhis death as any one can be, and can only imagine that he was kicked by the homes while groping sbout drunk, and in tho dare. bly character being seriouiy affected by such reports, and my already having lost my emplotyment in consequence, I am most desiroa3 ot having this
Mr. Armstrong further stated that he had attended at the coroner's inquest held on the body of the deceased, and having heard nothing prejudicial to the character of prisoner, and certainly nothing to imDlicate bini in the death of the man, he expressed no objection to write the statement for him that had been just read.
A witness named Jenner, who had been examined on a former day, bu' whose evidence had been contradicted by Mr. Laird on the last day of hearing, was recaUed, and when sworn repeated what he had stated on a former day, that on Mr. Laird entering th^ stable and speaking about the blood there the prisoner said that it had been occasioned by two dogs fighting.
Inspector Siiver said that some such conversation must have taken place, as the gentleman, Mr. Laird, when paying his bill, told Mrs. Davis that her servant had told him that the blood in the stable had been caused by dogs fighting - upon which she remarked that it was no such thing, and that it had been caused by his hor3es.
Other witnesses had been recalled, as well as fresh ones examined, and, after a lengthened investigation,
Mr. NORTON remarked that it seemed to him, after giving the case the utmost consideration, that the whole of the difficulties azose from the numerous and varied staements respecting the unforzunate affair given by the prisoner himself, and which appeared to have their origin in his wish to conceal from Mr. Davis, his master, the fact of the poor man being in the loft. It was his (Mr. Norton's) decided opinion, also, that the unfortunate man came by his death by scoid ent, and not from violence at the prisoner's hands; bet if he entertaincd a contrary opinion the evidence was not such as by any means would insure a conviction.
A solicitor who attended for the prisoner said he had some serious conversation 'with his client, and he felt quite satisfied the opinion expressed by his Worship was perfectly iust, and that the prisoner's difficulties arose from his effort to conceal from his master the fact of the man being in the loft.
The prisoner was here discharged; but before leaving the dock he asked what he should do if any person, after what had taken place, charged him with the offence?
MIr. NORTON hoped there would be no necessity for his doing so, but told him that if such a charge was made to apply to him, and he should punish the parties making it.

A meeting has been held, and it has been resolved that the following should be the rate of wages :-namely, for the East Indie4, 3g.; Mediterranean and West Indies 31. lOs.; and America and the Baltic, 4Z. a-month. They have also issued a small placard, in which they express a hope that the shipowvners of Hull will take the matter into consideration for their own benefit as well as that of the seamen, " they well knowing how many shipl have suffered out of that and other ports with taking men unable to do their duty." On this day (Friday) there is to be another meeting for the purpose of forming a procession. A few days ago a number of the seamen on strike placed a foreign sailor in a pot crate, and carried him upon their shoulders along one of the dock quays, it being believed, though erroneously, that he had signed articles to go to Bombay at reduced Wages,-aamely, 21, 10s, -mouth,

Sir,-In 17ie lTimes of the 15th of December last, in the letter from your special correspondent in Canada, dated Quebec, November 26, in assigning the reason why the line of Railway from Montreal to Quebec passes on the southern Instead of the northern hank of the St. Lawrence is the following passage:
: ~~~~~~~~~~~
'Th anweris,thenecssiy o maingthe connexionpwith the
The statement in the latter paragrahs a temiuistake The harbour of lSt. John is open at ad seasons of the year, has never been krown to freeze, and never can freeze ,while the tides of the Bay of Fundy rise and faU as they now do. At this moment, while the ports of Boston and New York are seriously incommoded with ice, the port of St. John is open, ships entering, loading, *nd departing, and the tide rising and falling as regularly, as calmly, and as free from obstruction as in the month of August. St. John, as an ocean terminus through British territory for the Canadian Grand Trunk, is within 200 milese shorter distance than Halifax. The attention of the Legislature and people of this province is now, and has been for some time past, directed to the accomplishment of that object, and it wlll be accomplished before many years. Railways are progressing rapidly in different sections of the province, and the ultimate extension of a line from Quebec, through New Brunswick, to Halifax, is but the work of time. I trust you will correct the iLjustice which, however unintentional, your correspondent has done to the port and city of St. John and the province of New Brunswick.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant

Dreadful Suffering At Sea.-The Black
DREADEn L SUrRDm G AT SEA.-The Black Warrior left New Orleans on the 11th of January, and reached Havannah on the 14th, where she remained till the following day. On the following morning, the weather being as mild as usual forthat latitude, she started for New York. On the fourth day of the passage, when about 40 miles to the noithward of Cape Hatteras, the wind, which had been favourable, freshened considerably, and about 4 o'clock in the morning of the 19th it blew a terrific gale, accompanied with a blinding shower of sleet and snow, which rendered objects at the distance of a few yards invisible. Never did ship, according to the accounts of those onboard,acquit herself better than did the BlackWarrior in this fearfulstorm. The way she rodethrough it inspired them with the greatest confidence in her sea qualities, and the result proved that their faith in her was not misplaced. About 5 o'clock-an hoar after the gale had apparently reached its height-the foretopsail yard came down by the run, and hung suspended by the rigging over the side of the vesseL This, though not very serious, interfered somewhat with the working of the ship, and it was found necessary to cut it loose immediately. A number of men were accordingly set to work, and in a few minutes it was detached from the rigging, and drifted off on the ocean. 'At this time the deck was covered with snow and sleet, and the masts, rigging, and everything that was exposed to the atmosphere, were covered with a coating of ice. Even the clothes of the sailors were frozen stiff wherever the spray had drenched them. Such was the fury of the gale that it was with difficulty the men retained their footing on the deck, and it was almost impossible to face the driving Eleet and snow. During this trying time the passengers, among whom there were several ladies, preserved their coolness and self-possession, and, so far as external appearances may be regarded, there was no indication on their countenances of the dangerous position in which they were placed. At times it seemed as if the vessel would capsize, and, such was the force of the gale, that it held her on her side so that the yards almost touched the water. She had, however, been kept out of the trough of the sea, and, with the exception of the loss of her tore-topsailyard, had sustained no damage. About 12 o'clock of the same day the fuel began to give out, and it was found impossible to raise sufficient steam to keep her under headway. Up to this time, notwithstanding the gale, it might be callUe
smooth saiing in comparison wdth the difficulties they had afterwards to contend against. The fueL as we have said, began to give out, and the vessel, becoming unmanageable, fell into the trough of the sea. It was under similar circumstances that the San Francisco was lost, but the Black Warrior proved herself equal to the perilous position in which she was placed, and, " like a thing of life," battled with the fumy of both wind and waves, and came successfulUy out of the contest, though, as will be seen, somewhat the worse from the encounter. To k-ee her head to the sea the captain had one of the yards, a the iron grate bars that could be found in the ship, and one of the cannon lashed to some spars, with the cannon in the centre, and threw them over the side of the vessel from the starboard gangway, having first attached them to a 10-inch hawser, which was passed through the foremost chock. This contrivance, it asS thought, by acting as a sort of drag upon the ship, would effect the object in view-that is, it would keep her head to the sea. It, however, proved ineffectual, and the ship still remained in her dangerous position. All the canvass which they had aft was now set, ut itproved of no avail; they had hardly been spread to the wmd when they were torn to pieces, and blown clear from the bolt ropes. All the sail they had left consisted of some tarpauling,which was lashed tothe mizenrigging for the
urp?ose of bringing the steamer, if Possible, to windward; utit was also carried off by the gale. Determined to try again. the men next lashed two sail covers to the mizen rngging. These, however, shared the same fate. They now saw that it was utterly impossible with the means in their power to do anything more, and the ship becoming entirely unmanageable lay in the trough of the sea. She shipped one or two waves, which carried away her paddleboxes and closets, but the hull remained uninjured, although 24 hours exposed to the storm. The next day at 12 o'clock the gale
odrted for a few hours, but it was only kor A fewv hours. Afterx this brief resite the wind changed to the north-west, and in a short time blew with as much violence as ever. This gale was also accompanied with snow and sleet, which rendered all work on the vessel exceedingy arduous and sometimes dangerous. During the gale, which continued for 24 hours, the steamer remained in tce trough of the sea, but behaved as well as ever. On the 21st, about 4 o'clock, it became comparatively calm, and they went to work to provide fuel for the purpose of once more getting up steam and making for the nearest port. The bulkheads were cut up, the main and mizen topmasts, the sailors' and firemen's berths, and all the spars were converted into firewood. The ladies' saloon escaped the axe but it would most probably have been cut up too, if reduced to the lastextremity. With this fuel they succeeded in getting up steam, and made at once for Chesapeake Bay. Here, however, they met another, and what nearly proved an insurmountable obstacle. The ice, which was observed in immense fields all along the coast, blocked up the entrance, and it is hardly probable that they would have got in had it not been for the fortunate appearance of a pro ller bound from Charleston to Baltimore. The steamer tookthe Black Warrior in tow and brought hr to Hampton Roads. where she camne to anchor. That night it blew a gale, and the steamshig dragged her anchors across the roads to a place called t 0 RaPids, where she ran ashore and lay surrounded by thick ice. 'The tide, however, drifted her off again, when a smnall steamboat came alongside and suppleod her with sufficient fuel to get steam up and proceed to the wharf, Here they tookin asamuch as they couldget, which barely proved enough to bring them as far as Sandy Hook. With thsis Captain Smaith proceeded to sea, but the ice, which nearly prevented them from getting into the Chesapeae, niow reene a barrier to them on their way out. Hewas oli-ged, on account of the great quantities of it, to make his way very slowly, and it required all his vigilanxce and care to prevent his vessel from bing s- riously damaged by the imimense frozenmasses which hemet on his way out of the bay. It was 11 o'clock onx Statrday last when the Black Warrior left the Chegapeakce. During the passage, as we have stated, they sawv large fields of ice, and it was with the greatest difficulty she could keep clear of them. The -weather continued pretty moderate from this Point to INew York, with a fair breeze to the northwad When inside of Sandy Hook, however, their fuel was exbausted, but they fortunately found a towboat, which supplied them with enough to bring the ship to her dock, at the foot of Robinson-street. While coming up the bay a meetng f pssegerswashel inthecabin, for the pur-

Samaritan Institution.
SAl.rITA I1VS2ITÃ¯Â¿Â½UTION.
A special meeting of the subscribers and friends of this institution was held yesterday at the dining-hal of the institution, Victoria-street, Regent-street.
The Rev. J. W. LAUGHmI.N, Ineumbent of St. Peter's, Saffron-hill, took the chair, and said, that he bad been induced to do so from a sense of duty towards a man who had been most unjustly treated. He spoke with authority when he advocated the utility of the Samaritan Institution. He was authorized to use the name of the Rector of St Andrew's, Holborn, as to the geat assistance and relief the institution had been the means of affording to the poor during the winters of 1854 and 855. From his own personal knowledge he could state that the tickets issued from the institution had always been complied with, and that on no occasion had any complaint been made in the supply of food, either in respect of quantity or quality.
The Secretary then read a report of the operations of the institution during the past winter. Relief in food had been afforded to 70,615 destitute persons. Divino service had been attended by 17,274 persons on the Sunday, besides 6,417 on the afternoons on the Wednesday, to whom a warm meal was given. The free baths and lavatories had afforded accommodation to 14,581 houseless poor. 1,650 destitute persons were provided with a substantial dinner on Christinas-day, 1855 The hungry and destitute wayfarer was never turned from the doors without relief upon the first application; but if he came a second time inquiries were made respecting him, and, if found deserving, he was assisted until he could obtain work.
The Secretary read letters from persons who had derived benefit as recipients from the institution, and bearing testi. nony to its great practical utility.
Mr. J. CLARK moved a resolution to the effect that, s workhouse relief was inadequate to meet the wants of the poor, that meeting pledged itself to use every means in its power to carry out the principle of the Samaritan Institution in the most comprehensive manner. He had originally entertained strong prejudices against the institution, but, after a full investigation of the manner in which it was worked he had arrived at the conviction that it was a most excelent chaity. Considering the objects it professed to effect, he thought it extraordinary that there should have existed anything like a prejudice against it. The utility and necessity of such an institution wasprini4facic evidence of its being an honest and bond fjde undertaking. Considering the charges which had been made gainst the secretary, he was at first disposed to form a very nnfavonrable view of the working of the institution; but, having looked at the evidence adduced, he had come from the investigation with a full conviction of the innocence of the secretary and of the importance of the institution itself.
The resolution, having been seconded by Mir. H. Low, was unanimously ado pted.
The Rev. Dr. BAxs said, he had read statements in the papers, more or less accurate -some giving the charge against the secretary without the defence-a mode of proceeding which he considered to be discreditable on the p art of the press-a7 d the effect on his mind was that r. Barber had been mos' unjustly treated. By the law of the land every man was considered inno3ent until he had been proved to be guilty; and those wko were appointed to exercise powcr and authority in the name of the Sovereign ought well to examine the character of the person who made the accusation, and also of those whom they adduced in evidence. He understood that the person who made complaint against Mr. Barber was a tradesman in Farringdori-street, who had never been within the wals of the institution, nor had ever contribated a farthing to its funds. 'he evidence adduced against the institution was of the most doubtful character; and it was the duty of the magistrate who investigated the case to have been most scrupulous in his inquiries as to the credibility of the witnesses. But the whole matter was an cx pairc statement, and the mode of conductinq the examination before the magistrates at Guldhallwas open to severe remark. It was the law of England and also of the old Roman Empire, that no man should be condemned tUlI he hid met his accuser face to face. Now, he would ask what had the accuser in this case to complain of? Had any of his herbs (for he was a herbst been taken to make soup for the poor? He had nocomplaint; he bad never suffered from the committee or the secretary of the institution, he (Dr. Barber) could notthereforeconceivewhyor wherefore he should have shown this ill-will towards the institution, unless, like the man of Ephesus, he wanted to make a martyr of himself There was nothing to warrant the proceedings which had been taken against their secrstary. He (Dr. Barber) had been connected with their institution long before Mr Barber was its secretary. It was his privilege to be present with Alderman Hunter, late Lord Mayor, at the opening of the institution After havin failed, itwas reopned under the auspices of Sir Fitzroy Kelly, who cortribu ed munificently towards its support It had been aad tbat Sir F Kelly rearetted that he had ever been connected with the institution, but that was not true. To a deputation who waited on him he expressed himself in the highest terms as to his goodwill towards the institution, and subsequently to these proceedings against Mr. Barber he subscribed a guinea to the annual dinner, and five guineas to the general fund of the institutiomi (Cheers.) In reference to the proceedings taken against their secretary he would ay, speasang as an Englishmnar, as a minister of the Gospel, and as a clergyman of the church of England, that such an accusation should neverhave been entertained upon evidence of so disreputable a characler. (Hear, hear.) The 3Iev. gentleman then moved-
"That this meettng sincerely regrets that tbe publication of exparte statement. made under colour of a judicial inquiry at Guildlhall, and for which there was Po warrant or justification whatsoever in fact, has tended to greatly diminis the resources ef the institution at a periodi when its active oertosweinperati veyCledfrb
pulcnecessity" us ere Ipeaivl ca,l|ledto fatb Mr. Barber, the Secrery, took the opportunity of saying, that while in the year 1855 the institution had a balance in its favour of .31t it was now, in conisequence of the pr33udice it had sustainedi by reason of the hostile pro. ceeding taken against him at Guildhall, upwards of 2801. in
Mr. C. HousELEY seconded the resolution, and said that the result of his investigation of the proceedings of the institution justified him in giving it his cordial support.
A gentleman in the body of the meeting asked whether it was true that the sum of 1,2C01. had been contributed to the funds of the institution, and that at the same time the building in which the institution was held had not been paid for?
Mr. Barber, the secretry, explained that the debt for the buildirg was incurred by Mr. Charles Cochrane, who, being unable to pay it, left the country; that a compromise afterwards was made with the creditors, but that thepresent holders of the premises were in no way Iable for the debts contracted by that gentleman, they having taken the building from the landlord, wholly irrespective of the debts due from the late Mr. Cochrane.
Mr. PALMIER said, he was the builder and fitter-up of the premises. It was true that Mr. Cochrane gave orders as to the fitting-up of the place, but at that time he did not know Mr. Cochrane. He transacted his business with a committee composed of the Lord Mayor, Sir F. KeUy, and some eight or ten rev, gentlemen.
Mr . 0 DOYLE then moved the following resolution:-
"That this meeting sinoerely congratulates the able and Indefati. gable secretnxy of the institution, ir. 8X. P arkc Barber, upon the
Tne resolution having been seconded was carried unani-
Avote o thanks to the chairman then closod the proceedings.

Poison.
POISON.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMIES.
Sir,-The conjecture of your correspondent "W. B." as to the naturo of the poison contained in Buttle's " Vermin-killer" is perfectly correct. I had occasion to examine it some months ago in connexion with an animal-poisoning case, and I fotnd that the poisonous constituent was strychnine. Of course it is mixed with gypsum or some other terthy matter, and a little colouring, probably smalts, whicl gives a light blue; but this did not engage my attention, as my sole object was to ascertain the presence of strychnine.
It is put up in smaU thin packets, in yeloow paper, scarcely thicker than tiesue paper, so that the slightest abrasion would cause the deadly contents to fall out.
The sale of this article by druggists, grocers, drysalters, kc., is strikingly illustrative of the fearful laxity both of law and practice as to the sale of poisons.
I remain. Sir. vsnr nh-lAia,-+ ---

Prussian Police.
PRUSSrAN POLICE.
TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In the year 1849 I fought in Baden against th&e Prussians. In a battle of three days I had the good luck. to repulse them from Mannheim. Afterwards I defended Rastadt, as chief of the general staff, and was made a priEoner. By. the court-martial I waa condemned to be shot,
but, one of the judges dissenting, the Badish Government, altered the verdict to 10 years of house of correction. lneof these 10 years I endured by an imprisonment of six year in a solitary ceU at Bruchsal, in Baden, eight months oE solitary confinement being equal to 12 months' ordinary house of correction. This being the highest lawful term oE solitary confinement, I was ret free. In my youth I had,r been a lieutenant in the Prus6ian army, but forinany years I had become a subject of Saxony and citizen the: city of Leipsic. Provided with a good passport Vlived. without molestation in a little spa of Nasson-Soden, near Frankfort. Then I went to 1ondon, where I stayed for several months. In the summer of 1856 I returned to Soden, where I stayed till the last December. From there I, went to Hamburg, and received here a ticket of a6jomr till.
the 15thof March in return for my passport and a caution of' one of the mostrespectable citizens of this city. Being in bed with a gastric-nervous fever, one morning agents of the' police entered my bedroom and offered to arrestme wrapped in cushions. But seeing me too ill they contented themselves with carrying off all my papers, and even those of my wife. By one of the policemen I war told I was owing this to a Prussian requisition. The policemen showed no warrant, nor did they give me a rer ceipt for my papers. The other day I was visited by a higher officer of the police, who made me know that my papers were sent to Leipsic, and that I was to receive my passport, directed to Leipgic, as soon as I should be able to move. On my way to Leipsic I would have been forced to traverse Prussia, and in this manner I would have been given directly into the hands of the Prussians ; IXwould have been carried off to Berlin, whetre I might have pined away in some oublieUc at Spandan. A few days before my leaving the prison M. Von Hinkeldey paid me a visit in my cclU; he uttered against certain persons" that if I had done with Baden I had not done yet with Prussia." And yet I had been punished so severely only for my having combated in Baden against the Prussians ! Since my setting free I have abstained from any political activity. Plandered of all I had, a stranger to the world, Iand being ill from a six years' solitary confinement, I had to
do more than enough to support myself and wife by my literary labous I did not even write for political papers. I cannot imagine by what I might have given offenco to Prussia, if not by an article in Household Words,where my adventures have been told.
To go to England was impossible for the ice. Having given no promise to the polico of Hamburg, I could find in my heart to deceive her, not having a mind to die in a Prussian prison without any reason. So ill I was I put on women's clothes and quitted, with the help of good friends, the territory of Hamburg. Without having committed any offence I am hunted by the Prussians and their servile servants like a deer, and have no other help left but to invoke that of the powerful press.
Perhaps this sample of Prussian perfidy and continenta management will interest you. A subject of Saxony, with a very good passport, is treated like a criminal by the police of Hamburg, without any motive but the bon plaisir of the Prussian Government, which has a wanton desire to keep my person, perhaps thinking by this to prevent the publication of my memoirs, which are announced already by Hoffman and Campe, of Hamburg. The seized papers con-- tain nothing which could have any interest to the police.
Excuse, Sir, my bad English.
Yours faithhtlly,
OTTO VON CORVIN.

Cotton And Indian Railways.
COTTON AND INDIAZ? RAILWA YS.
TO THE EDITORt OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-With reference to the remark of the President of the Manchester Obamber of Commerce in his speech reported in The Timnes of to-day, that "in connexion with the Indian railways the objects of the East India Directors appeared really to have been more military and political than commercial," I would venture to mention two lines which have been sanctioned for express commereial purposes, the chief of those purposes being the developspent of the resources of the cotton-producing districts and the establishinent of faeilities for carrying on the trade in th%t commodity.
The works I allude to are,-first, the line running into the heart of the districts of Candeisk and Berar to Oomrawn.'ee sand N:gpore, which wivl thus be connected with Pombay; nd, secondly, the line from Surat to Ahmedabad, which passes through the cotton district of Guzerat.
I might also mention the line, 350 miles in length, which proceeds from Mladras in a south-westerly direction to a port on the western coast of India. This work must have been sanctioned chiefly for commereial purposes.
With respect also to the grand " political and military" Une from Calcutta to the north-west frontier, why was this not taken direct across the country, but led by thecircuitous route along the valley of the Ganges, except for the purpose of following the existing channel of trade, and of acconimodating the agricultural districts of that rich valley?
The object of the Indian authorities has, I believe, been to combine as much as possible the political and commnercial advantages of every line that has been determined on ; and in some instances, as I have above shown, the object has been purely commercial.
I may take this opportunity of quoting the following extract from a de patch from the Court of Directors to tho Government of India, dated in August, 1853, which has been printed by order of Parliament, and which will show that the manufacturing interests of this country were not kept out of view when the subject of establishing a system of trunk lines of railway in India was under conssderation:-
" We cordially coucur in the opinion of the Governor-General as to the great pAltict . commercial. and social advantages which must ensue from an extensive snd well-devised system of railways in India. The effects are not, perhaps, within the range of calsulation, nor would they be coillued to Indin alone. The buenfits resudting from the development of the resources of the country, and more especaUlly from the extended growth aud supply of cotton, would. we conoeive, be very sensibly felt in this country. We have been Inxiol5ly lookin forward to the nsiod when a gencral eystem of rairoads might go undertaken. Their fuot introduction was necesLtrily expeimentaL It was emential that the greatest caution sbould heexercisedinDroceeding with undertadangs so vast aud important. Precipitaneywould have produred delay. he subject. however, can now be viewed unobscured by any doubts aId fears as to physical impediments and other difficoltlealand the only questions for eolution are, what lines are best calculated to constitute those trmnk roads which shall becoine tho geat arteries of commuulcadon thronghout the country; aud what means shaU be em-
ieee for executing then ? Amd we tuust here express our satis-
action at the confident expectation of the Governor-General that on lines ' judiciously selected, weu sud economicauy constructed, safely and thriftily worked.' the returns wilU be reraunerative, and that the Government will never *be sailed upon, after a lue thall he in ful
operation, to pay the interest guaranteed upon the capitaL' There Is much to enconrage in this opinion. for the fnancial 8ucoess of worke of Dubhbcenefit in a country tho population of whicb requires all theimpulse that FDnglich energy and enterprle can gire meat have a- most Isautary effect upon the characterand feelings vf tho people."
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

RAGGED SCHOOL SHOEBLACKS.-Last night the usual annual treat to the boys forming the Shooblack Brigade of the various schools in the metropolis took placo at
t.Martin's-hall, Lord Shaftesbury was in the chair, and among those present were Lord Robert Grosvenor, X., tho hon. Arthur Kinnaird, M.P., S. Whitbread, MIP Mr. Ingham, MLP., Sir S. Morton Peto, Sir R Carden, Mr. Joseph Payne, the Duchess of lrpll Lady Cranworth, miss Albertine Grosvenor, &c. The DO havingbeenplentifuDysuppliedwith plumcake,tea, bread an
butter, &o., tho chairman addressed them in an earnest manner,begging them to adopt habits of industry,of honesty, and morality, and impressing upon them that their future well-- being depended upon their conduct now towards men and on the fulfilment of their duties towards their Maker. H1e' said he was rejoiced to hear such Rood accounts of them for the past,and assured them rhat if they continued to actupon the good principles they seemed to have imbibed, he saw no reason why they all one day should not rise to be chairmen of a ragged school shoeblack meeting like that,-an honour which he considered far greater than that of being Premier, Lord Chancellor, or filling any such high position. A number of gentlemen addressed the meeting on the progress of' the boys during the last year, and gave some statistics in con. nexionwiththem. ItappearedthatL theCityof Londonalone during the last 12 months no less a he'm had been earned bythese boysin blacking shoes thau 2,7i1l. During the 1st;. ten months the Red Brigade had earned &total sum of1,4451.; this was earned by 54 boys on an a'erage, being. about 12M. per week for each boy. Gs. per w&k of this was given to the boy to subsist upon, 3s. set apart for him in the savings' bank, and the remaining 3s. went towards the* expenses of the socity. The Blue Brigade had not beens, successful, owing to their numbers being smaller and thelr standings not so profitable; their total earnings for the year amounted to 600!. earned by 44 boys. The Yellow Bri'ade. had a total of 630i., their numbers being still less. Severd of the best boys, those who had distinguished themselves bytheir good conduct and the amount of their ealnungs. Tepre. aenting each of the brigades, ware then brought to the pla.
form and received from the chairman medal in reward of:
their good conduct.
